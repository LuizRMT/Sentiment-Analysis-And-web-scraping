0,jessejojo,"Aug 29, 2019",7,"So ... i just finished the game and I dont know how to feel about this. First up gameplay:The gameplay and shooting mechanics are great and I really like them. The game offers several abilities which are just fun to use like force push, hovering etc. In fact, killing stuff with ur ""force"" is so much fun it makes me think about the upcoming Star Wars game of EA and that they should really get behind it. Be aware though, some abilities you will only find if you go after some side quests, which brings me to the next point. There are a couple of sidequest even after finishing the game which vary between really interesting (bosses etc) and absolutly pointless gather or kill missions. Some of this quests are even timed but there is not a single reason to complete them. You will find this quests across the map which is probably my biggest problem with the game. Traversing in this game, atleast at the beginning, is horrible. The map in this game just sucks and i didnt count how many times I was lost, but it sure was a lot. I dont know who thought about this map, but it really should be handled differently. Sometimes you have to figure out that some elevators take you to different places which are of course not marked on your map. After a couple of hours you will get the hang of it and understand the map but this shouldnt be a thing. Lets get to the story.To be honest ... I dont know what to tell you about the story, because on the one hand I feel like the story and the characters are really well done but on the other hand I am not sure if i actually understood anything that happened in the game. This is probably where all this 10/10 reviews come from but just because the story is complicated, it does not mean the story is good. Its definitely entertaining but not worth a 10 out of 10. At some point int the game I thought i understood the plot and the whole story around it but no ... the game keeps throwing confusing things at you which are never cleared up or make any sense at all. Best example would be the whole janitor thing. Graphics and performance:The game looks really good and they definitely put some work into the maps and special effects. Sometimes the characters look a bit off just like in Quantum Break but thats not a killer for me.Personally i had no problems running the game, but others keep complaining about it. Thought i should mention that. Also ... I am talking about the PC version here but I have seen some framerate tests of the game on ps4 and xbox, where the game falls as low as 12 frames which is simply unacceptable. The physics in this game are very well done, which is probably why the consoles have such a hard time running the game. Everything you touch, control or run into actually moves accordingly ... atleast most of the time. Conclusion:If you like Quantum Break you will definitely like this game aswell. For all others, I would advice to wait for a price drop because I think the game is worth about 40 bucks. It offers some solid shooter fun for ca. 8 hours if you rush through the story and way more if you care about sidequests. If it werent for that overall confusing story with more or less no real ending and a terrible map, i would give this game a higher score."
1,pamev,"Sep  3, 2019",4,"The gameplay gets repetitive very quickly but the voice work and writing is awful from the very first minute. Less compelling words have never been less convincingly delivered. Honestly, the idea that real, living, adult human beings earned a wage writing the words being spoken in this game is mind-boggling. Still, there's no denying it's pretty. Pretty like a painting which can only be viewed in tandem with the world's worst audiobook. Plus stale gameplay."
2,Sane__,"Sep  2, 2019",4,"First, let me begin with that I see myself like an avid Remedy (especially Sam Lake) fan. My childhood is marked by Max Payne & Max Payne 2 and I think that Alan Wake is one of the best experiences I've ever had (I say experiences because the gameplay was not exactly the best I've ever had) Quantum Break was okay-ish. Besides that absolutely epic production value, the game itself was bland at best and the story was 6.5/10 max. But this... I mean, I really expected a lot, a lot more. Sam Lake is a tremendous writer but Sci-Fi is not his strong side. Thriller/Noir stories are something he really excels at but this second attempt at Sci-Fi just doesn't cut it. The story is boring, the characters are not relatable (I really don't care if someone of them dies and this is always a bad thing). The whole experience is just not memorable. I'm a fan of good quality SCP (X-Files, Stranger Things, etc) but this doesn't even come close. Gameplay-wise the game gets repetitive very quickly. The upgrade tree is very basic and boring, the shooting mechanics are okay and the power feels awesome but that gets very old quickly. Soon after you will see the boring pattern of the gameplay loop. Go there, kill the enemies, claim the control point. Go there, kill the enemies, claim the control point. This is the most painful 4/10 rating I've ever give since I really, really consider myself as a Remedy Entertainment hardcore fan."
3,CaueV,"Sep  3, 2019",1,"Do not bother playing this game.The game does a terrible job at introducing you to its world. it feels like you missed a cut scene or a dialogue for the first hour or 2. And by the end you kind of just accept things.Checkpoints are miles away from your objective.This is particularly infuriating because many enemies can one shot you.It artificially increases the duration of the game by adding absurdly long shooting parts. The ending fights take (I'm no kidding) around 20 minutes each. 20 minutes of literally just shooting at zombies, while all you want is to progress the damn story. And don't you dare die to one of the one shot dudes, or you'll get to fight them again aaaall the way from the beginning.The only reason I kept playing was to ~~unveil the mystery~~. Too bad the ending is just the same non-sense and it was all a waste of time.The gameplay is fun for a while, but these guys should be awarded for not knowing what their game is about. They do everything in their power to take you away from the story line, either by flashing uninteresting side quests on your face, filling the world with ""lore"" collectibles that don't add anything to the story, adding 10 minute long shooting bits or by making you go back to the last checkpoint.Don't even get me started on the terrible waypoint system. Again, don't play the game. It's not worth it. My last couple of hours I was just forcing myself to play it just to see the ending, just to get disappointed once again."
4,Kairax,"Aug 27, 2019",6,"Hey, are you old enough to remember ""Psi-Ops: the mindgate conspiracy"" ? This is new age re-imagining of that game but with flare of SCP, new graphics and blander story. If you are new to games - enjoy destructibility and new way to control environment, you will like it."
5,exeandrey,"Aug 28, 2019",3,"It has some old good Max Pain features like ringing phones that you can pick up, amazing game physics and objects interaction. But the game itself is super boring and repeatative. Scenario makes no sense, some psychodelic crap, with no prestory, no indroduction, same locations and enemies all over again and again. Same rooms, same boring shooting. Thers no fun in shooting enemies: some rainbow stuff instead of blood, and bodies imidiatly disappears. With no explanation at all what is going on. Basicaly script is : BURO (makes no sense), BROTHER, DIRECTOR(makes no sense), HISS (makes no sense). I would put zero or one score if not great furniture shooting. Do not reccomend, if you cant try it for free."
6,Timppa87,"Aug 27, 2019",10,Very high quality action game. Unique story and excellent game mechanics. Beautiful graphics! PC with RTX on is just pure candy for your eyes!
7,Roswell,"Aug 27, 2019",9,"Remedy proves once again that they are one of the best studios in the industry + Great Visuals and Effects+ Immersive Story+ Addictive Game-play+ Soundtrack (and music from Poets of the Fall) Is awesome. - Lip sync and animations in some of the conversations (cut-scenes) are little bit bland, and itsometimes seems that side characters are much better looking than the main character."
8,Duppaduu12,"Aug 27, 2019",10,Game is awesome! Is mysterious triller like Alan Wake but even better. Best game of year 2019 so far.Just buy it.
9,Tidytib,"Aug 28, 2019",4,This Nvidia RTX Tech demo could be an excellent game. Shooting furniture is fun for only a little while.
10,tomppa500,"Aug 27, 2019",10,"The game graphics were pleasant and delightful. The story was weird  even so made me laugh many times. Unlike Remedy's previous games, Control is open-world game and i think Remedy made it work well!"
11,nurii29,"Feb 13, 2021",0,its bored me to death i dont give any little **** about storty wtf is this gameplay i would excuse it if this garbage came out 2010 **** this
12,NothingisTrue,"Nov 20, 2020",7,"Not my favorite, but solid effort from Remedy. Hopefully Alan Wake 2 is next."
13,TitaniumDragon,"Mar 15, 2021",8,"Control is a third-person story-heavy metroidvania action game that draws obvious inspiration from the stories of the SCP Foundation – which itself took inspiration from various secretive government agencies containing the paranormal, like the MIB. As a fan of SCPs, I was excited to see other groups play around with this idea, as it is one that is very ripe for exploration. Here, the main “feature” is that a lot of the “Altered Items” are, rather than being fantastic things, instead extremely mundane. The central premise is that something is granting seemingly ordinary objects extraordinary power (possibly the collective belief of humanity in these icons), and they do various fantastical things as a result. The mixture of the mundane and the fantastic works quite well; when you see a rubber duck in a cage behind a thick sheet of glass, you know that it is dangerous, despite its innocuous nature. You play as Jesse Faden, a young woman who is looking for her brother, who was taken by the Federal Bureau of Control years earlier. As the game unfolds, you learn that she and her brother were involved in some sort of Altered World Event, where a seemingly innocent item created major problems, and in the process of the event, the pair of them gained extraordinary powers. Jesse’s main ability is to bind herself to Objects of Power – a particular type of Altered Item that grant paranatural abilities to those who build some sort of connection to them. These abilities range from hovering in the air to telekinetically throwing objects to making a shield of stone around yourself. And it’s a good thing she has these abilities, because she walks into the Bureau of Control while it is in a crisis. The bureau is located in the Oldest House, an imposing building that hides itself from the eyes of normal men, and whose insides are constantly shifting and changing, and it is under lockdown – some sort of horrible otherworldly thing, called the Hiss, has entered it, and taken a bunch of agents under its control. Jesse, blind to all of this, walks straight into the Director’s office – ordinarily impossible due to security, but instead all too easy because of the devastation wrought by the Hiss – and finds him dead on his desk, his weapon – the Service Weapon, an object of power that looks like a gun that identifies you as the Director of the Bureau – right next to him. Naturally, she binds herself to it, and in the process realizes that this is far, far bigger than her search for the brother – and that the Bureau needs her. This is a really neat premise for the game, and as you go through the game, you gradually uncover the history of the Bureau. In truth, the Bureau’s background is really the main thing that makes this game work – reading about all the events and altered items, then dealing with the various issues they’re causing, works really well. These are often rather funny, but in a rather dark sort of way, and the contrast of the mundane-seeming items and the mundanity of government work is contrasted with the ridiculousness of the items they’re trying to contain and the danger that they represent. Pretty much everything about this is fun, but sadly, the rest of the game doesn’t quite hold up to it. The combat is only okay. For being as fantastical as it is in some ways, virtually everything you fight is some variation on “dude with gun” or “dude with telekinetic powers who chucks stuff at you”, along with a couple melee enemies. There’s really not that much variety in terms of what you’re facing, and as a result, you will spend the whole game doing more or less the same thing in combat – even more so as you get your best power, telekinesis, very early. The game’s dearth of bosses also hurts it – there’s really only three bosses that aren’t some variant of “dude with gun” (though one “dude with gun” boss does have a nice array of powers), and so, despite the seemingly fantastic setting, there’s really not that much fantastic about the combat. In a game that is 20+ hours long, that is far too little variety. The game also suffers from its Metroidvania aspects. The problem with Metroidvanias is that they encourage backtracking, but backtracking through the Bureau isn’t much fun – the main fun of the game is discovering new things, and this is pretty boring. The sidequests, too, are a mixed bag; some of them are nothing but filler, while others are some of the best content in the game, including several of the more interesting bosses. Finally, the game’s ending is quite lackluster. There is no final boss and you are left with a number of dangling plot points – and while that’s not entirely a bad thing it still feels unsatisfying in many ways. All in all, Control is a game that I was very enthusiastic to play, and felt great about playing for about 3/4ths of it, but was good but not great in the end."
14,darioxlz,"Jan 17, 2020",8,"Excellent game, good story although it is easy to get lost on the map and not achieve the objectives easily, after finishing the game I did not want to continue doing the secondary missions because I got bored"
15,GoodGames99,"May  1, 2021",10,"Not best from Remedy, but still solid game and i love connection with one of my favorite games ""Alan Wake"". Bonus points for good looking main character."
16,AkuAku,"Oct  3, 2019",6,"The first time you start to play you like everything. Everything is interesting, mystic, there is a lot of things to do, places to be, stuff to shoot, things to read, etc. Then, after an hour or two, game starts to feel empty. Same level design, same enemies, same missions. All those cryptic messages pile up and you get tired of reading them. Most of them are ""we saw {data deleted}. it is now contained inside The Bureau."" And most of all - there is not a lot of story, and almost no characters. Almost nothing is happening. And all you do is shoot same enemies with the same boring gun, grind for rediculous and very boring crafting mechanic, and blindly follow where people tell you to go."
17,nitorita,"Jun 23, 2020",6,"Unlike its predecessor Quantum Break, Control suffers from a story that is confusing and uninteresting. It tries to attract your interest, but fails to do so as it tries to push a ton of lore onto you without providing any context. Since you don't know what's going on, you're forced to play along with it in hopes that you will eventually figure it out. Lacking an introduction, you're thrown straight inside a random building that doesn't have much in the way of exploration, and it's hard to ever justify doing so because the environment doesn't seem all that interesting. There are collectibles for you to find, but they don't provide anything meaningful besides inconsequential lore. A lot of the time as you're progressing through, you will get lost and not know what to do because the game takes a bit of a hands-off approach. Checkpoints don't really exist in the game, so even though the game isn't particularly difficult, it can be annoying at times to have to start over in a region if you die. I admire that Control got telekinesis done right unlike other games in the past that tried to incorporate it, but that alone doesn't save the game from its faults. The game is formulaic as well, since you simply enter a room, fight the enemies inside, and then enter the next one and rinse and repeat. There's nothing else to do outside of fighting besides going through required cutscenes or events. Overall, you won't miss out on much by not playing this game. This is another one of those shooters that'll eventually get tossed into the bargain bin and become forgotten. It's bland, lacks direction, and never tries to get you to care about the world and its characters. It's not very lengthy either since you can get it done in around eight hours. I'd say that Control is worth a 6.5, but I settled on a 6 because of its repetitive gameplay and lazy writing. (On a side note, Control suffers from a known issue where if your GPU is overclocked, it can error out and freeze. If you experience this, turn off any GPU overclocking and it should run fine.)"
18,pongkrit03,"Apr 16, 2020",4,"Definitely overhyped. I don't know why the critics gave very high score. I bought the game expecting very awesome experience, stunning graphic, but it is not the case at all. First, the game drains a lot of your GPU but only has mediocre graphic and poor environment. Nothing looks beautiful here because you are always in the building. The game extremely wants players to use RTX for Ray tracing, It has too much different, like you won't be able to see through mirror without Ray tracing. However, even with tracing, the environment still felt bland and uninteresting. Action is ok for the most part but the worst here is the Story. You don't know what you are doing and where you are going and enemies are just respawned out of nowhere and have boring same looks as well. The building felt like maze, then you are teleported to some another bland demension, once you clear obj then teleported back in the bulid, then after move from room to room, kill some repeptitive enemies, again teleported repeat cycle. Map design is very confused and hard to navigate in menu too. All in all, I tried to like it, but I couldn't. Playing it for 5 hrs then gave up. I couldn't tolerate myself any further. Don't buy this game, It is not worth it even with the 70% sale !! just don't."
19,MeritCoba,"Jun  4, 2020",4,"I didn't want to score this game at all but I had to, to write these comments. Why? Because I returned the game after playing an hour to get a refund. The main reason I returned the game was that I could not connect to the protagonist and the story.  I thought I was mistaken about it so I read a few reviews and finally read a summary of the plot. It just confirmed that it was a poorly written story. First let me talk about the protagonist: Jesse.Normally when you play a game you identify with the main character.  Mass Effect springs to mind. This often means that you know what she knows. Of course, this is not always the case, but it is usual so when things are important to the story. However, in this game it is clear that the protagonist knows things that you do not know  and which are vital to the story and you do not get informed about them in a straight manner.  Why are you in that building? What is your motivation? You get only told in bits and pieces. Some games do that too, but often supply a reason: the main character has lost her memory or is otherwise unable to recall everything correctly. Some games and movies make that into a story feature: it is called the unreliable narrator. Here it is simply: you do not get told for no other reason than we want to keep things mysterious for the player. As such there is an immediate disconnect between you and the main character. Now couple this to the poor story development. You wander through the halls of this empty building that has obvious been invaded by some hostile force. It screams that fact from the security screens in the first security room near the entrance. I found this well done... until I ran into the janitor. Did he not notice the alarms? Did he not notice the scattered briefcases in the corridor? But Jesse just shrugs him off as someone she likes, even though she says that he is a good candidate for an axe-murderer.The deeper you go into the building the weirder things become. And the more I wondered why she was going into that building unarmed and lacking any kind of protection and with a likely chance that both the invaders and security will see her as an unfriendly?Jesse's actions get hardly explained. In fact we get hardly explained who Jesse actually is or why we should care for her. There is nothing that springs to mind about her but that she has voices in her head and is looking for her brother. She is almost no personality. Is she worried? Scared? Is she determined? Is she adventurous? Is she a journalist? Is she married? Nothing. The poor writing starts to show up everywhere. There are for instance the documents that you can collect which are mostly filled with bureaucratic clap trap that is obviously there for laughs. It is  a strange dissonance with the overall mood. It is like making slapstick jokes in a serious horror.Even worse: things get explained in notes. Like what hiss adversaries are. It is told as a found documentary. Where did this come from? How did they know?The adversaries feel like apparitions: they  teleport in and after you killed them they fall apart in dust that blows away.Then at some point Jesse meets a bureau official who doesn't ask who she is, what she is doing in the building, assumes she is friendly and instantly remembers an event that happened seventeen years ago that  Jesse is asking her about without even looking up things.It feels like this is some kind of dream or illusion, but it never plays that twist when i finally researched what the plot was.  Oh an it all gets explained with referring to Jungian psychology.You saw that connection too. Of course you did.. So let me throw in another concept. The story is obviously inspired by the ideas of Tacitus, the  foremost chronologist of  the history of the first century of the Roman Empire. His central theme: a dominant central power corrupts everything it touches is evident in the game. It leads to chaos, infighting and the defeat of its ultimate goal: stability. It descends into the chaos brought on by internal strife until finally control is established and peace returns. And this is more proof of the game being based on Tacitus' ideas than any of the reviews provide proof for a Jungian inspiration.That is control for you: lacking a clear  and well written story you can just say anything to make yourself seem smart knowing that few people will correct you out of fear to look dumb.Of course you can always say: that because you, Merit, don't understand it, doesn't mean it is poorly written or not Jungian. Providing some proof for you claims would go a long way. So let's apply Ockham's razor here: there it the possibility that this is a well written story that works in various aspects of  Jungian psychology, or it is just a poorly written story that was needed to give the game some background.  Seems the latter is the more likely."
20,Hack,"Dec 24, 2019",7,"I just finished it and overall I enjoyed it, but it wasn't without issues. I feel like the game starts off really strong but ends rather weak, by the end I was ready for it to be over, it definitely overstayed its welcome. Certain scenes just dragged on, or maybe they just felt like they did because I was getting bored by the end. + Visuals+ Combat+ Voicework - Performance (I had to turn down/off far too many settings to keep 60+ fps with a GTX 1080, 8600k @ 4.8GHz at only 1080p)- Confusing map, maybe it's just me but I got lost a lot- Unsatisfactory ending-Overstayed its welcome"
21,a_wild_dandan,"Jun  6, 2020",4,"Control does 'moody atmosphere' exceptionally well and fails at nearly everything else. The majority of the game's locations look identical, making navigation confusing and boring. The map menu is nearly useless for aiding navigation. It desperately needs a 3D view for a world with such verticality. Doom (2016) did this perfectly. Enemies are also homogeneous. As you explore and retread the map, you'll waste hours grinding through the same predictably respawning hordes of junk. (Or, like me, you just give up and start running past them. They'll keep returning no matter what you do anyway. Why bother?) The gameplay loop is aggressively tedious: go here, liberate the control point of samey enemies, and watch a few lines of dialogue. Ad nauseum. There are occasionally puzzles to refreshingly break up the monotony. It isn't nearly enough to offset the overwhelming drudgery. The boss battles are far too difficult and acutely frustrating. Worse, there are no checkpoints before the fights. Upon death, you get to trudge from your last safe zone to the battle, sit through the same dialogue sequences, and twiddle the same knobs to trigger the fight. Over. And over. And over. This is what ultimately led me to cut my losses and uninstall the game. Control would've scored several points higher if it simply had no boss battles at all. The graphics (maxed) are surprisingly bad. Textures are often blurry and characters look like mannequins. Despite this, my 2080Ti struggled in various locations. I have little sympathy for games which both look bad *and* perform poorly. The in-game media is delightfully reminiscent of Alan Wake. You'll find scores of live actor video films, memos, and audio recordings. Unfortunately, most of the reading is light on world building and mostly filled with monster-of-the-week fluff analogous to X-files episodes or SCP stories. Which gets tedious. Are you seeing the pattern here? The map is tedious, the enemies are tedious, the gameplay loop is tedious, boss fights are tedious, the lore is tedious...The mysterious, eerie world can only hold one's attention for so long when everything else is pure tedium."
22,muzmuz,"Sep  4, 2019",6,"Control is a graphically astonishing third person shooter tackling on a different theme/setting. It offers a satisfying combat, a unique core mechanic and a lot of visual/auditory pleasure. Unfortunately, the seemingly nonsensical story, repetitive environments and bland acting kills it for me."
23,Galaxian,"Jan  1, 2020",5,"I stopped playing the game to create a metacritic account and review this mediocre game. The game is very tiring. The boss fights are difficult and not satisfyingly difficult. The checkpoint system makes you fight spawning enemies every time you die and make your way to the boss fight. This gets very tiring and is a pure waste of time. The level design is impressive at times, but you're so tired from seeing the same places all the time (because you die in vain) that it loses its charm. There are good elements in the game. Like the powers that you have and are impressive and fun to use. Like the story that is intriguing (although way too much on the supernatural side), but these elements do not make the game enjoyable in the end. I'm struggling to finish the game. I really want to give the game a good rating but it became so tiring with all the bad design choices that prohibits me from doing that. Only recommended in a heavy sale (like 5 euros)."
24,BFM,"Apr  5, 2020",3,"Remedy, the Studio behind the ground breaking Max Payne 2, has forgotten how to make a PC game.The bad framerate, the forced motion blur, the lack of MSAA, the bad translation of console controls to keyboard & mouse. The graphics are horrible, as everything got a grainy, fuzzy, grizzle, that changes with every camera move. I guess this is ok for console players who sit far away from their TV, but on PC, this is just butt ugly. And the gameplay itself ... is okay.The system of having just one weapon and selecting transformations to switch between isn't fun,but you spend 90% if the game throwing rocks into enemies anyways.The enemies are all pretty boring and generic, and they respawn all the time. The world itself is a rather boring, sometimes cool building that you never leave.It's all very clinical uninspired, but it works.The decision to make this game non-linear was the biggest mistake, as the developer jumps on the overrated and over-done metroid-vania bandwagon, to sacrifice good level design for the sake of backtracking. The bad map system doesn't help.Some boss fights are good, but the final part of the game seems like it was developed 1 week before the game was finished.(Not that you would care about the unappealing characters in this game anyways, starting with Jesse herself.) Unless you are a hardcore metrod-vania fan, you will find yourself rooting for the game to finally be over. You just want to be done, so you can uninstall it forever .If you are a fan of Max Payne 1 and 2, I am sorry to say that the Remedy that mode those masterpieces is dead now."
25,SirFaulty,"Mar 22, 2020",3,"Typical Remedy rubbish, at this point I still don't know why I continue to support their games. The story is absolute trash, the combat is incredibly frustrating, especially with all the bloody cool downs(from weapons to powers), yet enemies seem to be able to spam combat actions repeatedly which often results in a lot, and I mean a lot, of trial and error gameplay. The artificial difficulty is further inflated by the terribly designed boss fights that are so cheap you will be clawing the walls with no nails left on your fingers the nearer the end you get because there is nothing skillful required here as the game throws hordes and hordes of frustratingly difficult enemies at you all at once which will test the patience of every normal gamer out there who isn't trying to prove he/she is god's glorious gift to gaming. The game simply becomes one of attrition the further into it you get and that is not my idea of fun, at all! It is also coupled with one of the most infuriating maps I have seen in a long time. So much time is wasted trying to get around its serpentine labyrinthe of a map because you have no objective markers to help you along the way. While I get some may enjoy this, I find it frustrating as I don't play games in one weekend like some people. My gaming window, because I am a working adult , is small. Leave the game unplayed for a few days or weeks and you will be totally lost when it comes to the map and remembering where things are. Not that that should be the biggest of your worries because the game will annoy you so much that you won't want to touch it for weeks. I installed this  7 months ago and I literally play 15 min of it before I can't take anymore of it. Sadly when I start something I have to see it to the end, so at this point it's just that compulsion that is driving me forward not because I am invested in the character, the world or the game at all. F**k Remedy and f**k this **** game. I am out. No more of your horribly designed crap will clog my systems going forward no matter how good it looks on the outside. I am giving it a 3 because it looks relatively good on PC and plays very smoothly but that is the only pro."
26,Aim45,"Apr 17, 2020",2,"Overrated, Overhyped, Boring, Tedious, Frustrating, Repetitive -> just some words to describe this crap The first hours of the game are ok-ish, the story starts with lots of mystery, but it gets repetitive very very quickly. The story is interesting, in the beginning at least, but the mystery never unfolds! It gets more and more mysterious, confusing and you'll just lose interest eventually, because it really gets stupid and ridiculous after a while. The writer really tried too hard with it, he just wanted to put more and more mystery into it to make it more interesting, but he pretty much failed to make it so. The entire game is so **** repetitive. There are different sections and you will unlock them by progressing through the game, BUT they all look the same. The level design is one of the worst things, it super, super repetitive. Also, you will be backtracking ALOT, as if it's not enough that the level design is repetitive, you'll go through the same rooms over and over again. Next, the navigation: BLEAH, this is really the worst navigation i've seen in any game, like ever. Sometimes, it is so hard to find out through which narrow corridor you have to go to get somewhere, many times you'll teleport right near the objective, but because of a wall or some stupid crap you'll have to go round the entire map to get there. Really, why do they have to do this?!?! Why do they have to make you go round a **** map to get to the objective which is a few meters from you, but cannot get there because of a window, wall or some other stupid **** You'll end up looking on youtube to see where to go and which direction you have to take, but even on youtube, the guys who are recording the walkthrough are searching for the direction, room, the narrow corridor or a **** lift to get to the objective. It's like Remedy deliberately made this game super frustrating to navigate around. Next, CHEAP DEATHS: yes, the game itself is pretty easy when you're fighting regular enemies, but when you have to fight a boss, it gets reaaaaly frustrating, painfully difficult, and you'll die, ALOT. They are super unpredictable and you'll die in one shot or so. It is just stupid, they tried too hard to make it challenging and as a result, they filled it with super cheap deaths. The characters, same as with the story, dull and uninteresting, this jesse faden is one of the most uninteresting main characters i've ever seen. The rest of them were so boring that they were super forgettable, i cannot think about any other character in the game, other than that stupid Emily Pope. I just finished the quest ""The Face of the Enemy"" but really, i completely stopped caring about it, the game got so boring that i just couldn't bring myself to finish it, i just uninstalled it because it got so boring, tedious and repetitive. I really wanted to like this game, but i just cannot see why it is so highly rated, it's absolutely NOTHING special, it really doesn't deserve a full price. I think it's pretty clear that Remedy paid to have good reviews for it, otherwise the game would've gotten just 5-6 on average. I wouldn't be surprised if the good user reviews on this platforms are written by Remedy staff."
27,Ingepunk,"Sep  1, 2019",6,"In English:What should I say about this mediocre game, now let's start with the story.It's about something that has infected a building. Why, you do not know! Now Jessie Faden goes in there to ... look for the brother and becomes the director of the building because they find a ""living weapon"".Graphics: Northlight Engine, as in Quantum Break very mediocre. Owners of an RT graphics card can be happy otherwise the graphic does not tear anybody off the stool.Sound: In German the purest catastrophe, In English good.Gameplay: Here comes the biggest weakness of Control to wear.At first it is entertaining enough to chase after the mysterious story, but after about 5 ~ 6 hours the game does not even know where to lead it. I like games with a tick challenge, but Control leaves you completely in the lurch.Even sidequests take you on an endless journey, because you're not strong enough to get any further or you're lacking in certain skills, but where do other side quests make you end up?This Metroidvania concept annoys without end!It is indecisive, illogical and makes quite a good game concept completely broken.Even the gunplay in the often too narrow spaces is more difficult than funny, right when you get 5 rockets at once in the face. The super powers help there just as much as Pooping, namely not at all. My conclusion 6/10It could have been such a good game from Control, but no, it had to be different (do not mind) just so different that it just becomes unpleasant after 6 to 7 hours. One tortures himself mainly by having fun instead of having fun. In Deutsch:Was soll ich zu diesem Mittelmäßigen Spiel sagen, nun fangen wir bei der Story an.Es geht um etwas das ein Gebäude Infiziert hat. Warum, weiß man nicht! Nun geht man als Jessie Faden dort rein um...den Bruder zu suchen und wird zur Direktorin des Gebäudes weil man eine ""lebendige Waffe"" findet.Grafik: Northlight Engine, wie bei Quantum Break sehr Mittelmäßig. Besitzer einer RT Grafikkarte können sich freuen sonst reißt die Grafik niemanden vom Hocker.Sound: Auf Deutsch die reinste Katastrophe, In English gut.Gameplay: Hier kommt die größte Schwäche von Control zum tragen.Anfangs ist es noch ganz Unterhaltsam der mysteriösen Story nachzujagen, nach etwa 5~6 Stunden weiß aber nicht mal mehr das Spiel selbst wohin es lotsen soll. Ich mag ja Spiele mit einem Tick herausforderung aber Control lässt dich völlig im Stich.Sogar Sidequests nehmen einen mit ohne ein Ende zu finden weil, du bist längst nicht Stark genug um da weiter zu kommen oder dir fehlt es an bestimmten Fähigkeiten, aber woher nehmen wenn selbst wieder andere Sidequests dich nicht zum Ende kommen lassen?Dieses Metroidvania Konzept nervt ohne Ende!Es ist unschlüssig, unlogisch und mach ein recht gutes Spielkonzept völlig kaputt.Selbst das Gunplay in den oftmals viel zu engen Räumen ist eher Anstrengent als lustig, erstrecht wenn man 5 Raketen auf einmal ins Gesicht bekommt. Die Superkräfte helfen da genausoviel wie Pupsen, nämlich gar nicht. Mein Fazit 6/10Man hätte so ein gutes Spiel aus Control machen können, aber nein, es musste ja anders sein (nichts dagegen) nur so anders das es nach 6 bis 7 Stunden einfach unlustig wird. Man Quält sich hauptsächlich durch statt Spaß am Spiel zu haben."
28,OverWind,"Sep 16, 2019",5,"Decent enough game, but not the 10/10 a lot of magazines claim it is. The setting is really bland (anonymous offices, which is basically pretty much the whole game).The enemies get's boring as well. Yawn."
29,Lamp,"Aug 29, 2019",7,"Pros: Lack of quest markers, fairly clean HUD, serviceable combat, ok level design, light horror atmosphere, decent pacing, wide field of view when not aiming, high production values, gameplay customization options like enemy health bars on / offCons: Kind of boring, map only gives position of named locations so traversing can be a chore Overall you'll just be shooting things"
30,Drcuck,"Sep 28, 2019",3,"Very disappointing. Awful, poorly voice acted dialogue. Poorly synced facial animations. The combat system is satisfying at first, but becomes repetitive and boring. If you aren’t fighting boring mobs of enemies using the game’s boring combat system, you’re running around trying to find the entrance to an area you haven’t reached yet, which the map does a terrible job of helping you find. The music is as cookie-cutter as it gets - the “action” music is all the same, nothing but “intense” drumming - and my god the one metal track written for this game is horrendous (seriously, what were they thinking?). The story is cliched and uninspired, fed to you through mind-numbing expository cut-scenes, audio recordings (which can’t be listened to while running around, for some reason), and WAY too many notes, and the characters are one-dimensional and groan-inducing. The graphics and especially the destructible environment physics are nice, but they serve little more function than to polish a turd. Unbelievably overrated, unfun, waste of time and money that has little to no replay value even if I wanted to continue playing it."
31,czg,"Jan  1, 2020",5,"Visuals are very nice. Architecture is cool. Backstory and world are interesting, though the creepypasta vibe and the main character's cliche inner monologue wears thin after a while. On the negative side, the gameplay is more of an obstacle than a boon. Difficulty curve is unenjoyably punishing and the gameplay is too slow for the dozen-or-more retries a boss battle takes. After each death, I have to start again from a save point miles back and navigate the map to the boss fight to be killed again, rinse and repeat ad nauseam.I work on games for a living and I don't have the time for this. Would ask the devs to add difficulty settings to the game; if not, I'd ask for a refund if I could."
32,NoCashLeft,"Jan  1, 2020",5,"A mediocre game that won game of the year 2019 by IGN. What a joke.  According to IGN, this game beats Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Resident Evil 2 Remake and Disco Elysium, can't believe it. Control is in most aspects a worse game than the other title by Remedy - Quantum Break. As with Quantum Break the player obtains special powers that spice up the combat. Control has smoother game play with less stutter issues. This is the only advantage against Quantum Break. Control has a more boring story, a lot more difficult combat, a lot less diverse environments and it uses the same uninspiring engine, Northlight, which has water washed colors but at least Control does not freeze or stutter like Quantum Break.  The sound effects are acceptable except for the annoying voices in the head of the protagonist (don't use headphones unless you want to go mad). The story progresses through obtaining pieces of information but it is constructed in a rather boring way. The game play is repetitive and boring. Wait for a sale, rent or borrow from a friend. Not worth the current price tag."
33,Thegm963,"Aug 29, 2019",5,"Lets begin by saying that this game is a massive resource hog with my 1080 barely being able to keep up, and that at 60fps. To make matters worse, this does not translate to visual fidelity, not only the setting is a by 70-80% a very bland set of offices and gray corridors, the rest looks outdated too. Like, trees/plants/foliage don't even animate, what year is it? The story is cool, though rather predictable, which is a shame because the overall setting and mood would make an amazing stage for a kickass story with plot twists, mysteries and stuff. Oh well. Unfortunately, the game also suffers from a Dark Souls complex to put it this way, which is extremely annoying to see in more and more games. You unlock checkpoints as the game goes on, you can only level up/upgrade stuff to them, you can teleport between them and when you die, you return to them with some ending up being annoyingly far away from where you died. Oh, and most enemies respawn as well! To add insult to injury, loading times are probably the longest I have seen since a long time, I would pick up my phone and chat when they d pop up. And they do pop up a lot. Wanna save some time and fast travel to a point nearby in the same level? Better go pee or eat something because it's loading time! Overall, a very meh game. Not great, not terrible. Maybe if it was on Steam and it would go on some decent sale..."
34,dyeah,"Apr 14, 2020",2,"A great story and game totally ruined by absurd difficulty spikes and terribly placed save points.  Battles can last  several minutes and finish with you getting instakilled by a single lucky shot by one Hiss enemy. Most of the time it is not even clear how you die because of the saturated red screen.  So sad to see a great concept and world ruined by the ""try-hard"" crap design. Fail."
35,dr_yev,"Sep  9, 2019",4,"Control does not come close to living up to the hype.  It was supposed to be a mindbending experience in a fascinating setting.  Instead, we get a slightly non-linear arcade shooter in a drab brutalist building.  The setting is stylistically interesting for the first hour but then it becomes clear that, aside from brief interludes, we are to return to the same stereotypical government building over and over.  The map is just awful and should have been three dimensional. The storytelling is just weird.  The ""insight"" into the protagonist's thoughts is unnecessary and could have been accomplished by more expressive facial animations.  The endless notes and memos provide little background and get old quickly.  I'm usually all for reading this kind of thing but I have been just skimming them for clues lately.  I am yet to come across something that is a clear Alan Wake reference but I played Alan Wake nearly 10 years and many games ago.  Who has the time to pay that much attention to boring text notes? The combat is repetitive and each new iteration of the service weapon or new power adds little to the gameplay.  It is launch-headshot-rinse-repeat action at its core.  It is similar to the earlier games in the mass effect series combat without improvement.  Jesse can't figure out how to crouch behind cover?  There are also some rather cheap mechanics that allow the ai to turn the tide of battle and, before you know it, you respawn at one of the sparsely-placed checkpoints and have to run half a mile to get to the action.  It is not difficult, it is annoying.  The combat is not unenjoyable but I find that I get bored after about an hour of playing. Now, the elephant in the room:  the real-time ray tracing.  It's pretty, sure.  But, you really have to pause and look for it to notice it; it matters little during combat.  I'm yet to play this game on a 4 k display for which I will most likely have to turn RTX off, I suspect that it may look better with a higher resolution and no ray tracing. I got this game for free with my computer so I guess I cannot complain much.  I would have been pissed off had I bought it."
36,Ivan,"Sep  9, 2019",5,I was excited to buy this game after reading so many positive reviews. What a disappointment!!! After three hours of play I can say that I have understood nothing or almost nothing in history.The beautiful graphics are not enough. The variety of settings is nothing. The gameplay is fun but not enough to save the game. I really love complex and intricate stories but this just doesn't involve me. Sin
37,Faunymaroo,"Sep 27, 2019",2,"Incredibly bland, **** game with piss-poor fps mechanics, an incomprehensible narrative and a nod to something better with limited telekinesis and flying that barely introduces anything different. A step back for the studio. At least stick bullet time in, blimey. I replayed the original Max Payne afterwards as a palette cleanser - so so much better. Colossal disappointment."
38,Kekkone,"Aug 28, 2019",5,"This game is beautiful if you have the hardware to run it. Too bad you spend your time inside a restricted grayish-blueish facility. However, when you get some variation to that, it's always awesome. I'd say this game's strongest points are artistic and mysterious level design at least in some parts, sound design and overall graphics and effects. Controls are adequate but a bit clunky. In the end, however, it's just another Remedy games with recurring Remedy problems: +First: very low or zero replayability (well, death rally had replayability for sure, but the games after that didn't, except maybe Max Payne for some nostalgia). Once you have completed this game, you can practically just sell it. Quantum Break theoretically had replayability, but the game was so painful that I don't really want to do it again just to see the movie clips. +Second: linearity. You are just running from place to another in a restricted area. +Third: recycled ideas. The ability to manipulate environment has been around since Max Payne. In the later games this same concept is just reused in a slightly different ways. Sure it looks cool and is fun for awhile, but it gets very soon repetitive and can't carry the whole game. +Fourth: exclusivity to stores no one wants to use. +Fifth: boss fights. +Sixth: average storyline. +Seventh: performance issues on PC. +Eighth: Forced over-the-shoulder mode with no possibility to go first person. Also no stealth. All fights are practically shoot & hide. Btw. if you didn't notice it already, 90% of the 10/10 reviews seem to be user score manipulation. Lots of accounts have been created just to give full score to this game."
39,sldbd,"Aug 30, 2019",9,"Short: In my opinion Control can be a real piece of Art, if you are into these kind of Games. It manages to balance story and gameplay just right for its purposes and delivers a truly immersive experience, if you can attach yourself to its genre. If not leave it or refund it. its one of those games that you either love or hate, i believe. In either case a 6.6 at the time of writing doesnt do it justice. its a well executed concept, although its hungry and will make your rig sweat. in Detail: Control is a Game with a weird Story. For the better part of your playthrough it will be confusing and thats what is was deliberately made to be. The plot line, the ever-shifting environment, the lack of evident explanation or guidance. Slowly you will learn more about the Bureau, your Characters purpose, motives and origin and what the **** is happening in this odd place. The Gameplay is enjoyable but not strong enough to carry the game, if youre not bringing an affinity for the Genre (Soft Sci-fi/Mystery). The telekinesis abilities remind me a lot of force unleashed just with a better physics engine. After completing the main plot I for my part am still fascinated by them, mainly because the more you progress the better you can rely on them. I rarely use the Gun anymore. The Gunplay is only on average maybe below, but thats not the reason im into this game. The bosses can be challenging when underestimated, but thats no competition to real boss fights, like in for example soulsbourne games. The Enemies are repetitive, but everything else wouldnt be story cohesive. The Atmosphere created is absolutely great, although from what i read you will need to have pretty good specs to fully taste how this game is meant to be played. I played it maxed out on 2k and found that through the exceptional use of lightning (even without ray tracing), particles, detailed mapdesign and physics i could really immerse myself into the environment. Additionally there has been put great effort into writing all those memos/audio tapes/Clips, that can be discovered around the map. In most games you get the feeling those were just placed as random fillers and didnt get much attention in the development process. Here they are mostly entertaining in addition of being a crucial part in understanding the story as a whole piece by piece a little bit better. What i dont get about reviewers ranting on this game, is the fact, that they are obviously not the targeted group of gamers this game was developed/written for. If youre not into exploration dont buy subnautica, if youre not into blunt Shooters dont buy DOOM, if youre not into story driven games and/or mystery as a genre dont buy Control.Remedy games have pretty much always been strongly story focused. Alan Wake, Quantum Break, Max Payne relied for the most part on an immersive Story. Those Games are ""one time playthroughs"" and thats it and only as that they deserve to be judged. At least in my opinion. A product is not to be judged as what you want or expect it to be, but what it was meant to be. You dont go into a Starbucks ordering coffee, only to go on a rant on how **** this kebab tastes."
40,Ekko,"Aug 27, 2019",8,"This is an atmospheric game. It's a looker and a sounder (the ambience is beautiful, sound, music cues, it's just spot on). While I personally never found any character in Remedy games more likable than Mr. Wake, I don't feel bugged by Jesse. Not as much as by almost the entire Quantum-Break-cast which just oozed Hollywood-by-numbers. An intricate web of information and details is woven. The narrative feels right. Timing wise, content wise. It's presented beautifully. There's a certain colour curve and grain over everything, that lends itself fittingly to the 60-70's-ish interior and feel of the Bureau. Gunplay feels quick and responsive, there's lots of physical game mechanics that are rally fun to learn and use. Feels very potent. Highly recommended. Get on it, you."
41,FTWOblivion,"Jun 27, 2020",10,Fantastic Sci-Fi mindbender. My personal GOTY. Give it a shot. I don't think you will regret it if your computer can run it. Good luck Director.
42,dave1505,"Sep  7, 2019",4,"Sure it has graphics, but if what you make is nothing but a pretty picture than you'd get better off making drawings or paintings or take a digital design course, not making videogames. It's just another bland game that falls in the graphics-but-expect-nothing-more trend. The characters' motivations, personalities and actions are never explained, so I guess you're just supposed to have a wtf face the entire time while trying to make sense of their barely related words within their sentences. That's the story, the gameplay is just repetitive shooting at enemies that either swarm you from a direction or from every direction, so press the ""shoot"" and occasionally the telekinesis buttons and hope to not randomly get insta killed."
43,ecimir,"Sep 18, 2019",6,Interesting and unique gameplay and world but it quickly gets boring. Not to mention pefromance issues.
44,Chaython,"Sep  8, 2019",5,"I appreciate the implementation of Ray Tracing and physics.The superpowers are ""fun"" but repetitive.The map however is very confusing.The lore is uninteresting, the story is campy, the acting and facial animations are bad. cut scenes have terrible camera angles that it randomly jumps between because the scenes are just talking...The AI is bad, flying enemies cannot float below a certain height, enemies often can't come up stairs...Enemies do high damage and they throw 10 at you at once, to overwhelm you rather than giving them any logic. n most rooms there's an area you can defend without the enemies being able to hit you."
45,MCmetacritic,"Nov 18, 2020",0,"Never before has such lazy writing been delivered in the form of such mediocre voice acting.

46,Pier,"Oct 29, 2019",6,"It's amazing the first 2-3 hours and then it becomes super repetitive and the writing just falls apart. Also, considering it's a game about moving a round a massive building, the map you use is quite frankly terrible."

48,Renaigse,"Jan  9, 2020",4,"Сюжет игры изначально подается откровенно плохо, ты совершенно не понимаешь,что происходит, затем приходит почти полное осознание происходящего, но это вовсе не значит, что ты остаешься этим доволен. Сюжет пытается казаться небанальным, уникальным и ""нидлявсех"", однако это совершенно не так) Концовка вообще слита в труху. Геймплей   по началу кажется неплохим, он в принципе такой и есть, однако приедается уже к середине игры, ты пользуешься максимум 2 приемами, стрельба всратая, под конец старался не стрелять по возможности, а просто метать объекты во врагов. Противники ведут себя странно, то стоят как вкопанные и даже не стреляют, то стремительно тебя рашат, причем это вообще не имеет никакой логики. Видов врагов всего где-то 5-6, по ощущениям 2-3 ( Джаггернаут, летающие челы, и дефолтные нелетающие челы). Игра очень монотонна, одинаковое окружение, одинаковые действия ( приходишь куда-либо, убиваешь толпу врагов,ищешь бессмысленные, ни капли не раскрывающие лор записки, смотришь катсцену/ведешь диалог с персонажем). Прокачка персонажа убога, просто повышение стат, диалоги убоги и непонятны, состоят в основном из обсуждения псевдонаучных терминов и явлений, в которые невозможно поверить, оружия мало, хоть и дизайн великолепный, персонажи максимально неинтересные, к ним не привязываешься ни капли, музыкальное сопровождение битв раздражает, помимо битв его будто бы вообще нет, единственный момент, когда музыка в игре хорошая - это миссия с лабиринтом, длительностью 2-3 минуты, дополнительные квесты крайне примитивны( сходи убей), за исключением нескольких квестов в конце которых нужно победить босса, кстати о боссах, в основной сюжетке их нет совсем,только в доп миссиях. Плюсы у игры, конечно же, тоже имеются, это прекрасная графика, детализация предметов выполнена отлично, с RTX картинка становится просто конфеткой, некоторые локации, в частности лабиринт и отель, выполнены выше всяких похвал, гг не бесит, порой даже вызывает симпатию, дизайн пушек действительно уникальный и выглядит классно, физика окружения, разрушаемость, отменная, такой интерактивности, как здесь, пожалуй, ни в одной другой игре нет, также разрабы почти сумели создать крайне интригующего персонажа, а именно уборщика, но почему-то не сумели хоть как-то его раскрыть. В целом у игры больше минусов, чем плюсов, сюжет уныл, геймплей надоест очень сильно к концу, враги говно, боссов нет, интересных персонажей ровно 2( гг и уборщик), и то их не раскрыли,  пушек мало, прокачка и квесты примитивны,локации cntrl c + cntrl v, музыка ни о чем, зато у нас графика хорошая и разрушаемость, не рекомендую крч."
49,Steyraus,"Aug 18, 2020",2,"Horrible boring badly optimized game that they charger customer  again for it to run ok on next gen, The actual game is massively overrated and only Games Journalist liked it because it had a female protagonist and derpy men in the game.Its utterly boring, most of the game is runing around ugly arse environment, lost because there is no capable map. Combat is fun for about 1 hr but you so OP that the only way they could add difficulty is with ranged  one hit kills from invisible enemies. I really hated this game and Hate what remedy has become."
50,Damislav,"Nov 26, 2019",8,"It runs very good and looks amazing for lower settings that I played on. Story is little bit abstract which may be good or bad thing, depending on taste.  Atmosphere is amazing and gameplay feels really good. Throwing people around is very satisfying.."
51,GoodMorningAss,"Mar  6, 2020",5,"This may be for someone a ""masterpiece"" I have not mastered, too boring. The wait was a completely different project. The graphics and destruction are excellent."
52,baconmania,"Jun  1, 2020",6,"This is a pretty good game. Interesting story, good visuals. It'd be a much better game if it wasn't trying so hard to be a Soulslike. The studio seems to have gone out of their way to make the game frustrating to play, and in an exploration-focused game like this, there's just no need for that. A lot of potential in this game, but in many ways the experience is spoiled by choices the designers made. Some examples:- Combat difficulty is absurd, even for just random enemy encounters, and there's no difficulty setting- Fast travel points aren't well distributed, so you have to struggle your way back to where you were every time you die, which will happen constantly- There's no minimap, and the map that *is* provided is a single graphic which overlays all floors (of which there can be five or six). This makes the map much less useful than just one map per floor. My feedback to 505 Games would be, next time, don't try so hard to be ""hardcore"". Just make pretty games with good stories and let people enjoy the game if they want to play at a more relaxed pace!"

56,Deaden,"Aug 25, 2020",1,I deleted this game after playing an hour. Just went to watch ending on video channels and I see I got the right decision. It's an ultra boring class game.
57,bar1,"Sep  2, 2019",10,"Love this game. For some reason this game gets a lot of hate and those negative reviews seem to be totally out of place. From my point of view at least. I hope too many people don't skip this game just because of negative spammers. It's pretty much 10 or 0 from the reviewers, which is hilarious. Anyhow... I run at 1080 resolution with all graphics maxed and it has worked like a charm. (Remember to use the latest drivers dated aug 27.) So with RTX 2070 max Q I can get all the raytracing and oh my it is a noticeable technology. All the see throughs and reflections etc. Very nice. Looks fine without them as well but it really is some cool and new. Gameplay has had no hiccups. For me everything works like it should and the telekinesis with the shooting is very enjoyable. I do not recommend to play it in one go, just take your time and explore. Story is good, enjoyed much. Haven't read ALL the documents etc. YET and I can see how this game is not for all todays fast food consumption gaming addicts. To say the plot and story is not good most likely means you really haven't taken your time to even understand it but just rushed through the game. If you have played it through in 8 hours, you have missed a lot! The whole game. So it is not a game for everyone but that is what makes it interesting. You either get it or you don't. Usually the best kind of games! The world is amazing. Weird, enchanting, surprising and there's always something totally unexpected coming around the corner. I will be spending a lot of time exploring the world even the game is finished. Waiting for additional content already. GO WATCH SOME VIDEO REVIEWS AND DECIDE THEN. Seems those are legit at least, whether they gave anything from 0 to 10."

60,Rydik,"Sep  2, 2019",10,"Wonderfull game, having tons of fun, pretty good story, very atmospheric and stylish, love Jesse. Solid gameplay, maybe little repetitive.Has some problems with optimization."
61,joshbreviews,"Aug 31, 2019",8,"This is a really good game that's held back by some really obvious flaws. A few more months of tweaking gameplay and story, and this could have easily been a 9/10 or even 10/10. PROS Amazing world-building (amazing lore, amazing atmosphere, fully-realized bizzaro-office complex, etc.) Decent core gameplay (guns and powers feel good in general) Graphics and sound are really good (plus, amazingly almost-fully-destructible environment) CONS Main plot is not so good (player character constantly narrates explanations for major plot points which you would NEVER EVER intuitively figure out on your own) Braindead AI and extremely basic enemy variety (this is offset a bit by fun guns and powers) Acting is hit and miss (this is also due to the writing not really giving the actors room to breathe or express themselves) Almost no mission variety (offset by the occasional good story mission or puzzle mission) Pacing is hurt by the semi-open world structure (this game would've been much better as a linear, super-focused game); lots of time wasted backtracking and wandering around for the objective 8/10. The world and the core concepts are there, but execution needed a few months more polish. It saddens me cause this really, really could've been a wildly amazing game. Read on for a deep-dive: The pacing of the game is really bad. For the most part you're doing fetch quests for 3 characters. And then, suddenly the game cranks it up to 11 in the final act and you're left thinking ""darn, I wish the earlier parts of the game had this much scenic variety and plot developments"". On top of bad pacing, the plot points don't really make much sense. The main character keeps explaining things for you as they happen and you're just meant to nod along. In contrast, Alan Wake's plot was clear as day and easy to follow. Plus, for Alan Wake, his narrations were deeply woven into the style and direction of the game so it felt natural. In Control, Jesse's narrations feel off; the narrations feel as if they're just there to compensate for the nebulous plot. Additionally, in Alan Wake, the plot and the gameplay were so intertwined that it felt like you were watching a movie; the game kept you razor-focused on the main plot. In Control, it's very easy to forgot the main plot as you do fetch quest after fetch quest. In Control, the main bad guy, The Hiss, is always talked about, but never really explained; in contrast again, The Shadows in Alan Wake were straight up explained by Wake himself as the game progressed. In Alan Wake. you can appreciate what you are fighting. In Control, the game just tells you ""The Hiss is the bad guy. It's a mystery why they're bad. Why? Because. Deal with it."". Additionally, Control's ending is SO BAD. Yes the bad guy is beaten, but it doesn't feel like anything significant happened. Compare this to Alan Wake's ending which was amazing and monumental and clear. It really feels like Control's story was so focused on being weird and unique that it forgot to be a good story in the first place. Wasted potential. The core gameplay is decent but needs work. In general, combat is too simple and too easy. This game could've used difficulty modes. The game should have also made its resource system more complex. They should have added cooldowns to abilities on top of the energy bar. They should've lengthened ammo recharge time, but made two separate ammo pools that recharge independently. Why make these changes? So that you're forced to diversify your approach. I'm not kidding when I say you only need the Launch ability to kill everything. The only reason you'll use your gun is because you're waiting for more energy to cast Launch. Launch is too powerful and everything else is so weak in relation that it makes the combat extremely simple. Add to this the extremely simple AI and enemy variety, and I can easily see a lot of people getting bored with the game after a few hours. Lastly, the level design. It's semi-open world, which is a bad thing for this game, honestly. All the backtracking it makes you do is not fun. It's a shame because the wow-factor of each new area is great; but it diminishes rapidly the third time you revisit the area. I have to compare it to Alan Wake again. Alan Wake was linear, but it was better for it. When the game is linear, you can polish each enemy encounter. You can polish each platforming section. You can polish each vista and scene. When the game is linear you can make awesome one-time scripted events. In this semi-open world, wonders of the office complex fade away greatly with every re-visit. The only good thing about the semi-open world design is exploring for secrets; but again, this is also something you can also do in a focused linear game. If they make a sequel to Control, I hope the review their past wild success with Alan Wake, and re-focus Control to try and recapture Wake's mix of charm, mystery, levity, and gameplay."
62,philzlz,"Sep  1, 2019",9,One of the best action games of this year with the most spectacular implementation of ray tracing yet. While the fighting mechanics with its same enemy types became repetitive near the end game the story will keep you on edge. I wasn't particularly impressed by the trailers of Control but couldnt stop playing once i started the game. The FBC and all of its secrets and collectible documents are one of the most interesting locations i have visited in a game. This is Remedy in its old form.
63,matcarfer,"Sep  3, 2019",9,"Im a fan of CONTROL. First thing I say is this game is awesome. I just registered on Metacritic just to post my review as I see this great game is getting undeserved bad reviews.Played the game on pc at launch, bought it on Epic Store, finished it in 20 hours aprox, on my Intel i5 9600K, Vega 56, SSD, 16GB RAM. Locked to 60fps in Ultra at 1080p. Graphics: Photorealistic mixed with fantasy. Some structures are crazy in a good way, particle effect blowed me away and in general felt like a next gen game (PS5, Scarlet). Could have use some color variation on enemies. 9/10 Gameplay: just great, Jesse moves, shoot, and throw things beautifully. The game is a mix of metroidvania, with dark souls, with classic 3rd person shooter. 9/10 Stability: Found one silly bug in my 20hs playthrough, which I reported to Remedy. Game is super polished. Most polished game I played in years. Story: convoluted as hell and a really different to all AAA games, this is the type of stories that I think before I go to bed, tell my friends about it, discuss online and see videos just to undestand more. It's a great mess, but its great. Many things to watch, read and listen. 8/10 Content: has many missions, some suits and skills to unlock, personal and mod weapons. Has an upgrade system for weapons which I find it nice. There also random events. Missions are varied and a nice change to classic AAA games. 9/10 Sound: oh my god. I played the game with headphones and ambient sound and music are oppresive, it got to my nerves many times. Also sound effects are top notch. Loved it. The guys that hang from the ceiling talking like crazy made me cringe. 10/10 All in all, the game is a 9 for me. This game is a nice change of style and play. Things that Id change if I could:-Enemies could use color variation, specially for high level enemies.-More varied attack skills to Jesse woudl be great as shoot and throwing stuff is super repetitive.-Endgame content. Random event encounters are not sufficient.-Photo mode (already planned by developers).-I miss achievements/throphies. Developers should make them internal for PC [using a menu] (like some other games) as Epic Launcher doesnt have it.-There are no internal statistics for the game. I dont know how many items I still have to collect, hidden rooms undiscovered, missions undiscovered, boxes to open, etc.-Epic store is crap and exclusivity to it bothers me. I dont hate it but lacks achievements, hours played, game blog (to know developers news and updates), unable to locate installed game or move it to my ssd, fps counter, and more. Please like if it was helpful."
64,VAX_78,"Oct 23, 2019",1,"Strange game ... The principal character is ... not interesting, the gameplay is boring with ""deja-vu"" GO/BACK system, collect information to enlarge the story was good in 2000, the gameplay is repetitive as hell and the places crossed are all the same. The only thing that deserve to be observed is the progress on how the light is rendered. But be carefull, nothing exceptionnal. I've read a tons of ""compliments"" on this curious product. Don't believe the hype. It's just a bad  game."
65,4ortik,"Sep  2, 2019",9,"+Игра очень хорошо сделана со стороны окружения.Разрушаемость это красота.Мрачный геймплей.Приятная мимика лица.Главный персонаж, который не молчит!!!Сверхспособности в совокупности с левитацией превращают игру в наслаждение. Взмываешь в небо и раскидываешь ящики во врагов или врагов во врагов. Под конец оружием почти не пользовался.Огромное пространство для изучения, что вдоль горизонтальной плоскости но и вертикальной. -Мы играем не за спецназ а за ""простого"" человека, получаем низкий процент попадания в противников.Очень запутанный сюжет игры. Я прошел игру и Я не вкурсе кто это или что это внутри головы находится у персонажа.Очень много текстовых документов. По началу это радует. Когда половина текста скрыта, в голове дописываешь, додумываешь. Но, под конец идут разные отчеты, письма сумасшедших. И это уже начинает раздражать.Беготня по одним и тем же локациям, по причине поэтапного открытия доступов и возможностей персонажа.Скомканный конец игры."
66,Clean,"Aug 27, 2019",10,Brilliant and intriguing thriller that keeps you hooked! One of the best games in 2019 so far!
67,exxr,"Jan 24, 2020",2,"This game needs more negative reviews. At first it looks and it's hyped to have great visuals. This couldn't be further from the truth since even on ""ultra textures"" the game assets look positively awful. Textures are very low res, grainy, smudgy, artifacty...you get the point for a game offering supposedly next gen visuals. It seems to me to simply be a ray tracing demo, with oodles of shiny reflective surfaces, way too many in fact making it gaudy. Usually game reviews always have someone claiming their [insert ultra high end GPU] is stuttering and I've found this to be false in 99.9% of cases. Not here, it's the 0.1% that actually has stuttering even with a RTX 2080 Ti which is just inexcusable. The story and game play...well what is there to write, they're downright boring with heaps of grinding and poor AI and the same monsters over and over and the overpowered yet uninspiring bosses just like every other review said. It really screams at you that this game was made with the only purpose of showcasing ray tracing and that's it."
68,Fuflick,"Sep  5, 2019",9,"Отличная игра, давно не получала такого визуального удовольствия, единственный минус для меня стрельба, а в целом очень достойно похвалы."
69,Gordar,"Sep  8, 2019",8,Very good game. The setting is mainly what is so interesting here. Gun play is also lot of fun. I can recommend this.
70,zi0,"Aug 27, 2019",9,"great atmosphere and physics, well made mechanics, first game shows real RTX solutions.in other hand, game looks unfinished (face animation gradient from ugly in some scenes to about perfect in others), AI is too dumb, most weapons is about useless.Also bad localisation, but it's last in the list.Looks like game use adaptive difficulty level, which have not good algorithm. Still I gave 9 points as game could be tuned with some patch."
71,Vasot,"Sep  3, 2019",6,Overhyped and overrated game with a weird story it's not so interesting. The game has some good visuals but definitely NOT next-gen graphics. Control is overall an OK shooter with demanding hardware requirements the game becomes boring fast and the shooting feels generic and very repetitive after a while also the plot does not make sense until the end. PS: Some idiots that give a 10 score to this they must be out of their minds...
72,shipo,"Sep  3, 2019",4,"Control is 12-hours game for kids with great visual. On start of game you will become the new FBI director, by entering into pure artistic oldest building. In the sixties you looking for your supernatural brother Dylan (he is like others currently in a coma). So Jesse trying fight back against evil entity the Hiss. Game story and progress is really bad (not even extrovert developers know mystery). They trying make some crazy superhero RPG shooter. POSITIVES: Detailed graphics; Destruction physics; NEGATIVES: Level design is based on unrealistic biggest rooms (there are un-functional map for navigation). Most sad thing is gameplay. Spawning enemies are stupid so they have millions health points. Level checkpoints are placed inconsistent. Game design is pure trash. They spend funds only on graphics and marketing. By deleting hundreds of lowest meta-critic user reviews, they make fake score 5 -> 7.1 (most 9 or 10 have only 1 review)."
73,Fedeastica,"Sep  4, 2019",10,"Absolutely amazing game. I played for like 30 hours, finished all side missions and I'm still hungry for more. I expected a Ray Tracing demo and I got one of the GOTY. The level design is great, and while the map it's not very helpful sometimes, I actually had fun looking for secret rooms and hidden corridors. The combat is a blast, especially when you're fully upgraded. I just wish there was a Game plus, as I would love to replay some difficult optional boss battles with my fully upgraded character. The story is quite convoluted, with many crazy flashbacks. Some missions and sections were absolutely trippy. Loved it!!!! BTW, the combat starts slow, so the game requires some patience until it gets more intense. If you like single player games with a rich story, great setting and fun combat get it!"
74,yoloman0805,"Sep  1, 2019",8,"A very refreshing action shooter. Even though the story could have been better the gameplay was innovative and fun. Also the world building was amazing. Remedy shows that your can build great gameplay world in closed environments. Also big pops to the maze level, one of the most innovative game level design I have seen in that mission."
75,snowrabel,"Sep  1, 2019",10,Very high quality action game. Unique story and excellent game mechanics. Beautiful graphics! PC with RTX on is just pure candy for your eyes!

77,Vergesso,"Sep  6, 2019",10,"I am delighted with this game and can not find almost any reason for criticism. For me, there is a fascinating story, an interesting world so that it does not bother to collect information and read documents, and in addition - fascinating gameplay. I saw complaints about weak enemies that miss shots, but I have never encountered anything like that - all opponents are deadly dangerous. I play this game with pleasure and I will surely do it a couple more times."

81,ustijoz,"Sep  6, 2019",10,"Love this game. atmosphere is haunting and creepy, story stays pretty vage but i love it for that, the combat is really fun, and there are soo many secrets."
82,gamerrab,"Aug 31, 2019",8,"This game is too clean.  Its the opposite of Quantum Break which was nice and colourful. Its also very black, grey and white and the world is quite dull and lifeless.   From the PC point of view, graphics are great and control -via keyboard of-course- is precise and excellent - WAY better than Quantum Break which had a dire PC control set up.  Graphics are crisp an...dull.  There's the odd bit where you break out of concrete into the ""real"" world of rocks and caves and it feels so refreshing; but its not long before your back into concrete and pipes.  The shooting is a bit of a frantic panic - perhaps that's just me - but keep on the move and you'll b ok.  Upgrading is the usual frequent need to visit the menu system which I still haven't really sussed out yet. Why they have to make these upgrade menus so complicated defeats me.  The boss fights (wow how I hate boss fights) are tedious as usual, their SOLE aim being to slow you down so that the developers say it'll take X hours to play the game, when, without boss levels, you could do it in half the time.  However, its a great effort by 505 Games.   Gamestyle-wise its a mix of Aiien Isolation (on your own in a pretty life-less world) + Prey (strange shaped alien creatures) and Inception (yes, the film - you'll know what I mean after paying it for 10 minutes).Plot-wise - who cares if it doesn't make much sense?  The missions are quite clear and progression is obvious.  8/10."
83,Gizilq,"Aug 31, 2019",8,"Довольно неплохая игра, с несколько репетативным геймплеем. Негативные оценки оттого,  что геймдизайн, делающий фокус на окружении и ЛОРе, понравится далеко не всем. некоторым подобное скучно и не интересно. Субъективно, 8 из 10. Pretty good game, with a few repetitive gameplay. Negative ratings are due to the fact that not everyone will like a game design that focuses on the environment and Lore. Some people find it boring and not interesting. Subjectively, 8 out of 10."
84,aralath,"Oct 29, 2019",8,Watched through a walkthrough video series. Unique story as always from Remedy.
85,Himmler1,"Nov  3, 2019",3,"Remedy, что с вами ?После просто великолепного Alan Wake вы выпустили сначала какой-то дешёвый подростковый сериал с элементами научной фантастики.

Зачем объяснять всю ту чушь, что уже вывалили на игрока - лучше навалим ему ещё. А разнообразие геймплея тоже ни к чему. Вот тебе один ствол, вот телекинез.

It plays very well and lot of collectibles everywhere to learn about of location and story.Game looks really great, nice office building representation combined with abstract locations. I like all those paranormal abilities and game mechanics. Ray Tracing makes game absolutely different, full of realistic details. Graphics with RT on is another level of player experience. It even perfroms very well with DLSS which do not make game too blurry. Only indirect diffuset lighting do some wierd artifacts especially on light colored surfaces."
88,villihabasau,"Sep  1, 2019",10,"This is the best game of 2019 for me so far. It is a great gift for all gamers who love ""The X-Files"", ""SCP Foundation"" and ""Alan Wake"".

I'm sure, this game will become cult and ""Hidden Gem"" status in the future."

91,meadx,"Sep 25, 2019",10,"Очень не плохо, поставил 10 так-как рейтинг занизили хейтеры. Игра получилась вполне хорошей и стоит прохождения ,но есть небольшие НО. Получилось немного затянуто, игра заметно становиться лучше после 60-70% прохождения сценария, прям улёт!  Вопрос зачем нужно было так затягивать? А затянуто тут многое, крафт оружия и дорогая цена модов, мало материалов, да и преимущества модов слабое, так и враги становятся сильнее т.е. получаться много бесполезного гринда.  Я на середине игры чуть не забросил прохождение, но сделал супер вещь, хакнул материалов и получил то что и должен был по идеи в игре. Ушёл тупой гринд, подбор модов стал более интересным (но количество 3 секций для модов считаю малым, нужно было поднять до 5.). Всего-то надо было увеличит число падающих материалов для модов х5 х10 особенно с секреток! Дать возможность их крафтить в большем количестве, а не так что за пол часа игры можно 1 мод. Из 10 модов 1 - 2 которые подходят, зачатую даёт моды на экономию патронов, с чем в игре нет проблем вообще. В целом это всё наверное что напрягло и считаю эта тупняком разработчиков к которым остался вопрос ""Зачем так тупо?"". Разрушения от перестрелок 10 из 10, подача, сценарик, атмосфера, гэм дизайн 8 из 10. Рекомендую!"

93,ScytheNoire,"Aug 30, 2019",2,"If you want to know how bad of a year this has been for games, especially on PC, just consider that this is ranked as the #13 Best PC Game of 2019. Once again a game that spent more on advertising than it did on actually making a good game. It feels like a console game ported to the PC, and not a good port.   I'm sure they'll push out another few sequels just to cash in on the marketing money they already spent. Don't believe the critics, they are paid shills for the publishers. Hopefully 2020 turns out a better year for gaming."
94,bloodrizer,"Sep 21, 2019",2,"This game is a beautiful, excellently optimized and masterfully crafted tech demo. It spend so much time in pre-production that Remedy actually forgot to include any gameplay. The gunfight is boring and undeveloped, the combat mechanic would need at least a year of polishing, the enemies are all the same and the boss fights were probably never even playtested.Control is basically a Quantum Break without the guns with all the issues cranked up to 11. (Everybody who played the game also know that bosses routinely one-shot you and there are no checkpoints so you have to grind your way through the game) I would probably forgive game having no gameplay, but the worst part is that Remedy took SCP universe and turned it to the most boring, most unimaginative and most generic concept that you could only imagine and this I cant tolerate at all."

96,Chris-Ziemacki,"Aug 30, 2019",9,"I have finished playing the game and I must say it is a great game. One of the best single player games I have played for some time now. The combat system has a great flow. The way how characters powers and ammunition are restored, the way you pick up health makes the combat very fast paced. The graphics are astounding, especially with the RTX turned on. Physics great, the setting interesting. The game is technically polished. There was one crash for an over a dozen hours of playing. The frame rates are solid. I have played all the game with the fps overlay. On my i7 6700K, GF 2080 and 32GB of RAM on maxed settings 1080p and RTX turned on the frame rate oscillated in the 50-60 fps range. Rarely dropping below 50 fps. With RTX turned off 60+ fps of course. But the RTX is worth it. It looks amazing! The maps are interesting, complicated, well planned. It is enjoyable to traverse them, especially later on with levitation. The story could be told a little bit better. There were times where I felt confused. I liked the idea for the story but I think that story in Quantum Break and Alan Wake was told better."
97,DreamCore,"Sep  3, 2019",8,"Pros: * Good performance. Really smooth without lag on max settings and full RTX and DLSS (2k) using a 2080 Ti.* Graphics are superb.* Gameplay feels really polished.* Very unique setting/story. Cons: * Enemy variaty is lacking and it does get repetitive eventually.* Weapon variaty is lacking and I felt little reason to use anything but the standard pistol.* Most story is explained through collectables, meaning lots of reading if you want to understand the bigger picture. It's not for everyone.* Some of the side quests are really dull (although a few are really cool)."

101,AllNewSuperfake,"Sep 16, 2019",6,"They did a great job of telling an interesting, well paced story that still made me feel like I was in control. No aggressive cutscenes, no heaps of exposition, just letting me figure out stuff for myself. Then came the next 15 minutes of the game, and I found myself mostly in the role of the co-pilot. Still, things were interesting, and the destruction physics quite nice. Except that they only really worked in the tutorial when it came to crushing enemies who turned into bullet-spongy annoyances from the first encounter onwards. And yes, you could still destroy everything except for the stuff that you couldn't destroy, which is quite a lot and therefore makes it seem like a gimmick. It never was really used as a game mechanic, as a way to get from A to B without having to shoot the same set of increasingly hard to destroy mobs, or to uncover the unseen, or do anything else except for making your attacks way more impressive than they were, and of course that kind of destruction is great material for videos and trailers. It couldn't keep me from getting bored really fast. If this had been an animated movie, not longer than 150 minutes, where I could just sit back instead of going through waves of clones and bosses and having to pick up shinies along the way just to get on with the story, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. The feeling of disconnect with the character due to the direction and presentation was less dominant than in Quantum Break, but still left me wondering why these people make games instead of films. Really liked the tone and atmosphere and the general style though, and if you enjoy shooting and blasting your way through a decent movie while collecting stuff you will find a polished experience that gives you exactly that. Or watch someone else playing it, because - and that's my main grieve here - it doesn't really feel any different."

К сожалению, нет сигнатурного замедления, ну да и ладно.Понравилась игра за геймплей, лор, да и сюжет неплох. Среди минусов: дисбаланс способностей (телекинез - самое сильное оружие в игре, тогда как щит из камней зачастую бесполезен и неудобен в использовании); 2 активных слота оружия - хотелось бы больше; система модов, как в какой-нибудь игре-сервисе/дрочильне, уродует годный и динамичный геймплей; слишком много записок. Лор основан на SCP, так что тут все в порядке (более менее). В плане сюжета - им не успеваешь насытиться и хочется еще.Крайне неприятно, что Control - игра, которая на голову выше прошлого творения Ремеди - имеет рейтинг сравнимый или даже ниже Quantum Break'а. Несправедливо. Исправляю."

The realease date for many game are wrong (exemple : Control Release at 27 August, on the player library it says available the 28 ...)Next, the game release at 12:00 CET, and at 16:00 CET ... the game is set to Unavailable on the library. The game itsefl is not a bad game, but, after enjoying playing the photorealistic and theater-narrativ like Quantumbreak ... This game look like so far away from the last RemedySoft.I think playing this one on PS4 or XBox would be a better experience, but the Pc Gameplay is just so bad ... character movement are just random, absolutelly not immersiv or realistic, gunfights for a TPS aren't smart at all, the IA are just overdate ... spawn just run to you firing around like zombiegunner. Ok i don't go really far in the game, so my opinion isn't really objectiv but ...FPS drop, floating movement, doors opening alone, no animation, lips sync absolutelly awfull !!!!! Guns aiming/fight not really smart, main character not so attractiv at all -> speaking about the narration or the narrativ reaction from Jess .... Maybe latter in the game many things would be better or the scenaristic sequence would explain why the character look like drugued when she speak about something ...But after 2Hours playing, i feel really frustrated. 60euros for this one is just abusiv."

Map - on which it is not clear how to get there (an example on the map is a room and there is a wall in front of you and so on) Items that do not have time to load. The gameplay is so boring.

110,KorvaRousku,"Aug 27, 2019",10,Awesome game by Remedy. They make interesting and fun games. Maybe the best game of the 2019.
111,hiddensynapse,"Aug 27, 2019",10,"Okay, this game is incredible. First, let me say that this game runs beautifully on my RTX 2060 SUPER completely maxed out at 1080p. The ray tracing is gorgeous - easily the best use of the feature I’ve ever seen. The difference is night and day. Haven’t tested 4K yet, and FRAPS doesn’t work for some reason, but it seems to hold a steady 60 FPS with occasional and very minor frame drops (barely noticeable). I’ve been waiting for a game like this since “Psi Ops” - so it’s been a loooong wait. “Control” may be the best game of the year so far, better even than “Sekiro” (and I’m obsessed with From Software games). The user and critics scores are not reflective of the game’s true quality - the reviews up on YouTube are far more accurate. Definitely a 9.5/10 (deserves to be at least an 88 on Metacritic), and possibly better than Remedy’s claim to fame, Max Payne. I’m an actual parapsychologist, and the developers have clearly done their research on the subject. Be it Jungian psychology, astral projection, or real-life experiments on telepathy and psychokinesis, this game has it all. If you’re a fan of the paranormal or even just the X-Files, this is a MUST BUY! Thank you Remedy."
112,MCDyatel,"Aug 28, 2019",8,"I liked the game, in general it’s hard for me to please, as I have been playing games for several years, but this game was able to impress me. Good graphics, good shooting and combat. Great sound and visual effects. At the moment, there are a sufficient number of bugs, but in the near future they are likely to be removed."
113,AkeeMTC,"Sep  1, 2019",9,"Finished it in one go. Lovely graphics and atmosphere even without RTX on PC. The destructible environments are the best I've seen in a game so far. There's also that special feeling that lights up inside of you after demolishing your enemies by throwing a forklift at them. Some extra performance polishing, few hours more of content and a more easy-to-follow/explained narrative at times and It'd be a 10/10 from me."
114,bmn_,"Dec 14, 2019",0,"I loved Quantum Break for its story, so I thought I should try Control - big mistake. After 147 minutes I arrived at the first boss fight which not just isn't fun, it is an awful experience. The boss does massive damage and needs 3 hits to kill you. Try to kill soldiers to get health? Get at least one hit. Run around and get stuck on some object laying around, get hit twice. Run to cover, discover there's a soldier in the way, get hit again. There is no way to change the difficulty, fps drops make aiming a difficult and the sluggish movement of the player character makes it easy to get stuck at corners of objects. The story starts off intriguing, but the frustrating gameplay ruins it. Would refund it if I could."
115,Z_R_K,"Sep  9, 2019",10,"Очередное неоднозначное произведение непонятное массам, но глубокое в своем повествовании. При том игра попыталась угодить и простым игрокам, предоставляя разрушаемость, красивые отражения и т.д. Но, к сожалению, большинство не поняло эстетику брутализма и однообразные офисные интерьеры, суть которых завязана на повествовании и сюжете. Наоборот, нужно восхищаться как студии с бюджетом в 4 млн. удалось сделать такую интересную, сложную и глубокую игру. Remedy лишний раз доказали что они все еще на коне. Хейтеров мне сложно понять. Игра по запутанности повествования ни в чем не уступает культовой Alan Wake. Возможно, дело в том что выросло новое поверхностное поколение Fortnite, для которых игры - это всего лишь развлечение. Надеюсь лишь на то, что игра окупится и поможет творцам из Remedy и дальше творить шедевры.В иделе - нужно чтобы их купила Sony, дала кучу денег и полную свободу творчества. Тогда может выйти отличная игра. Тот же Quantum Break мне очень понравился, несмотря на технические проблемы на релизе.P.S. Проходил игру на следующей системе: Ryzen 2200g, 8 GB RAM, RX 570 Nitro+ 8 GB на ультрах в FullHD. Комфортные консольные 30 FPS получил и очень доволен. При том после прохождения игры мне захотелось исслеодовать её дальше, завершить все побочные квесты. Уж слишком интересен и загадочен мир Control. Крайне советую игру к приобретению тем, кто любит произведения Дэвида Линча и восторгается логикой сна."

124,TheFrog,"Nov 15, 2019",7,"I'm a long time fan of Remedy, and loved Max Payne 2 and Alan Wake + American Nightmare. Not so much for the gameplay, as for the incredible atmosphere, the indirect storytelling, in which music played no small part, the little details. I was a bit disappointed by Quantum Break, it's as if the big production money took away from Remedy's vision.Now we have Control, and in my opinion it's their best work in terms of gameplay by far, mixing weapons and PSI powers with quick movement. The story setup is great and perfectly coherent, as long as you accept the supernatural leitmotiv.The story that unfolds is unfortunately not quite as good as Alan Wake's, it's much more linear. Jesse Faden enters a mysterious building looking for someone, along the way grabs the sword in the stone (not literally but almost) and becomes Queen of England, or at least Director of the super secret FBC. From here, she'll have to solve an ongoing crisis, gradually gaining new powers, new weapon forms and access to more and more areas, but while the shifting reality of the building remains mesmerizing, the story itself does not provide too many surprises.There's a lot of material in the form of notes, correspondence and audio recordings, allowing the player to delve deeper into Control's world. After a while, though, it all started to become boring. I loved audio recordings in the old System Shock 2 because they told the tale of dozens of NPC who died on the starship it was based in. People who got swept away before the player appeared, good or bad, fighting or cowering in fear, they made the story come alive. In Control, after 100 notes about this or that mystical artefact, with dozens of words redacted to make it clear that the FBC takes secrecy seriously... ok, ok, I get it, but 10 would have been enough, how about providing something more varied?As I said, gunplay is lots of fun, but the powerup system leaves a lot to be desired. You have a very limited number of slots to customize your character and her weapons, so that I felt very constrained in my choices. Extra health + extra health regeneration are almost a must. That leaves you with ONE free slot and a lot of powerups that provide minimal effect. This is an area that would deserve a rework, in my opinion. On the other hand, I really can't see what people find wrong in the in-game map, I never had any problems, it's not like there are 20 levels on top of one another.Some bosses are downright infuriating, I can't imagine what it would be like to fight them using a controller. One forces the player to fight in a small room where the boss can mix explosive fungus, seeking spores and super strong direct hit combos, another one has you fight on a rather small square suspended in space, with the floor that gets eaten away by every enemy attack, so that you can aim at the enemy and fall through to your death, or look at the floor and not shoot.Finally, it's very sad for me to see Remedy go Sarkeesian. Tough female protagonist, check. Male NPCs = mostly jerks, check. Tough, competent, reliable female NPCs, check. It's not as black and white as in so many other games, but still you have a tough as nails ex CIA agent and a competent scientist facing a jerk custodian for a warehouse of altered items, a jerk head of Communications who disregards safety procedures to his own detriment and a suppposedly reliable chief of security who cannot even protect himself. TL;DR Good:- Gunplay with PSI is fun- GREAT supernatural environment- Very good music by Poets Of The Fall (love the maze sequence)- Very good graphics Bad:- Infuriating boss fights- Limited freedom in configuring your abilities- Monotonous collectible story material- Grrrl power, luckily not to an extreme extent"
125,BulgarianCritic,"Dec 29, 2019",7,I have very mixed  feelings about this game.Half of them are positive and the other is negative.Firstly i will start off by  saying that this game is 80% inspired  from the scp foundation.The altered items(Scp's) the bureau (SCP foundation) and everything else.That for me is a positive since i loved the SCP foundation before they ruined it.Now that doesn't mean that the game doesn't have its own story.It does and i did like some parts of it but most of the story was pretty standard and 60% boring.It had some good and interesting parts but they were too few and far apart.The characters were alright the VA of the main heroine was  in my opinion really bad and i didn't felt any  hint of emotion  when she spoke.Darling on the other hand was  **** amazing.I loved every scene when he showed up even made me wonder if this guy was a professional actor or something since he was really good at acting  and every time i watched him he seemed super entertained in what he was doing.God Bless that man.The other characters are your standard sub-human trash with no unique perks or personality .Gameplay wise  60% of it i loved.The mechanics and power-ups you get are pretty good (except the levitation part which was really badly programmed).The enemies were pretty standard with barely anything unique in them.I loved reading the summaries of the altered objects(SCPs) but that's because i love stuff like that.The ending was ok nothing special really  it looked more like it was made to sell the game's future DLC which i will not be buying.Music was good especially when the soundtrack started playing in the trippy Ashtray Maze.Man i loved that part it was soooo goood  with all the moving rooms and doors and awesome music loved every bit of that part.Overall it's an alright game and if you are an SCP fan this is probably the closest you will get to an SCP game so you better check it out.-1 because they decided to be greedy and go Epic store Exclusive.Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

129,Sjalka,"Aug 28, 2019",9,"In my opinion, this is a very good story .. i mean game. I love the style, the sound design, the amazing use of colour, lights and shadows. And for that .. this is an amazing game indeed. What i do not like so much is - at least on my end - very slow loading textures sometimes, resulting in extremely blurry graphics at times .. which makes the game look genuinely 2004. the VERY inconsistent character design .. wish some characters being amazing in both modelling, mimics and behaviour/animation .. others looking like they belong to another game, a much older one. Sadly, the protagonist herself is one of the models that (in my opinion) is rather one of the bad models (face design - she just looks very non emotional, static and lifeless) ... all the while Emily looks amazing with MUCH better facial structure and expression. Run/Jump courses ... this seriously breaks immersion with me. While i like the shiny marble surfaces and abstract design - it just takes me straight out of the creepy Some game mechanics are not well enough documented, especially the crafting part (if you can call it that) - in fact .. the crafting part feels very much like it was an afterthought. The AI - not very good. quality over quantity would be preferred, also better balancing. I would have MUCH preferred not to have enemies literally spawn on top of me sometimes .. and also .. some ""bosses"" seem to play dirty with spawning basic mobs all over the place. But since i value atmosphere and storytelling over almost anything in a game .. it still is a 9/10 for me .. for someone that looks more at the gameplay side and not the story ... well, it might just be average"

131,KaaloFin,"Aug 30, 2019",9,"Control is a beautiful game in terms of art direction and graphics. It is supernatural, but feels real. Grounded in to reality by the brutalistic architecture and other mundane aspects of the world. The story is wonderfully weird and there are some really fun characters (like Ahti) that make me smile. Loved exploring and finding weird stuff hidden from the beaten path. Can't control my excitement for more content (through DLC's). Played with 2070 Super - card, on an SSD and faced no serious frame rate dips or other visual glitches. RTX On."

Pc is the best but forget running ray tracing as you'll need a beast.  I had solid performance at all times with 1080p high settings and vsync off.  Best vsync fame I've played.   Never screen tears which is amazing.So graphics are stellar and music and sound as well as voice acting great.  Brilliant gun sounds.The gameplay is solid. Really fun and creative.  So much fun.The game lasts about 12 - 20 hrs depending on your play style. Proper single player campaign in 2019.Remedy has done it again. Max Payne, Alan wake and more and now Control.Can't stress how good this game is but....the beginning is slow and confusing. So give it a chance.

I don't understand all the average or negative opinions, considering all the titles that got released so far, but anyway. It's got a lot of action, explorations, diversity, some decent RPG elements. A lot of freedom which, if not available in the beginning of the game, is given to you at some point. The story is interesting and confusing. It is one of the prettiest games to be made and not only that, it contains complex scenes and surroundings that well present the spirit of the game. It is dark and almost scary, but up to a comfortable point. Which is the case with most of Remedy`s games. I think the game easily deserves at least a 8 out of 10. It may have issues when it comes to story, gameplay, its technical side etc, but it surely is unique enough to ignore its negatives."

166,zNeverSleeping,"Sep  1, 2019",8,"Um jogo dificil de se analisar... Como um fan dos jogos de Remedy - principalmente Quantum Break, eu estava deveras ansioso por esse game. Sendo assim, as expectativas estavam lá no alto, o problema é que o jogo nem se que atende pontos extritamentes necessarios para um game que se prese funcionar: Gameplay, storytelling e otimização. A gameplay é divertida a principio. Os poderes, junto com as armas e seu poder de fogo - tanto nos inimigos quanto no cenario, são absurdos. Chega a ser satisfatorio destruir tudo a sua frente. O jogo conta com uma fasica avançadissima. Provavel que seja a melhor atualmente. Enfim, voltando ao ponto... Nas ultimas horas de jogo, simplesmente perde a graça. Tudo se torna muito repetitivo, e o jogo, como um todo, me parece desequilibrado. Há armas muito superiores a outras já existentes, inutilizando o resto. A mesma coisa acontece com os inimigos. Fora que o jogo simplesmente não sabe quando acabar. Com uma gameplay dessa, deviamos passar, no maximo, 8h de gameplay na campanha principal. Os graficos são lindissimos. A iluninação é surreal e a fisica, junto com as particulas de destruição, são de deixar de boca aberta. Porém, a otimização é porquissima. Numa RTX 2060, consegui 60fps estaveis quase todo o jogo, mas em momentos de estresse, chegava a cair pra 45/50 no DX12 - que apresenta um problema chatissimo de stuttering, que por sorte, não me incomodou tanto ao passar do jogo. No DX 11, tinhamos menos uso de RAM, VRAM e mais FPS. O problema é que, na minha maquina, apresentava um bug quando eu minimizava o jogo. Simplesmente havia quedas para 30 fps. A historia é uma completa icognita. Não acho que seja ruim. Na realidade, acho que antes devo entendê-la a julgar antes, o problema é que o storytelling do jogo é confuso e indeciso. Eu simplesmente não peguei mais de 20%  da historia do game - sendo otimista. Há MUITOS arquivos, e como eu não tenho tempo pra ler por conta dos estudos, fiquei a parte dessa camada do jogo. E, se esses arquivos explicam a historia, alguem explica pra REMEDY que textos são para informações adicionais, e não pra historia principal... Por fim, é jogavel e vale a pena a compra numa promoção, muito por conta dos graficos apenas."

The gameplay and controls are nothing new but once you play it... it fell like if those mechanics were just new. The game has a bizarre and entertaining story and kind off makes you think you are watching a high budget Hollywood movie.The game is essentially an open world game that take place in one setting, there are main missions and side missions. Enemies have a level system like every open world that gets release today, you can craft new abilities and upgrades for your weapon to deal better with enemies.The art style is amazing, crafted with geometry and lighting, for some it will look simple for it's minimalist level design, but the shadows and lighting creates an artistic level of immersion.Unfortunately... Control suffers off a terrible navigation system, yes... the game has a map to guide you, but overall is hard to know  in which floor you are and how to get to your objective, this cause me to miss lots of secondary missions, because i never knew which direction or which door was open to get there.Still... Control is an enjoyable game, that plays smoothly and looks amazing."

174,Oakatsura,"Sep 25, 2019",10,"Running a Ryzen RTX 2080 Ti System, and this game is flawless, everything runs smoothly using the new Ray Tracing technology and looks absolutely gorgeous. The fluid motions and action makes each combat seem renewed and breathtaking. You cannot come close to touching how good of a game Control is. If I had gotten this game for free from my RTX 2080 Ti Purchase, instead of Wolfenstein: Youngblood (Horrible btw), I would have paid the company for a their work, that's how good this game is.Another brilliant title, that I hope to see more of in the coming years, I really miss these Psi-Op / Action / Adventure / Compelling Story types that drive you into the story, and keep you wanting more right until the end, and leaves you sated and astonished when you are done."
175,bonzo,"Sep 19, 2019",9,"If you enjoy X-Files, Alan Wake, SCP Foundation, or Legion, then this will be right up your alley. The story and the lore surrounding it are interesting and engaging, characters are unique, and there's tons of details strewn about within the game world. Navigating and combat can be a chore sometimes, but not a dealbreaker. A high-quality gem from Remedy."
176,p1menta,"Oct 13, 2019",8,"there's a lot of cool stuff here. it actually makes me really mad about how theyve never done a really good proper star wars game. half Jesse's powers are jedi/sith related, and it just works perfectly. how can this work that well and make you feelmore like a jedi than battlefront 2 for example? F you, EA.an other great feature of this game are the graphics. holy damn, i played this in max quality pc and hell, it's so gourgeous that it's even weird sme times. it almost causes a disconfort looking at something as beautiful as this game.  even with a billion particles flying around and explsions and gunshots, and there was no framerate drop whatsover.but that also brings one down point. with this kind of graphic power we wanna see different sceneries, it becomes too repetitive too fast. (almost) every room looks like the previous one, there's like 5 different enemies that repeat through the whole game over and over. they didnt even explored well the astral plane. it should have had at half a dozen enemies like the fridge one.another point of the game that took a point off my grade here was the plot. like, there was a great background here for a great story, but it seems underused. like they ran outta time, and couldn't properly finish developing the plot, idk. something is not right.still, it's a great new IP, i was happily surprised by this one"
177,OHIC,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"This might be my favourite ever game world. I think it's perfectly pitched, in terms of lore vs gameplay. You get a great movement and combat system, so if you're not into reading logs and watching monitor clips then you still get a great game. That said, there are hitches where, if you miss a stray comment, you might end up lost for what to do at times, and the map/navigation system is pretty terrible (but don't worry, it gets better! Once you figure it out, it does eventually get a lot easier to traverse the world). But aside from those minor issues, it's a fantastic game that only gets better in the DLC, where the movement system and combat options combine to give you unusual puzzles. This is one of those games where you shouldn't think ""main missions > side missions"", since side missions are some of the best parts of the game. It's nice to see a game that doesn't force you to see all its tricks, but it would be a great shame if you stormed through the game and decided you were done. There's a whole other game's worth hiding, so explore, keep going back to talk to characters, whatever you can do to find all the secrets. Still, I do like the modesty of the game that I can have conversations with other players where each of us has seen whole missions that the other has not, and then go back to catch up."
178,ItsPeartree,"Aug 30, 2019",8,"Starting things off with one of the most relevant aspects of this game. Is the RTX worth it? Definitely. However, using an RTX 2060, I was only able to enable RTX by using NVIDIA DLSS which forced a resolution of 720p. RTX is expensive AF, but its beautiful. Moreover, there were moments during the game that got me to go ""WOW"". The gameplay is also very satisfying. During the game I never thought that the gameplay was repetitive because of how fun it is. Jesse's abilities are just cool. Throwing objects around at enemies is always a lot of fun and the visual feedback is really good. After a fight you can see all the destruction you caused. The lore surrounding the Bureau and the Oldest House is cool. However, I feel like the story is lacking in a lot of aspects. I couldn't relate to any character and the ending feels rushed and very confusing. The environment could be more varied given the setting. The only unique environment is the Maze. The game would improve a lot if it had more environments like that."
179,EmranBayati,"Sep 21, 2019",10,"Control is an awesome combination of a 3rd person shooter gameplay, rich story and fascinating visual graphics, its a ray tracing masterpiece if you play with an RTX. Remedy has been one of the leading-edge game studios, developing great AAA games in new and creative ips every time.you won't see 10 assassins creeds from these guys, new IP every time. worth every penny."
180,Karmazyn83,"Oct  7, 2019",9,"Control....will take over all your free time so you could finish it and love it just like I did. I would lie if I said that I have even a brief idea of what is going on it this game. I am confused. I collect documents, tapes and try not to miss anything but I still do not have any clue of what is going on. I have decided not to collect any intel as it made game more confusing. Unfortunately I do not own RTX card so can't marvel ray tracing at its best. I play game on GTX 1080 at 1080p at the downstairs 65 inch Sony 1080p TV (through STEAM link) and game looks superb. I cant even imagine how better it would looked like with RTX lightning effects. The environments, characters, soundtrack and all amazing particle effects. When you start shooting broken glass, documents, chunks of walls fly everywhere. When explosives goes off the are is lit and more amazing particle effects fall and bounce off the floor. I intentionally do not aim direct at the target but fire whole magazine everywhere just to create more havoc. It looks and sounds amazing. I also like all the special powers. With fully upgraded telekinesis skill I am able to throw forklifts, rip huge chunks of the concrete pillars and launch it towards enemies. The skill is great. The same can be said about levitation. Hermiona would be proud. The levitation looks so cool. Remedy has created something truly unique and special. Game is fabulous ! I might have no idea what is going on for most of the time but OMG, do I enjoy every minute of it. Step into shoes of intriguing and wonderfully voiced Jesse Faden and try to make sense out of the story. Trapped inside Federal Bureau of Control you fight with Hiss and try to rescue your brother. All of this is a very confusing background to a spectacular third person shooter. Pros-Ray tracing support (so I have heard)- graphics- shooting- setting- telekinetic super powers Cons- confusing story-what is going on again"
181,WannabeGamer,"Sep 12, 2019",8,"TL;DR: A good story driven single player game with decent combat, interesting exploration and some character development choices. No wow-effect, though.--- Control (PC) was an enjoyable experience for me. I liked the story, although the narrative feels a bit glued over. It was fun to play around with different armaments and skills. There was a constant feeling of progression as the missions took me around the premises. The collection of materials and narrative extras didn't feel like a chore, but instead just happened by way of thorough exploration.--- Graphics are pretty, but this game is very GPU hungry. Soundscape is interesting: annoying and immersive at the same time. I ended up hoping for some more ""real"" music in the soundtrack.--- Gameplay: 8Story: 7Graphics: 9Sounds/Music: 7"

I just gave it a 10 because I can run it on my immortal gtx 750 ti on low preset with textures cranked up at high on my fricking tv. Can run this in static 30 fps at either 900p or 720p. Still better than playing on my ps4."
187,Valon518,"Sep  9, 2019",8,Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Remedy games! Alan wake was a great game and so is this. I loved some of the story tie ins with control and the events in alan wake. Both games in my opinion have a great story. Controls story is very syfy driven and keeps you interested. Even though the way that you can interact and manipulate the environment isn't anything new it is very enjoyable. I absolutely loved all the collectables and the way that they really developed the backstory or at least some of the history of the federal bureau of control. My only complaint is that all in all the battles are not all that challenging. Some of the bigger boss fights were a little tuff but all in all not all that hard.
188,podzorama,"Jan 20, 2020",7,"Up to a point, I really loved this game.An intriguing mysterious and Weird story-line set in The Old House, part Secret Government Centre and part Portal into several other dimensions. You play as Jesse, as we uncover her back story she uncovers the whereabouts and reasons for the disappearance of her brother Dylan in a wonderful Lovecraftian/Prisoneresque action adventure: Guns, Levitation. Telekinesis and Mind Control abilities combine to make this a supremely fun game.What I most liked about the game,was the fact that quite early on, I seemed Godlike in my abilities, and getting to learn to use them wisely and upgrade the abilities I felt comfortable in, made me feel ahead of the AI. Sure I died a lot, either because I was rushing or being stupid, or had to learn a different approach to different enemies, but always felt I was in Control (...see what I did there?).There was a point in the game where that disintegrated. Some of the optional Control Point Bosses were just frustratingly horrible to fight, losing all the action momentum it becomes suddenly like taking on a Dark Souls boss: wading through endless trash mobs to get to main fight only to be oneshotted once you get there. The end game also seemed to take a sudden difficulty spike, and had me roaring at the monitor in anguish and frustration. Not Fun.Despite this short coming it was overall a blast to play.Seven and a half outta ten"
189,Bitek,"Aug 31, 2020",10,"One the best single player games I played in years. It is pure game art. The story is very interesting but it is confusing. You will need to do additional research to understand some concepts from the game. Concepts in this game are based on Carl Gustav Jung theories. Side missions are awesome. Puzzles are challenging. There is a lot of stuff to read in the game. Getting from one mission to another is never obvious. There is no path set by the computer to follow from point A to point B. You will need to figure out on your own how to get to your next mission. This will encourage you to explore the world of Control. Game mechanics are awesome, weapons, powers everything is cool. Do not forget to get the DLCs. I am playing Foundation dlc now and I love it. It is just as good as the main game with new abilities and new enemies. Control is easily 10 out of 10 game. One of the most unique experiences in years for me. Get control and be prepared to be confused and amazed at the same time."
190,DarthPadme,"Jan 31, 2020",7,"This game was pretty good. Remedy and 505 did a fine job optimizing a solid experience that ran well on PC hardware and was forward-thinking in the space, with RTX touches not seen in many titles yet. A mix of Psi-Ops and FEAR, Control sees you play Jesse Faden as you begin to unravel a poorly-told story about the Federal Bureau of Control, the massive facility you start off in and are suddenly director of (and immediately accepted by absolutely everyone), your past, and various powerful artifacts and objects of power hidden within. You unlock new abilities along the way, including some you can simply skip if you aren't going out of your way enough, and collect bits and bobs that allow you to upgrade them and your weapons. Overall the experience was pretty streamlined, but a poor map, awkward pacing, odd live-action vs. animated cutscenes (and poor facial capture), and janky controls for some later abilities prevented me feeling truly ""in control"". The story really wants you to just accept it so earenstly but it could have been so much more. I liked my 10 hours or so with the game, but is it 2019's game of the year? No way."

I'm a fan of shows like The X-Files and Fringe and this game has a very similar feel. Usually in games I just pass over all the dumb little audio logs/journal pages/codex files etc. that are littered everywhere. But in this game I actually sought them out. The setting is just that good."

I'll be listing some Pros and Cons.Pros:+ Super nice graphics+ Awesome physics system and destructible environments+ Fun gameplay, combat and abilities. I can't stress this one, enough.+  Interesting environment and world and mysteries which actually leads me to delve into collectibles and what happens on the projectors and TVs inside the game+ Some pretty surprising moments. Cons:- Useless and hard to navigate map.- Pacing- AI's being a little dumb at times. I still think this game was absolutely worth the price and a very solid game."

Playing this with ray tracing on is a treat. The gun-play is satisfying yet challenging and the progression of your abilities is great, you start the game as just another person and by the end you're a superhero. I'll definitely come back for the DLC."

This game took the immersive games and storytelling to another level, outperforming easily a lot of movies. I really hope REMEDY can bring more content and games like this, It's amazing. The combat was also great, balanced combat and difficulty, challenging bosses. The skills from Jesse are badass! You can basically fly, dash and throw anything at the enemies. I really wish the movie industry see the high potential of this game becoming a movie. Amazing surprise !!!"

Its like they've made this game specifically for me, and I hope this team will continue doing this :D The only thing I didn't like in this game is a music box levels, but since they optional and were added with a free update, I don't care about them."

207,mrsalty101,"Nov 25, 2020",10,I can't believe all the negative reviews on here. Half of them admit they gave up after an hour while the other half call the story confusing with no back story. Try reading just a few of the notes you pick up while playing. If you're too lazy to play past the intro or read for 5 minutes I don't know where you got the energy to write a review. One of the negative reviews even said it was trying to be a souls-like. Really? Calling a sci-fi shooter with super powers a souls-like? Unbelievable!
208,disulfiram,"May 25, 2020",10,"Nearly perfect game in my opinion. The only negative for me is, it doesn't control well on mouse and keyboard. I don't know what exactly but something doesn't feel right for me. I ended up playing it with a game pad which is fine. Even though the action is excellent and a 100% fun constantly, sometimes I wanted to get it over with just so I can enjoy other aspects of the game, like the environment or some sort of story progression.  Speaking of which, personally I loved the flow of the story but for some people it's a major issue so that's worth mentioning. Somehow a lot of people have said the game is excellent and yet I was surprised at how enjoyable I found it On the technical side of things, the game runs butter smooth on my work machine with a cheep Radeon 580, so I'd say it's pretty well optimized. I don't remember the last time I was that impressed with a game."
209,Hurrikhan,"Sep 20, 2020",4,"The game is pretty. The RTX can give some nice reflections until the game crashes systematically (for me a boss fight) and you have to switch to DX11.The music are very very nice too. I'd love to hear the Bowie-like one that was played in one of the very few great moments of the game. Because of these good points, I've rated this a 4. What follows is why I don't want to give more that that. The story started well. It's weird, twilight zone style, but when I've reached the end it felt unfinished: like peeling a fruit and finding out it was all peel. What I really didn't like though was basically everything else: Whoever thought it was a good idea to lose 10% of your ""money"" for each death should be flogged. The fights are boring.  They are mostly too easy, but sometimes stupidly difficult. An example would be hiding some key points in a (boss) fight in areas way too dark to see where you are killed in one shot. Another example would be expecting you to find some items you don't know you need, hidden behind some panels you don't know exist in some dark area while an invulnerable monster teleports to you to one-shot you. Yet another example would be to swarm you of monsters where you have no chance of survival if you don't know what spot will keep you ""safe"". How about letting you go in an area where you have no chance to progress? (Giving you a mission for it and closing the door behind you at some point.)Of course you don't know this and reaching some obstacle you hope some tricky jump-dodge will get you through. All you get for your trouble is getting killed until you give up. The controls do not feel right either.The ways you use some powers are unintuitive. Every time I've started the game I had to take two minutes to adjust to it. Speaking of the controls: you often need to ""grab"" an object.One would expect the one at the middle of the screen to be the target instead of some random garbage located out of your field of vision when it's not right behind you.  Yet another crap that can make you killed. Avoid."
210,NerdN8,"Feb 18, 2020",10,"Очень понравилась эта игра в первую очередь за шикарную атмосферу и отличный сюжет, а так же его подачу. Великолепная графика и музыкальное сопровождение. Немного не понравилась стрельба, но использование способностей это компенсирует. Игра довольно сложная местами, однако больше получил удовольствие от этого, нежили раздражение. Много отсылок к другой отличной игре от этой студии. Игра явно не для широкой массы которая не привыкла к сложностям и тому что в подобных  играх надо мозги включать. В общем доволен на 100% и жду dlc!"
211,squalledu86,"Apr  5, 2020",10,"Nice game overall. Just want to make a remark on RT. Maybe this is the first RT game that I play and can tell the difference. Like, I don't remember my console games to look and reflect like that. If you have a GPU that supports RT maybe this game is worth checking out. I played on a 2070 and made some tweaks to the auto graphics settings, I did get some performance issues but minor I'd say. With RT on I can only remember some drops in frame rate in non-crittical stages of the game. I mean, like during boss fights or enemies encounters in general I don't remember having major issues even with RT on which is great (AFAIR).Lastly, a game where you play like a Jedi having the skill to manipulate objects from a distance, that's a cool mechanic, how has no one thought about a game like this before? :-) (if there's a game with this mechanic out there I just don't know it or don't remember it right now) Using these special powers is nice. The game is a bit more challenging than usual but it's still playable. If interested maybe one of those spring sales that are going on right now might be worth checking. Happy gaming :-)"
212,NanoThunderGod,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"I played control because I got it on a sale. I wanted to play it since it was from the developers of Alan Wake, one of my favorite games for the Xbox 360. I was not disappointed, the game has a great story and characters since the beginning. It is a must have if you like Action Horror games."
213,Skaamit,"Sep  5, 2020",9,"Maybe it the Game of the Year for me. It's a good and interesting game with some problems. Visual and audio aspects are the most strong sides. An environment is wonderful, beautiful and fascinating to explore. I so like the general mood, the freaking atmosphere of tension, pressure, uncertainty and this new world created by «Remedy». The soundtrack is a pretty ambient, places that work well with the pressure atmosphere of the game. A shooting is not very good, but a mix of fire and abilities is great gameplay with a pleasant dynamic. Well, I can describe the game like a stylish souls like game with a gun – the main character have not a lot of health and enemies kill her very fast, especially in close combat. And one more – extra materials (notes and other) is good here. I had a great pleasure on this week. Thank you my dear Finnish game developers."
214,DoomCronos,"Jan  4, 2020",3,"Art direction might be only score I give to this game. Remedy Entertainment tried really hard to bring back some max Payne 1 style of battle system and that atmosphere but poorly pulled it on their new game Control. _repetitive battle system- Boring and slow storyline- Bad acting for main actress, Courtney hope. While I love many games with female protagonist but her acting was poorly pulled that i couldn't make any empathy to her character, Jesse. ( i have no idea why she nominated for best performance ) In good side of the game, I can only point on Art Direction, Graphic, and maybe music. But seriously Also Poet of Falls  couldn't repeat their ""One late Goodbye"" Song that we all have memory with in Max Payne. Their songs in Control game might be interesting but not as much as Max Payne.For me, Control is a fail game with annoying characters, except Emily Pope that she was interesting. and slow built story that is sort of confusing but also boring."
215,Sholva,"Sep  1, 2020",10,"I did play this game last year, a bit after it came out on the Epic Games Store, but I didn’t write a review back then because I knew there was going to be some sort of DLC/s released in the future. One year later, the two story DLCs have been released, so I’ve played through the whole game again, with the DLCs this time around as well. To say that this game is one of the best Remedy has ever made, is an understatement. Control, as the name implies (and that implication has many, many facets, for sure), is just the game where Remedy themselves have finally seized “control” of all of their creative prowess to, finally, open up the way so their true vision can come forth: connecting all of their games and universes into one, and Control has made that possible with the most unique and incredible story-telling which obviously has the seal of quality of Sam Lake’s writing, for sure, and many others who’ve been working at Remedy since the beginning. What the future brings for all of these universes and creations from Remedy, we’ll see, but the future looks quite bright, indeed, considering what they teased recently in their 25 year anniversary blog post they published. On the more technical aspect, the PC version of Control is an amazing looking game, powered by Remedy’s latest iteration of the Northlight Engine, previously seen in Quantum Break; in Control, this engine really shines, no pun intended, as the lighting, reflections and shadows are pushed to new levels, even more so for those with RTX enabled GPUs…this game is really beautiful even for me only running a GTX 1070, with a Ryzen 5 3600. The game is smooth enough albeit a bit GPU demanding when cranking those settings up but it’s tradition that most new Remedy games are quite demanding: Max Payne and specially Max Payne 2…for that one I needed a new PC back then, for sure, it looked amazing for the time; Alan Wake was a masterpiece on every possible level, but the engine (the same Max-FX engine from Max Payne 1&2) was revamped to the limit, as thoroughly explained to us in the Director’s Cut edition of Alan Wake; then came Quantum Break, with the Northlight Engine, and that game to this day can be more demanding on my GPU than even Control itself…the lighting was amazing too in QB. The keybinds for mouse and keyboard are excellent in Control, no issues for me, despite being a left handed player, everything can be remapped. All in all…Control is a truly unique experience, one that every Remedy games fan, old or new, should experience, ASAP, but do so by taking your time, explore every corner, read every file and think, use your brain to try and connect the dots from all the little clues, easter eggs and mentions of other Remedy games and characters and stuff. That said, don’t think that just because it’s the game Remedy claims “connects” everything, it’s void of story on its own, because it is not, not at all: Control does have a very interesting story, completely new from any previous Remedy’s games, but familiar in many ways, especially in the “Remedy way”, if you know what I mean. So yeah, with all the content available now, Control feels complete, yet leaving me wanting more, a lot more, because this game won’t explain everything to you, as it’s the case in all of Remedy’s previous games, you need to put your own thoughts into the mix too, and draw your own conclusions, it’s the Remedy way, always has been. The AWE DLC felt a bit short to me, and I personally believe that it should’ve been the first to be released, because I’ve seen that those owning the Ultimate Edition can play it from chapter 7, or something, on the main campaign, which makes sense. The Foundation DLC feels like a decent Epilogue to the main story, and that’s why it’s played after beating the game. It added a lot of background to certain characters, but also leaving them all the more mysterious at the same time, another great trait of Remedy’s story telling since Max Payne. Overall, I loved this game, its gameplay, visual direction (it deserved all the accolades it’s gotten, for sure) and the story and writing, something I’ve always enjoyed in the other Remedy games: they all have superb writing, and Control is nothing short of amazing on that front. Do yourself a favor and dive right into this fantastic world…you’ll feel right at home if you played any other Remedy game, which I recommend, anyway : )"
216,SilverOrlov,"Mar  5, 2020",9,"This game is a ""picture"". Not an action movie, not a story book, but a picture, that shows us an unusual and mysterious place, with its secrets and changing environment. Some paranormal things and events and at the same time it does not forget to treat the visitor of this place with dangerous and unknown enemies. Often you can hear the complaints of players that there is no plot or that it is excessively obscure, confused, paranormal. But the problem with these players is that they ""only see the top of the iceberg."" This game has a plot and a story that really has a very unstable shape like a simple long stick, this plot can be seen and almost completely understood if you are more attentive to the game than to a simple ordinary shooter. And even so, the cornerstone of the game is not in the plot, but in architecture, atmosphere, light design ... Control ... the situation in the building, key points, objects of power and so on.Well, for those who are especially persistent, they have notes, correspondence, recordings on a voice recorder, video tapes.I really want to see a sequel that would either put ""all the points in place"" or give an open but adequate ending to the whole story.This game for me is a ""Magnum opus"" of Remedi studio ."
217,LogTech,"Dec 18, 2020",10,"Amazing game, mechanics, dificulty, story and characters. It reminds me to the times of Max Paine. that history captures you till the end of the game. a MASTERPIECE. Amazing JOB REMEDY!"
218,svonton,"Jun  1, 2020",10,"Take of my hat to Remedy it was perfect experience of controlling the Bureau of paranormal things like SCP thing's (you probably know this famous universe). I'm so loved SCP and all stuff around it and remedy game bring me all this felling by searching ordinary things that isn't ordinary at all. All this pseudo scientist documents about incidents with paranormal and thing with some power that cause this incidents, all this ""classified"" or ""data deleted"" in this documents, damn i love it. But what about game play? this is in door shooter with some kind of multi tool (your personal weapon that can be anything you want: simple pistol, shotgun, smg, sniper rifle or grenade launcher). besides multi tool you can use pool of abilities that you can unlock by controlling ""subjects of power"". You will meet a lot of them while playing this game. All this can help you to kill different types of enemy (them no so many but all of them have unique abilities and behavior). because this game reminded me SCP universe i start completing the side quests: all of them can bring you some points for upgrading your abilities, but what interest most of them can tell interest story and some of them can give you epic boss battle (and as for me its another plus of this game because if you don't wanna challenge yourself you can just skip this bosses and concentrate on the plot). So in conclusion i can say that this game definitely will be liked by SCP's fan or pseudo scientist movie/books/cartoons or what ever fan's =D"

223,alanwaketan,"Feb 17, 2020",9,没有RTX加持的情况下大概也就八分的样子。但是在RTX加持下，Control真的是把光线追踪融入到了整个游戏gameplay当中，比如用各种微妙的光影效果来引导游戏推进，海市蜃楼motel里就用光影来暗示哪间房间打开了。再加上加入大量玻璃钢筋等可以着重强调光线反射的现代素材，真的是一个栩栩如生美轮美奂的世界。这一脚踢开了次世代的大门，不愧是RTX大型宣传片。

227,Chukree,"Jan 19, 2020",10,"Best Remedy title so far. Everything was amazing, from the combat to the jaw dropping visuals and narrative. I wish games like this got more attention instead of reboots and crappy sequels. Control > COD"
228,CoccoBill,"Nov 20, 2019",10,"Another excellent game by Remedy, the makers of Max Payne 1 & 2 and Alan Wake. + Gameplay is awesome. You're able to use powers that would make any Jedi impressed. And instead of a light sabre, you have a shape shifting gun that can do different things. The combat feels really really good and is super fun. + Story is all about weirdness, the good kind of weirdness, and mystery. It has this David Lynch movies kind of atmosphere. Excellently written and acted (the Ahti character was especially brilliant), Max Payne quality. It's by Sam Lake so no wonder. He's one of the best writers in business. + Graphics are gorgeous, by far the best use of RTX of any game that's come out. + Sound design rivals the great graphics. This game has earned a nomination in 7 categories of the upcoming 2019 Game Awards: + Game of the Year+ Action / Adventure Game+ Art Direction+ Audio Design+ Game Direction+ Narrative+ Performance - Courtney Hope and Matthew Porretta I think this game is one of those rare games, that you just must get. Just like Max Payne. I really hope they make Control 2."
229,linosia,"Dec 10, 2019",9,"One of the best games I've ever played. There is a problem with navigation, though (map helps a bit but not really). Optimization could be better. Levitation comes after you completed 2/3 of entire main-campaign (so it's minus). But overall mostly positive impressions"

For me easily the game of the year. Well done Remedy!"

235,C-A,"Feb 13, 2020",9,"A breath of a fresh air game to play, with a nice combat system, especially later in the game naturally.The story is good and it has good weird characters. This is a game you should try to play not only the story quest but also the side quest or you just miss almost half of the quality that control has to offer, including some of the better boss fights!"
236,YouKnowWho2020,"Dec 15, 2020",10,That was awesome.Loved every minute of it. The Ultimate Edition refines the game and every part is perfectly weighted. Recent AAA releases really shows just how unrated Control is. Thanks Remedy et al
237,microbee,"Feb 18, 2020",3,"Flashy combat.. cant see much there. While i do enjoy good effects and this game has plenty - i wish i could see past them, not struggle to aim. Destructive surroundings are good though (reminds me of F.E.A.R). Start of the game is promising, you are skillfully introduced to the basics but from there, it kinda goes downhill. The idea of a building where it all happens is appealing to me. This game could be alot more.. i can already see the vision of it and so do you (when you finish it i assure you).. I dont want to spoil much lets just say i expected more from Remedy. While i did play the whole game i wasnt involved in the journey that much. Remedy showed their talent in the past sadly this time, i was dissapointed. Not sure where to start. The game quickly became repetitive and boring. Weapons are boring , i prefer more realistic approach like in the past. Expeditions are just hilarious, randomization/timer ruins the experience (feels like a speedrunner was testing those) especially since weapons and abilities are weak .. enemies become bullet sponges. I can see fun in that but for me, it was quite a frustrating experience. Maybe difficulty levels wouldnt harm this game. Dont expect alot of colors.. prepare for white or red light in your face.. watch your eyes with this one.I dont recommend playing it on big TV.. Lack of variety overall - similiar rooms and weapons, same upgrades and enemies most of the time and because of that, gameplay suffers. Tempo could save that aspect of the game but it's not done well. Freedom feels confusing in a maze. Somewhat confusing ""puzzle"" sections as well. Story is confusing..which some may like but i didnt, characters are just non believable so i didn't really care.. . Rtx is not optimized. I think the worst thing about Control is that it feels quite rushed. I think quantum break is much better game than this one.. Remedy, Alan Wake (or something like Max Payne.. where you nailed the atmosphere, tempo and gameplay) would be much better choice..for your next title.. show these nextgen gamers how it's done.. Sound is good, there are some great moments while playing nevertheless. Some people may like Control and i understand. It feels like a combination of all of your previous titles and experience but its like you werent given enough time to polish it properly. To sum it up, I am too spoiled by Max Payne and Alan Wake to give this a good score. Or maybe we as a whole should lower our standards (of expectations, ability,..)? Make a mix of max payne 1 and die hard 1.. action packed skyscaper with weird **** going on, visible exterior, changing weather, nightday cycle, realistic weapons, encounters  from bottom to top, sharper graphics with less bloom, a few crazy moments and bring back comic book style narrative.3.4"
238,josefpadrio,"May 23, 2020",1,"Very disappointing. Extremely repetitive and boring.RTX effects quickly becomes meaningless in a bland environment which is same everywhere.Firing at very similar soulless enemies all the time using the same gun.Same environment everywhere, same enemies, same gun, meaningless story."
239,nmayx,"Apr 21, 2020",10,"Very nice game with difficult to understand the story but when you do it  become very interesting, about gameplay i can tell that some boses is difficult to defeat because of not simple mechanic of the game."
240,Allehandra,"May 30, 2020",2,"Absolutely dreadful. The only redeeming quality of the game is it's visual side - It looks stunning.Everything else... Jesus, where do I start? The combat is pretty basic, but enjoyable. Marred by gamey upgrade and crafting management ala Nier: Automata's. Out of the 4 or 5 weapon modes, you can only carry 2 at one time, which seems like a missed opportunity since they can be highly situational.Then you have the quest design - There's a plethora of bounties and timed alerts that boil down to ""Shoot X dudes in area Y"" and they give you more generic gear upgrades, woo. Then there's the respawn mechanic which places you at a checkpoint, having to replay entire sequences before restarting fights and you loose an arbitrary 10% of not-money like in Borderlands. There's even an arena side quest that requires tokens which need to be bought with said not-money or dropped from enemies or bounties, ugh. And finally, the worst aspect - The writing. It's clear that the lead writer LOVED the SCP Foundation but wasn't able to replicate the atmosphere. The amount of bloat with pointless documents and videos is unbelievable. Only a handful of them land the mark, while the rest are just a chore to read/watch. The game just takes itself too damned seriously.The characters are walking info dumps, with the shining exception of the cryptid Finnish janitor who probably secretly runs the place. And then there's the ending. You go through yet another enemy arena, your character loses her marbles and then the game makes you go through a tedious section where she thinks she's back to her dead-end office job and the game, I **** you not, has you running around and pressing the use key a hundred times or more on various objects. Followed by more exposition, a ****ty platforming section and another enemy arena.After that, the game ends abruptly. I cannot comprehend where the praise for this game comes from. Seems like everyone who loved this game just shrugs off any complaints by saying that you're ""too stupid to fully understand the story"" or that you didn't read all the filler documents to ""fully understand what's going on"". Like, no, I'd rather drill a hole in my skull than read any more of that drivel."
241,Dragoi,"Jun  5, 2020",9,"Absolutely love this game. The controls feel so, so good. I've never played a game where the controls worked so well that I noticed it, but moving and shooting are just effortless in this game. Everything does exactly what you want it to do. That alone makes it incredibly satisfying, and the story only builds on that. I really enjoyed the trickling way that the story is told. Combine that with the crazy fun combat, and I loved it. Highly recommend."

Те 13 часов, что я в ней провёл, бегая по Бюро, были довольно весёлыми и интересными.СЮЖЕТ на удивление не такой запутанный, как здесь пишут, и он весьма неплох. Ближе к финалу (почти)всё становится на свои логические места. Ясно-понятно, что всё это Бюро, потусторонние явления и объекты, что оно изучает, были любезно взяты у SCP фандома (особенно  интересна побочная миссия с холодильником, от которого нельзя отводить взгляд, где-то мы уже подобное видели), но своей оригинальности это у Контроля не отнимает.Хочу отметить ДИЗАЙН локаций, он здесь восхитителен, как и СТИЛИСТИКА самой игры. Обычным брождением по этажам Дома можно получать эстетическое удовольствие.ФИЗИКА, она великолепна! Когда ты поднимаешь в воздух какой нибудь стол, все бумаги на  нём разлетаются.РАЗРУШАЕМОСТЬ ОБЪЕКТОВ, она здесь тоже хороша. Враги могут разрушить колонну, на  которой ты собирался изображать снайпера, обстрелять ракетами твоё укрытие.Балл отнимаю за иногда затянутые и частые бои, которые ты иногда можешь проигрывать, начиная заново и уходя в самое начало миссии, раздражает!БОЕВАЯ СИСТЕМА похожа на их прошлый продукт (QB), где она мне тоже понравилась. Крайне рекомендую к покупке, хорошего дня!

250,HollenZorn,"Dec  1, 2020",9,"Control's story is refreshingly dramatic & wildly stimulating. It has elements of the horror, RPG, & action genres. The combat, although repetitive, is extremely enjoyable by continuing to introduce new ways for the player approach enemies and formulate new tactics. Control easily puts the major game developers/producers to shame by simply having a highly substantive & intriguing story. This is NOT a cookie cutter cash grab."

252,Dreweliss,"Dec 15, 2020",10,"A delicious story which never ceases to impress by its consistency and variety. A truly refreshing storytelling where the use of real life actors images somehow never conflicts with the fiction but actually help its anchoring in our reality. The gameplay never bored me as our character never stops learning new skills. The simple exploration of the Bureau ensures itself the change of scenery. A unique game and modern Lovecraftian experience which is to me the biggest ""Action-Adventure"" revelation of those 10 last years."
253,Patres87,"Jun 14, 2021",10,"As a Remedy fanboy, I only regret not to have played this game earlier. For me it's another masterpiece, while I didn't play Quantum Break yet. Love the concept of a federal bureau investigating paranormal events in a setting of the game with a changing environment sounds very original to me. The soundtrack and the ambience with chatter of talking voices in background which I was able to decipher were mostly in German language kept me on my heels throughout the whole game. The storytelling is done with few cutscenes mostly in-between missions and side quests and the approach is very gentle. The rest of the story is brought to you non-invasively should you be eager to learn more by simply collecting documents which are place around the area, which gives you a glimpse on what you are currently dealing with or what is about to come. This pace of action, exploring and learning about the events fits me well as I could shift my attention towards different things and slowly put together the pieces of the puzzle. There is no difficulty setting and you have a number of abilities that will help you defeat the enemies. I failed number of times after an exhausting battle, but took another approach next time and eventually I felt more satisfied. The deaths are sudden and once you catch your self in a crossfire or overpowered, it doesn't take very long for you to die. So even, if you defeated the main 'boss' in a fight, the battle might be far from over. Love the fact that there is a point health system and not some auto generating health. While enemies drop health points, you have to be strategic in the approach and the sense of urgency to flea, recover and come back, not just hide in a corner for the health to restore is what really spices up those battles. There is a checkpoint system, which saves your progress after you capture what is called 'Control Points' or just fast travel to them. I must say this game really hit my sweet spot and is really a brave approach in an astonishing series of games made by this studio. Bravo !"
254,Acquire,"Sep 12, 2020",5,"On its surface this seems like an easy recommendation.  It’s beautiful to look at with some of the best ray tracing visuals out there.  The paranormal intrigue of the story hooked me in.  The combat system and action is immensely satisfying.  It quickly more or less falls apart. I couldn’t tell you what’s actually happening with the story. The intro sets up a good premise, but nothing of interest really happens after that.  There seems to be a big tone disconnect between the main character and everyone else.  We get to hear her inner thought bubbles, which present a person in high distress.  Everyone else, despite being in a situation of clear calamity, doesn’t reflect that at all. They all seem calm, composed, worry free, maybe not by intention, but by lack of character development.  All NPCs are just there to serve as objective givers and receivers.  They’re not actual characters, which makes the whole experience feel disjointed.  The game is properly challenging for the most part, but it employs some badly implemented souls like mechanics.  Deaths are punished by permanently removing upgrade points and teleporting you back to the last activated save point. Enemies usually won’t respawn, so all this second mechanic does is waste your time. To make matters worse the game is frustratingly difficult to navigate. I felt constantly lost and the in game map is awful. About three hours in and you’ve seen the entire variety of the gameplay and the story will be dead by then.  The game quickly becomes repetitive as you struggle to find your way from area to area while fighting the same enemies using the same basic tactics over and over all through an absent story. The game would also regularly freeze on me. It was annoying enough to get the game process killed, but upon restarting I would find that for some reason the last half hour or so of my game progress was lost. This is unfortunately the first Remedy game I won’t be completing.  I’ve loved their work before with Max Payne, Alan Wake, and Quantum Break.  This game has a good first three hours and that’s about it."

Remedy consistently push the boat out for games to be something DIFFERENT. Something SPECIAL. Not just another shooter game with no story or interesting setting. This is what video games should be about. Trying something new. Give players something they haven't experienced before. Yes, we have played third person shooters before, but not like this. This is special. Absolute GEM of a game. Ignore the review bombs from people crying about epic store or having computer potato so they can't run the game. Stunning with ray tracing, get a better computer and stop crying.

257,tamakachi,"Jun 27, 2021",6,"Bosses are extremely difficult and when you die the load times are excessive and there is no difficulty setting either, this can mean 2 minutes of challenging a boss before you die and then having to wait 5 minutes for the game to load again and add another 3 minutes to get back to the boss. I also find myself getting lost and not knowing where the to go because the map in game really sucks, this game is needlessly frustrating, I play games to have fun; not to be frustrated"
258,rocksoldier,"Jun 17, 2021",2,"This game is bad, very bad. The only good thing is graphics, all other elements are terrible:-Story is terrible-gunfights are chaotic and not interesting-character is totally flat and not existent-setting does not make any sense and it doesn't even look cool-most of the time you don't know where to go-anything you can think of that it's not graphic is bad"
259,Latzara,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"One ifnthe few games that gripped me in the last few years with it's story and setting. Even though there is combat throughout the run the story is the focus. I found reading the documentation scattered about the world and watching the videos just pulled me in even more. That's not at all what happens with other games abd their in game lore for me but here it just fit and it fit well. The openendedness of the story in which you have the feeling the answers you've found only scratch the surface of it's depths just made me hopeful for a sequel. If you like the setting of 80's sci-fi, or are a fan of sci-fi/horror movies of that era i bet you'll enjoy it greatly."
260,Sopota,"Jul 12, 2021",0,"Great story but awful storytelling, you have to constantly pause to read all the random stuff you pick up, sometimes great, but a lot of times pointless bureaucratic garbage that gets annoying very fast. You can't even hear the audio recordings while playing. This is a game from 2019, Remedy. Full of 2 hit death attacks, no one is suspicious that a lot of times you get hit for 99% of your health? Even maxing health only partially avoids this. The bosses are the worst offenders, full of bodyguard fodder. When the hardest part of a boss fight is not the boss itself... Horrible sound design, no enemy footsteps and crappy positioning audio means that you can't use your ears in a fight, if you hear a loud scream you better smash your evade button because you don't know from where its coming. At least in Alan Wake you can see your flanks with a wider third person view. And the cherry on top is the awful and uninspired crafting system. I say it again Remedy, this is a game from 2019."
261,RMDsilva,"Apr 25, 2021",4,"High level production resulting in a vaguely interesting combat system... and a story and ambience that tries very much to be something, but is really just a generic shooter with a poor plot trying to justify whatever.I'm not even sure there was a good idea there at some stage."
262,HSuke,"Sep 18, 2020",8,"Control is an FPS game with repetitive gameplay and a really bad upgrade system. The main thing going for the game is the story and the lore, which is somewhat interesting. Its world is like a very-neutered and mild version of the SCP Foundation (which is probably too shocking to be published as a AAA game). The artwork in the game is absolutely amazing, but it can't make up for the repetitive gameplay. By mid-game, all you'll be doing is spamming launch over and over again to kill enemies. The 2 DLCs are more of the same. You're better off just reading the amazing horror/sci-fi stories on the SCP Foundation website."
263,sonicmrsumo,"Sep 14, 2021",1,I really wanted to give this game a higher rating as it's so much fun to play...when it actually works. Unfortunately it rarely works. It either won't let you past the title screen or it crashes whilst loading / saving. I did try and stick with it but it just got too frustrating so didn't finish and uninstalled.
264,Allyptic,"May 14, 2021",8,"Great game with a huge focus on story, characters, and world-building. I don't remember the last time when the story absorbed me so much. Yes, there are few bugs here are there, but nothing game-breaking. Usually minor visual glitches."

268,fray_bentos,"Feb  4, 2021",7,"I am very confused by the praise this game seems to get. Frankly, after a few hours of play I found it incoherent, dull and unremarkable. I played to the end it peaked about 2/3rd of the way through (dimensional research), then it just ended. Even with an RTX 3080, I'm finding the graphics dull as well, it's mostly a concrete building with some flashes of red from time to time. Sometimes the red obscures the screen making it impossible to see. The enemies are repetitive, as is the gunplay. For the first few hours I had no chance to engage with the main character or plot. Since it is so weird and none of it has been explained, it means that most of it means nothing and gets ignored as nonsense, it didn't get much better. An utterly overrated game."

270,JiWiK,"Dec 16, 2020",6,"Control is pretty solid game. Nice simple story in complicated universe with trippy visuals, interesting gameplay and abilities. Entertaining but also very forgettable. Probably the only part you will remember long after finishing this game is hotel part with headphones. It is pure ecstasy of inovation with nice blend of epic music. If the game was like this all the time i would never forget this title. But it is not. I would give better score but it was ""Epic"" store exclusivity and it is unforgettable. This cancer of PC platform have to be stopped."
271,dandalis,"Dec 31, 2020",7,"Control is another solid outing from Remedy, but at the same time not as solid as Remedy's previous works in my opinion. The game opens up quite unusually, there's no fanfare, it just starts and off you go. From there you're mostly on your own in discovering mind bending and mysterious world that lies behind the exterior of the Oldest House.During the game you acquire certain paranormal powers that feel cool to use and aid you greatly in the combat. Speaking of combat, it feels old schoolish compared to other modern AAA 3rd person shooters, with there being no hand holding, no cover system, you have fast draining health pool that doesnt auto-regenerate and there's 1 universal difficulty which can be quite challenging even after getting grips with it, and i respect that.And what would be a Remedy game without solid shooting mechanics. Gunplay in Control was satisfying, with the more traditional forms of the Service Weapon like Grip and Shatter feeling weighty and mechanical. They also sounded really darn well too, especially the Shatter form which had a proper kick to it.I need to applaud to Remedy for pushing for highly phyisics driven world interactivity, seeing physics driven destruction was so refreshing in a modern game, because so many developers either have abbandoned it or simply lack the know-how these days in how to pull it off.However one problem regarding weapons and gameplay is that you can only equip 2 weapon forms at once, if you want to change, you have to go into the inventory every single time to equip a different one, and it's just annoying, having them all available at a push of a key or mouse scroll would've been so much more intuitive.And the mod system that exists for both weapons and powers is kind of a mess too, because the game bombards you with new mods all the bloody time, and with there being a conservative limit to how much you can carry, it makes micro management nigh infuriating.The non-linear nature of the game also can eventually become exhausting due to backtracking. I try to avoid fast travelling in games, however in Control, in a few instances fast travel was the only way to exit an area for some reason.Jesse's outfit selection also felt rather dull, even more so the optional outfits, only her director's outfit had some personality. Narrative in Control gave me fairly mixed sensations.The world, lore and setting the game introduces are very interesting, i read, listened, watched every piece of collectible i found, as the Bureau, it's history, mysterious elements and operations are really fascinating. The urge to find out and solve what has gone so wrong at the place is strong.Former director Trench and Dr. Darling in my opinion steal the show and kind of overshadow even Jesse herself, even though they dont appear in flesh in the game, they're that well written and performed.And here lies one of the main issues i had with the story, none of the characters that Jesse actually encounters in flesh are that compelling really, apart from the finnish janitor Ahti, who doesnt appear that much in the game, but there's just something about him.Speaking of Jesse as a protagonist, she also didnt impress me that much. The charisma and charm of the previous Remedy's protagonists just isnt there. Beyond Jesse's ''gift'', there's just kind of a unremarkable and quite frankly bland persona. If they wanted to subvert expectations with the ''average girl from the street'', then i'm afraid Remedy over achieved.And i just dont understand why Jesse swears so much, it feels so forced, like the worst kind of millenial writing that tries too hard to come off as mature, but comes off as juvenile instead, i simply refuse to believe that it's Sam Lake's touch, though even if it isnt, shame on him for allowing it to happen. Same can be said about other characters swearing, it just reeks of cheap writing, not Remedy pedigree. I'm not against strong language in games, however there's the right, mature way to do it, and the cheap, juvenile way.The final main story quest fell flat aswell for me, i expected something much more after all the build up surrounding the game's main threat, instead what i got was a feeling ""For real, is that really it?"". Now to be honest, that kind of a finale isnt really something new in a Remedy game, but it was handled so much better in Alan Wake.And the Bureau alerts popping up all the damn time during central or side quests was a dumb design choice aswell. There were also some inconsistencies that made me curious, despite the game showing Bureau as this ''Old Boys Club'' run by old men, the FBC's elite armed force ''Rangers'' has both men and women in their ranks, but ranger in-game models are all male, it's baffling to hear women's voices coming out of male bodies.Aswell as, despite seeing FBC having a gender diverse workforce across it's various sectors, departments and ranks, all the dead bodies in the game are only men."

273,Muyrka,"Apr  7, 2020",8,"High quality adventure shooter with very unusual and gripping setting. Stories are fantastic, acting - superb.There are some glitches here and there, respawning enemies, way form respawn point to objective is a pain and the most annoying feature - inability to change difficulty settings. It would be 10/10 for me if not for hardcore fights.I was frustrated to a point of dropping the game several times, because bosses are so very annoying."
274,CoreGamer1408,"Jul 13, 2021",9,"Free drop from Epic games and oh boy the PC version is actually optimized and runs well unlike the PS4 version. The fun gameplay reminds me of PSI Mindgate Ops dialled up to the max. Story is a whole load of weird, but in a good Twilight Zone sort of way. Looking like 30 FPS on PC. The loading times suck on both PS4/PC. The combat is a lot of over the top spectacle effects. So it can become a visually messy on screen. So expect a few cheap deaths from time to time due to not being able to see at all. I really had a lot of fun with the PC version for sure with the game play and story in general."
275,ImperialKnight,"Jun 13, 2021",10,"This game is like an 8, but gave it a 10 to balance out the negatives scores from people who want story delivered to them on a platter. Control delivers the story in a classic ""Show. Don't tell"" manner, which is apparently too difficult for many people. The world building results in huge potential for games based in the Alan Wake/Control universe. The game play is decent, but minor problems prevent it from greatness. For example, there's not way to tell if an enemy has spawned or snuck behind behind you, and there's a lack of feedback when you take damage, which all results in a lot of unnecessary cheap deaths."
276,StoiaAlex,"Apr 24, 2020",7,This was a wonderful random discovery for me.Very fun to play with a very interesting story that is not superficially constructed -if it wasn't for the mysterious plot I would have find it boring eventually -And for my surprise the game's fighting mechanics almost tops mass effect's. And this is maybe its crown!
277,greenisgood,"Jan 18, 2020",7,"TL;DR - A fun and unique experience story wise, people familiar with the SCP Foundation will enjoy this a bit more than the rest. A good part of the combat mechanics are innovative and well executed, but it lacks a little polish and optimization in the same department. Main Questline goes for about 14 or 15 hours give or take your difficulty level, is a good experience at full price an even better one if you purchase this on any kind of sale. Hopefully Remedy will take in all the feedback and make a much more Optimized and Balanced experience in the Sure to Be Sequel to CONTROL. The GoodJesse grew on me through out the game. Being privy to her thoughts really endeared me to her and although it is not a new aspect from a character development perspective it is well executed and works to the game's overall experience. The weirdness of the story really vibes  in tandem with her character and the backstory given to Jesse. Campaign Length is just right since it is pretty much a one track story and does not over stay its welcome with padding and or artificial stretching. Combat mechanics were really fun Launch and Levitate are the primary ones you will use the most and everything about it from the animation to the utility of it is very satisfying. The guns though not the most versatile helps fill the gap of the ability cool-downs and add a little variety throughout the game. The Ability Tree and Mod Systems also help give you an extra edge during combat, not a whole lot in the case of the Ability Tree but the Mod Systems really enhance the experience. The BadA lot of optimization and finesse was needed to make this game reach the Legendary status it really deserves. The Ability Tree for starters needed a good bit of tweaking since other than Launch and Shield ability almost everything else is near pointless; Life Bar, Ability Bar, Melee Combat is barely effective even after maximizing and Modding them.Couple this with unbalanced and jarring difficulty spikes the game will really drive you on edge, add in a little bit of imbalanced save points to the mix and this game's novelty and refreshing nature drains itself out of you real quick at times. Even the Mod Systems seems so restricted in comparison to all the Mods you receive during you playthrough for both your guns and abilities. At least 4 or 5 slots each would really do wonders to the experience especially for your Abilities since the guns are rendered ineffective in lot of firefights once you pass the 3 to 4 hour mark.You have to really learn quick that Launch ability is your Primary Weapon over the actual Primary/Secondary Weapons that you equip, I spent an ungodly amount of time on the Salvador fight since by that time I had not yet figured out that the game wants you to use Launch more than your guns and not the other way around. All in all even with it's faults the game is greater than the sum of it's parts and the experience on a whole is quite satisfying. But the game really borders on making it near impossible to overlook all of it's flaws. And hopefully Remedy will take in all the feedback and make a much more Optimized and Balanced experience in the Sure to Be Sequel to CONTROL."

However, if I really want to understand the story, I have to collect a large number of records things. The story is not easy to understand, and even a little confusing. The map design is complex and the goal is lack of guidance. The graphic performance of the game is very excellent.

280,defix,"Dec 19, 2019",7,"Overhypted.Mediocre gunplay, sub-par AI/boss design.Looks fine, has good RTX support, all in all even in the graphics department its not a game of the year contender.Combine that with the fact that they took the EGS money and still want full price for a fairly repetitive and short game 7/10 might actually be too high. Then again its a single player, no MTX bs, complete game with very few bugs... so. If you can get it on sale for 30 or 40 bucks its completely worth it.Full price, you can get better games for the money. But that's subjective, I guess, when someone is super into the story its probably worth full price as well."
281,TwoBe,"Jun  5, 2021",6,"If you are into puzzles this game is for you, but not for me. They give you less to nothing explanation on what needs to be done and that turns the game frustrating and boring, it's amazing the amount of people who had to turn to videos on YouTube to solve the puzzles. My job is solving other peoples problems, in short puzzles, and doing the same thing as I would do in my job to have ""fun"" I wouldn't consider it ""fun"". The map sucks | got lost so many times that it was a pain trying to find the places and people. The game mechanics are fine and the story seems alright but I had to drop it for Gal Gun Returns. By the way, Gal Gun is incredibly funny, I do recommend that one."

283,ShaamaanPL,"Jul 15, 2020",8,"While the game certainly has some issues and oddities, it's got some of the best RTX implementation on the market and a very peculiar atmosphere. I'd recommend playing for the atmosphere alone, which is sublime.That said, I didn't like the difficulty curve - basic grunts and mobs are very easy to take out, but named enemies can deal surprising amounts of damage very quickly if you're not careful whilst having a huge health pool themselves. The game also lacks a New Game+ mode - it'd be great going back and revisit some of the missions without worry about getting your gear and upgrades again (and starting a new game == clearing out the save file). The final ending is also a wee bit lacking, with the last boss being somewhat uninteresting and not really giving too much closure (yes, I understand there are DLCs already made and planned and you can kee pon playing after the end but still).Still, it's hard to hate the game when so much care had been put into making the game world feel almost life-like in visual presentation. It... probably won't age well (photorealistic visuals tend to age poorly), but right now? On a 2070 Super with RTX and DLSS this thing rocks."
284,MaxmilianKohler,"Jan  7, 2021",7,"Glad when the game was over. Had/has plenty of promise, but needs many improvements. Coming recently from Mass Effect Andromeda, that game actually has many similarities to this one. But as much criticism as that game got, this one is definitely worse and more flawed. Camera/FOV has issues, interacting with objects is bad, menus aren't well implemented for PC. The hitboxes aren't great. And the enemies are pretty dumb. They don't shoot at you much of the time, but then you randomly take a fatal or near-fatal hit from an often unknown enemy/source. The three issues of menus, object interaction, and hitboxes all seem to be due to the game being designed for consoles, including things like auto aim. They purposefully added flickering (game effects, and menu flashes white to black), which is just horribly unpleasant. The dynamic lighting transitions are bad. Global Reflections have issues, and are better turned off. The Ray Tracing stuff is super overhyped. It's largely preference yet a huge FPS demand. Objectives can often be extremely obscure/esoteric. And navigation needs improvement. It's so bad to the point where I just ignored a number of missions because I'm not just going to wander around aimlessly trying to find the objective. And you can't get them while doing other things – you're either locked out from the areas, or the thing doesn't exist till you get the mission, and they're given once you've already cleared the huge area, so you'd essentially have to go look through the whole thing again. There are way too many item pickups that you constantly have to open your menu and compare stats. Much fewer pickups with greater differences between them would be vastly better. Not a fan of how they made things that would typically be passive achievements in other games into a mission system. It seems too grindy and ruins immersion. The other guns you get have some nice ideas/uniqueness but they're fairly useless and rarely better than the default pistol. The progression seems poor and I would highly recommend using a trainer to progress much faster and start enjoying what the game has to offer much sooner. Really abrupt ending. There were multiple other missions available, various areas still untraversed, and no particular clue that this mission would end the game. With the DLCs/Ultimate Edition it feels a little more complete."

291,Drezor,"Feb  5, 2020",8,"Finished the game the other day and feel like I had to register and leave my thoughts on it. Despite hellishly boring action part of the game even with all those paranatural powers until you get one specific that make you feel more like a God, what makes it bearable and story that focuses rather on the world of the game than key characters (everyone forgot word ""balance"" apparently), I'm gonna rate the game 8/10 due to creativity put into all those OOPs' effect, Threshold kids cartoon + live cinematics - actor playing Casper Darling was just perfect + environment destructibility. And at some point, when I stepped into Ashtray Maze with janitor's walk-man, I kept asking myself again and again: ""Why the hell doesn't entire game look like this? This is just epic"". So, I'd say Remedy need to remind themselves how to keep balance between game aspects, cause the game could be much much much better than it is. It's still good enough, though"

Combinations, powers, modes and everything ties in so well with itself.-RTX grapichs make this game a dream-mode.. okay maybe not that far, but it's SUPER amazing seeing RTX do its thing and this game does that system justice!-Voice acting for Jessie when she's speaking to other characters seems bland, but is, on the other hand, very lively when speaking with Polaris.-Photomode CONs:-Repetitive gameplay, while the story does a good job of driving you forward, the enemies you encounter does get a bit bland as you progress, but never truly reaches the point of being obsolete. Conclusion:Control is absolutely a game I'd recommend, especially if you wanna see what RTX can do. With it's paranormal story and progression it leaves you curious for more, but never leaves you feeling like you can't take a slight detour here and there to see what else is shaking in The Oldest House. The combat system is really amazing and solid. And if you so desire, there's different challenges you can undertake with the jukebox.I have yet to encounter any serious bugs or glitches. only memorable one was when Jessie got cockeyed...

El sonido está muy bien en todos sus aspectos. Y, al menos en mi recorrido, solo he encontrado bugs menores. Por todo ello, sin duda es un juego que vale la pena.

There is a lot of backtracking and killing hordes of the same enemies over and over again, but the game offers you some decent skill trees as well as supernatural abilities that help you to kill all these bizarre things. The plot is also decent - if you liked Alan Wake then you should be satisfied. There is not much of a twist here but it's also well-made like the core gameplay elements. In general, if you happen to stumble upon this game on some kind of sale, just buy it if you like such kind of games.

310,abhishekcal,"Jun 10, 2021",10,Has to be the best game I have played in recent years.Lore is just amazing and setting is beautiful.
311,harmit900,"Sep 25, 2020",7,this game is great but can be better if it had  some beautiful enviorment like grass blue sky and pools chandelier 5 star hotel instead of boring office story is emotional and really good characters were also good and if there were more awesome weapons or gadgets it can be more cool game
312,nicksiciliano,"Aug 23, 2020",7,"Control has fantastic fluidity, shooting mechanics, and ray tracing graphical achievement. Looking forward to what 505 games has to offer"
313,Zavan,"Aug 23, 2020",8,"The story and the script are fantastic. From the beginning, you connect with the main character and despite all is confused, you accept this new reality. The main story is short and there are not impressive bosses to defeat. There are few weapons and abilities and the enemies are very repetitive that in some points it gets tedious. I strongly recommend this game because there is anything similar to the story and the way it reveals the events that happen before the main character arrives."
314,hertzian68,"Sep  2, 2020",5,"Good graphics, although the whole game is pretty easy to render and drab office space etc No reason it should be so hard on systems tbh Remedy must have got money from Nvidia.Atrocious map that is largely useless when you are talking about 3d levels and finding your way to some hidden places, very easy to get lost in this endless office space. This is a story about black magic used by organizations for control or slavery of mankind. The so called checkpoints if you notice are just black magic circles except technological but tech worship and satanism are two sides of a single coin really. See all sorts of government programs, military, police forces like the FBI, social revolution etc and you will see this sort of black magic performed publicly with tech and its army of jargonists with degrees, in it's deepest you will have real satanism on kabbalistic lines. This just attempts to bamboozle people into thinking, hey it's funny and weird so it must be good, nonsense. Software like this is mind control programming. Annoying mumbling type of narration and the lead character is sjw to the core, as a christian it's also pretty offensive using the Lords name as a swear word but we live in ""modern"" wink wink times of the cursed ones dominance, the kabbalists.  Get this at a 100% discount. Speaking to that Remedy obviously has writers who are kabbalists and who are into the whole mkultra monarch mind control(which is alan wake's condition btw, probably based on the real stephen king, not his real name btw) that is based on it, among other terrible things. It's good for a playthrough but gets kinda boring tbh, the two dlcs are nothing different, same stuff just more of it. No replay ability.  I thought the Fra Mauro reference was apt, this was mentioned in the ""something happened on the way to the moon"" by a toothy brit-commie woman who was part of long range agitation in the perestroika deception phase of the other major kabbalistic pillar of communism vs. central banksterism/monopoly megacorps. The synthesis of the two by the evil people of antichrist. She mentions a supposed monk, Fra Mauro, who supposedly sat in a cell and drew a map of the ""real"" world which seems to be close to what they present us with as an accurate ""map"" today, subtle messaging indeed. In game this accompanies a lunar lander film set,  again subtle indeed lol There is a remedy for remedy games."

318,Rcmorr09,"Jan 21, 2021",7,"Combat can be a blast but it's repetitive and gets old at times. Graphics are top notch with all the fancy RTX features and the story is fine but not great imo. The game is a solid 7-8, I went with 7 as I encountered a few technical errors(crashing at certain points over and over) but without the frustrating crashes I might have given it an 8."
319,LeoCoelho,"May 22, 2021",7,"LER EMAIL EU LEIO NO TRABALHOAcabei de terminar o jogo e confesso que sinto um misto bem grande de coisas legais e ruins, eu sou fã do jogo Alan Wake e achei bem memorável na minha opinião, Quantum Break achei bem mediano e Control, é aí que as coisas começam a dificultar, pelo menos para mim. Eu olhei outros reviews e vi pessoas gostando bastante do jogo por coisas que eu totalmente não gostei, a história é legal, quando não te coloca pra ler inúmeros documentos, isso é massante demais na minha opinião, porque acho que uma produtora como a Remedy teria a capacidade de colocar um lore mais completo que não fosse de forma para segurar um botão e continuar lendo o conteúdo e acredite a ambientação do jogo é extremamente boa, com jogos de cores e luzes que fazem a gente realmente elogiar o que esta vendo. O gameplay é onde eu consigo elogiar facilmente o que joguei, tava pensando em dropar o jogo sem finalizar, mas quando destravei todos os poderes da Jesse eu me sentia simplesmente o pica das galáxias, a forma de se jogar é facilmente o que eu mais gostei no jogo. Bem como falei acho muito dificil dizer se Control é ruim ou bom, acho que depende muito do quanto e o que você procura no jogo, mas por ora posso apenas dizer que não me arrependo de ter comprado."

323,Living_Table,"Dec 31, 2020",5,"First off I would like to say that if you are a casual gamer or someone who gets frustrated easily do NOT play this game. 1. The storyI feel as if the story is good in concept but bad in execution. Believe me it is a cool concept fighting a entity that comes out of nowhere that could end the world, but I feel as if the story is just boring and confusing. First you are thrown into the story without any background information. One of the reasons for the confusion is that the game reveals the story through time, which I think is cool but, I feel as if you are doing nothing some of the time and then all the sudden have to fight a boss or go on some extremely   long quest to get something done, when so story can be revealed instead through cutscenes or shorter quests instead  of  long ass tasks that can take sometimes 2-3 hours each. 2 The gameplay It is very cool but can be bogged down by the fact that it is so repetitive. One example of this is the combat. Cool at the start of the game, but extremely boring at the end. I have played through most of the story and I can say that fighting at the end of the game is what can I throw at them that does the most damage. This is the case because at the end the gun you have is complete garbage (the base mode at least) without damage upgrades. It can take up to 4-7  clips to put down one single enemy (even with the Max damage upgrade) which I think  is unacceptable.  Also the missions are vague as hell. It could tell you to go in one room and then the objective be in a other room. I understand if they wanted to promote exploration of your surroundings but come on I have spent probably three hours just looking for things that could be marked with a beacon or some tracker instead of just telling what room it is in. The quests especially the side quests are one of the most repetitive things in this game. I wouldn’t even recommend to do the side quests unless they give you new abilities, Because they usually give ass rewards for doing something that could take up to an hour. The side quest especially Aties usually involve you going to the opposite side of the map to clean up something or kill enemies. The main quest are ok but I think they could be shorter and split up into smaller quests. Considering that they can take up to hours at a time. In conclusion I think the schemes gameplay is cool and innovative but it’s held back but it’s repetitive gameplay, Bath level design, and the quests feeling like they are too  long or useless.3 The enemiesI think the enemies that you fight are cool but I will say again that it is repetitive as hell. Some of the enemies that you encounter especially at later stages in the game can have insane amounts of health and like I said earlier during the end of the game it feels like you just have to throw things at them to even do any damage considering your gun can be almost useless against them especially if they have a Shield . Also I hate it when randomly enemies will Spawn and when I’m just trying to do a mission and have to kill them instead of just progressing. 4 Map design I want to say that the map design in this game is probably one of the most confusing things I’ve ever encountered in a video game. Like I said earlier it is too confusing to simply go somewhere because it is usually blocked off and you have to find some out of the way area to get even passed. Also I think the quests markers are probably one of those **** things in this game it can tell you that it will be in one room but be in a completely different one. In conclusion the map design tries to make us think outside the box to solve solutions but I think that it hinders the gameplay and instead of doing it any good. 5 Conclusion In conclusion I feel that this game could be one of the greatest games of all time if they fixed the map design,  the repetitive gameplay and The overall boringness of the story."
324,Yustan,"Apr 11, 2021",9,"SAM LAKE - ГЕНИЙ На первый взгляд кажется, что всё происходящее в игре,  - бред сумасшедшего (и в какой-то степени эти люди будут правы, ведь многие гении немного поехавшие :)))) ), но когда ты должным образом во всё разберёшься, ты будешь поражён невероятной проработанностью этого мира, связующего во едино многие игры remedy. Правда способ познания тайн в этой игре очень субъективный. Большинство информации находится в записках, которые большей части игроков просто не будут интересны (+ в игре нет русской озвучки, что утомляет игрока постоянно читать субтитры и тексты). Да даже когда ты их прочитаешь, то фиг ты сможешь собрать всё единою картину самостоятельно (я сам воспользовался Ютубом и мягко говоря афигел от всего этого).Но про лор и историю мне говорить незачем, если хотите можете сами поиграть или посмотреть разборы на Ютубе (Likoris отлично всё расставил по полочкам).Что касательно геймплея, то я полностью удовлетворён. Боёвка простая и ненадоедающая, но тут главное другое. Практически полная разрушаемость в кооперативе с достаточно хорошей оптимизацией (моя 1660s тянет на предмаксималках в 1080p и примерно 60fps) раскрашивают геймплей в совершенно новые оттенки (в прямом и переносном смысле). Ох, как же весело было убивать этих дурачков,  попутно разрушая всё на своём пути. В общем и целом, если вам интересны игры Remedy и запутанный, сложный сюжет с интересным лором и историй, то вам однозначно сюда. Если же вы больше предпочитаете ПИУ ПИУ, то решайте сами."
325,oxlhyxx,"Jan 16, 2021",9,非常棒的遊戲，主線很好玩 操作很新穎但是經過已經完成的地方 又會重複產怪物，很拖台錢
326,Ugh_Its_Angel,"Feb  8, 2021",4,"Repetitive gameplay, awful story, awful dialogue, buggy, pretty graphics, lots of running in an ""open-world""(You know the types of games that are story-driven and linear but have a large open world with absolutely nothing in it, and its a chore to run to one end and the other, this is one of them). The game doesn't tell you what's going on and expects you to care about what's happening, for hours. If I had less of a brain and could just state at a screen without asking ""Why am I here?"" while my spit drips into my slobber pan in my lap then I could see how ""interesting"" the story is. Maybe I should huff paint before playing all video games."
327,apeot2002,"Jul 15, 2021",9,"Buy it, play it. Control is drop dead gorgeous, sounds great and is always fascinating. The ride won’t always be buttery smooth, but you’ll never use more than the edge of your seat."

329,Sk1pe,"Feb 26, 2021",8,"Игра не плохая, но имеются проблемы с сюжетом. Сюжет очень непонятный и что бы его хоть немного понять нужно читать записки итд. Графика в этой игре очень хорошая, если вы обладатель видеокарты RTX то вам крупно повезло. Отражения выполнены на потрясающем уровне. Каждый предмет в этой игре физичный. Разрушения в этой игре на очень хорошем уровне. Есть проблема с ориентированием, как карта которую можно открывать на вкладке очень плохо сделана и иногда не понятно как пройти в нужное месть.Подведем итогиПлюсы: Потрясающая графика с RTX и очень хорошая физикаМинусы: не очень понятный сюжет и проблемы с картой Рекомендую ли я вам ее купить? На этот вопрос сложно ответить так как не всем понравится ходить по темным офисам, но я получил огромное удовольствие пройдя эту игру."
330,hexava6294,"Apr 15, 2021",0,"It was a bold decision to give the main character no personality and a haircut indicating she would like to speak to the manager. Perhaps in some future DLC, the protagonist will make a decision not motivated exclusively by the men in her life. Perhaps we'll even see a bit of character development. Hopefully not too much, though. It's unclear if 505 Games is just incapable of creating a single interesting, believable, or remotely human character, or if the studio is just plain old sexist, giving their female protagonist no interiority or development and relegating her to the role of a cold exposition machine who exists to serve other characters."

332,SpiderSucc,"Jun 10, 2021",8,i just got this game free on the epic games store and i can see why this game has so much praise its a good game some flaws is with the first boss he will dodge almost all your telekinetic attacks no matter how close and he can be a pain in the ass to shoot with the service pistol and with some enemies in the game it seems they become supper accurate when your low hp even if your moving and I don't really like the health orb and control point thing to get more health because enemies drop so little orbs you'll loose more then you get sometimes but those are minor pet peeves I've only played up to the beginning of the directorial override mission but I can see myself finishing the game because its just a good time overall and I would recommend this game who like these types of games

335,CheekyBeef,"May 24, 2021",10,"This is a 'perfect' game for me. It is not overly ambitious with what it aims to achieve but of what it does try it does without any flaws. The story is intruiging, unsettling and is an effective vehicle for pushing the player toward the core gameplay which consists of stellar exploration and combat. You are rewarded for investigating every nook and cranny with secret ability points, mod upgrades and lore-building media. Abilities and gunplay are simple but highly polished and allow for a variety of playstyles which keeps things fresh for 30-40 hours of high-action gameplay. One particular achievement is in the physics - impacts, explosions and projectiles are fantastically 'weighted' and are exceptionally satisfying . Sound accompanies the tight gameplay with an equally satisfying feeling and although the score/soundtrack is quite subdued, it picks up in key moments with great effect - such as the wonderful ashtray maze. Finally, the visuals. This is one of the very few games where I have been compelled to use the photo mode. The brutalist architecture and Kubrick-esque geometry is highly evocative and frequently jaw-dropping. If you are a fan of action games this is one you should not miss. Simply brilliant."
336,greystrange,"Jun 24, 2021",6,"Woke game with a few interesting mechanics and some lore.As a game developer, I'm glad to see that skills weren't as dumbed down as in the most of the games, and they allow some interesting interactions, overall they fill pretty organic and fluid in the battle.Shooting feels heavily impaired, even with a few variations of the gun. Mods are simply boring and not powerful enough at any level. I mean, realism is great, but I've rarely seen situations where I'd use anything but sniper mode for long-range targets, everything else dies much faster from the skills.Writing is disappointing, to say the least. It's some ""young-adult novel"" level mixed with fanfic about SCP foundation. Epilogue is really empty.Replayability is non-existent, repetitive tasks are getting boring even during main campaign. Wokeness level is annoying. All positive characters are female, all antagonists(and looks like all enemies at all) are male. Guess who's dying in all side quests? You've guessed right.Overall I'm not disappointed about time spent, but I've played it only because it was free on Epic, to see skill mechanics."
