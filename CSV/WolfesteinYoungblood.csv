1,markbrak,"Jul 27, 2019",0,"Expected Doom. Got a bad RPG shooter that seems written by committee. Got this game for free with my video card, and I feel ripped off. Worst Wolfenstein game BY FAR. Very Very Bad."
2,PhatMonkey,"Jul 28, 2019",0,I hardly ever leave reviews on Metacritic but I love the Wolfenstein franchise and it has been totally destroyed with this boring RPG annoying trash....
3,Shnnji,"Jul 27, 2019",3,"If you call this game a spin off, you can spin my **** middle finger inside your ass, this game is so **** boring i brought my pal and we abused that cool pep system they implemented trying to speedrun levels just to get hit by lvl barrier, then i just dropped it and went to watch the ending on youtube to be even more dissapointed. if you absolutely hate grinding and lame hp bar rpg system go play previous games, don't waste your time playing this half-assed product. Shooting and level design are good though so i give it a 3."
4,FoeBus,"Jul 28, 2019",1,"This game is a combination of pure misery and lack of total understanding for whole concept of this so far good reboot iof series. It is so dull, that consideration of refund is pretty much clear to anyone who actually played the former titles and at least have some sense for aesthetic side of the game design. The twins, who are supposed to replace BJ in his post of ""bad ass Nazi-killing monster"" are the most annoying thing since the invention of allchat in CoD series. It tries to be funny and gore at the same time and it totally fails. The whole plot is stupid as hell and beside new enemies and better guns, there is hardly anything else to pick up, because every single minute spend in this game is like putting salt in your eyes. I will save some time to all of you who are actually considering buying this game for whatever reason (playing co-op or slaying Nazis), it is DEFINITELY not worth the money."
5,NothingnessEFLC,"Jun 22, 2020",2,"After completing the game, I can say that it's garbage. RPG mechanics ruined the game. It's just not fun anymore. Either you grind or suffer. Storyline is a joke. Main characters are anti-charismatic, boss fight are pathetic and the game ends with a cliffhanger. Please, don't tell me, that Wolfenstein 3 is gonna be about this characters. If so, I am officially stop buying this games.2/10 for graphics and sound design"
6,Xiphiqix,"Jul 26, 2019",0,"Gold Bars as microtransactions, skins for money in single player.  Weapons lack punch, an FPS that feels like a greed grind. This is sheeplestein game in wolfenthesda clothing. If your a fan of the franchise prepare to be disappointed and taken advantage of."
7,visibledark,"Jul 27, 2019",0,"This game could win ""worst designed game 2019"" as well as ""butchered franchise of the decade"". No wonder there was no real marketing for this piece of s***!"

10,Gardarika,"Jul 28, 2019",0,"Mdaa...It's just a nightmare. Ghostbusters from the world of Wolfenstein............. I really wanted to write a humorous review,but it boiled. I don't understand why the main characters are teenage girls! Is the game such a target audience? I do not want to say that you can not make a shooter about teenagers with interesting characters,but there's just some absurdity. A team of three teenage girls exterminates the Nazis.One(black) teenage girl breaks and breaks all systems to Nazis and a game in every possible way hints that she is VERY CLEVER! SEE ,FROM THE GARBAGE COLLECTING DEVICE IS WIRE! Two sisters( the main characters) behave like children,clapping her hands,constantly joking is inappropriate and stupid,flashy in combat, some u like ""-Eee rock! Herl power! sister,you're so cool! Look! I'm going to smear that Nazi's head! Oh,I have his brains in my mouth! Hahahaha funny!""and of course the army killing Nazis.Do you know how they came to this? If verbatim ""-Pope is gone! Mom's not looking for him! Screw the ancestors! We'll do it ourselves! Ow! We have two exoskeletons in the attic especially for us and a lot of weapons! Screw the ancestors! Let's go kill the Nazis.""I'm serious.There's the early scene where the girls fly away by themselves by helicopter from parents and angry calls from parents to answer, "" Yes mom,I do not care,bye!I'm in France!""What strong and independent teenagers,I just can't! And the Germans are ""- It's only the girls do them! ow! How can you lose to the girls! ""In General, the problem of the narrative that we in a game about mass murder put the standard American story about teenagers who hang out and cool them.And they survive by the way! It's as stupid as if in the beginning life is strange-we played for Dunga in hell to solve their complex emotional problems. And I really don't know WHOMACHINE GAMES COME TO MIND THAT FANS OF THE SERIES WAITING FOR A GAME ABOUT TEENAGE GIRLS WITH THEIR PROBLEMS AND GIRL VESELUSHKI?!"

12,MegamanAT,"Jul 26, 2019",0,"I can't believe what they have done to this series! I was one of those stupid enough to buy it without reading any reviews. I was sure it will be the same like Old Blood, New Order and New Colossus -> Outstanding single player experience with a great story and a nice campaign. You will not get any of it. It's a stupid coop open world loot shooter where you now can upgrade your weapons... Biggest disappointment ever. Be sure to buy in directly on steam to get a chance for a refund. If you liked the previous titles of this series, don't even consider to buy it!"
13,VegasKeVa,"Jul 27, 2019",3,"- Do you have Waaaaaaay more money than brains?  You're in luck!  THIS is the game for you!  I bet you couldn't sleep very well last night, tossing and turning because you miss playing a microtransaction posing as a game!- Did you HATE New Order, Young Blood, Colossus and have been longing for a day without the fun game play and immersion those titles had? You're in luck!  THIS is the game for you!  You don't need immersion and fun in your games - that's so 2014-2017!- Were you looking for a game with good grafix?  You're in luck!  THIS is the game for you!   Yes, there is some lovely rooms you will have the chance to see over and over and over and over and over again!  Lucky You!  Variety is overrated anyway!- Do you want to play a game where you spend half your time trying to figure out if it is this gun or that gun you are supposed to be using on that approaching guy?  You're in luck!  THIS is the game for you!- I can tell by the look in your eye that you have been longing for cringy sister characters in your next game that have dialog so bad that it will make you say 'This is stupid' actually out loud?  You're in luck!  THIS is the game for you!  Who cares if it stupid and cringy - it has HER power!"
14,SaiyanPride89,"Jul 26, 2019",0,"This is just an expansion. But it doesn’t end there. It has micro transactions, buggy AI, boring plot, cringe dialogue, and finally the cherry on top. It went full SJW. From a veteran Wolfenstein fan, all I can say is don’t buy this garbage."
15,Trey333,"Jul 28, 2019",0,"Pretty terrible.  A very unenjoyable grind, with too many micro transactions.  Enemeies have large health bars, and the voice acting is terrible."
16,Adolfsen,"Jul 26, 2019",0,"I do not recommend this game to any Wolfenstein fan or any player of any FPS game in general. There are several reasons to why that is. Microtransactions are present, health bars make the entire combat boring, the two main characters are so annoying whenever they talk, you'll feel like giving them a tight hug around their necks, graphics somehow look worse in cutscenes than during gameplay, and you'll get called an incel if you dislike this game, because disliking a game that has a female protagonist is sexist apparently."

20,bartcbem,"Jul 27, 2019",0,"Not sure what I just played. It has nothing to do with what I love about good old Wolfenstein.It has micro transactions, sponge bullet enemies, terrible level design, abysmal save (or lack of) system and two caricatures as main characters. If this is a glimpse at the future of FPS gaming then its time for me to find another hobby. Very sad."
21,Gizilq,"Jul 30, 2019",3,"Почему эта игра плохая?1. Это не шутер. Разработчики, непонятно зачем, решили добавить полоски жизни. Причем они двух видов, и игроку постоянно приходится переключаться между дробовиком и штурмовой винтовкой. Нет драйва.2. Сюжет. Сюжета тут нет. Игра заставляет игрока проходить десятки пойди-убей миссий.Очень однообразных и абсолютно бессюжетных миссий.3. Героини. Они отвратительны. не потому что некрасивые, а потому что у них характеры гопников. Я не могу проявлять эмпатию к тем, чей образ основывается на тех, кто сидит на кортанах и отжимает мобилочки.4. Бусты опыта. Гениально! Плати чтобы не играть.Мне страшно за Дум.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sorry for Google translationWhy is this game bad?1. This is not a shooter. Developers, it is not clear why, decided to add health bar. And they are of two types, and the player constantly has to switch between the shotgun and the assault rifle. No drive.2. The plot. The game makes the player go through dozens of go and kill missions. Very monotonous and absolutely plotless missions.3. Heroines. They are disgusting. Not because they are ugly, but because they have Gopnik (a person of low social class that is usually dressed in sportswear and who lives in the suburbs. He is also very rude and can pinch your smartphone) characters. I can not show empathy to chav.4. Boost XP. Brilliant! Pay not to play.I'm scared for Doom."

26,ChocolateCZ,"Jul 26, 2019",1,"Firstly there is problem to invite/join your friend, Bethesda has some problem with this. Game is about grind with microtransactions. Bethesda did not show us some gameplay, because there is nothing to be proud on. Players will buy this game, because they think, game will be same as Old Blood, New Order or New Colossus, but game has realy nothing to do with it. Players must level their character, missions are bad. Story is maybe one good think, nothing else."

I don't care about the protagonists being women nor do I mind they have what some would consider SJW leanings.  My issue with this game is all of the bugs and glitches that for some reason Bethesda continues to get free passes when it comes to this garbage.  Also, don't get me started on the AI, grind fest, microtransactions taken to insane levels.  Please let this series take a long rest again and bring back with inspired writing not this pile of hot garbage.  We now know why Bethesda didn't advertise this game, pass or wait for a sale if they fix the bugs which I suspect they will eventually the game goes up to a middle of the road 5.0.  Wait for a deep discount unless you are a diehard fan that needs to complete their collection even then I'd wait until the first major patch."

42,amestars,"Jul 26, 2019",1,"I felt very sad because this game is very different from videos Bethesda is showing.As opposed to Wallenstein and 2, this one is genre is loot shooter.You see enemy HP bar and level cap, and the feature with Bethesda have not explained and shown until the release day. And more the game has micro-transactions heavily affecting on your game play. Arkane studio always have been though ""Narrative experience"" as most important.The studio seems to waste their most important the feature by them-self, which making them much more precious than other studios."
43,AceAscendus,"Jul 26, 2019",0,WTF? They turned a FPS game into some RPG hybrid abomination with predatory micro transactions...???!!!! What the HELL were they thinking? There are also a lot of glitches and bugs... avoid this trash game like the plague.

Developers become idiots when is realism put two fools who only can do is to wave his hands.

50,SRKNZ,"Dec  6, 2019",0,"Bad heaped on worse. Once I finally managed to overcome this things endless bugs its game play was truly, truly AWFUL. I have been playing games since Space Invaders, I'm a gaming veteran and I can say honestly this is one of the WORST games I've ever encountered. Its dismal on line focus is only matched by choppy idiotic game play that feels frenetic in a bad way. Its throw everything into a bloody blender and hope for the best. There's no strategy just appallingly crude run and gun. Just to make this mess extra extra awful you have parkour style segments that are just horrible. Some genius had the inspired idea of making some of it in the dark with you using a flashlight!!!! Sorry but F**K ME! To add to your misery the thing wont let you decide when to save and if you leave in frustration like I did before completing a level you have to START AGAIN!!! I seriously don't think I'll ever go near this franchise or Bethesda ever again. 0/10."

52,zNeverSleeping,"Aug 25, 2019",4,"Fiquei ressentido ao ler algumas criticas. Mas como gosto da franquia, e muitas vezes, por conta da raiva, o pessoal acaba se ""equivocando"", resolvi dar uma chance ao game, e... bem... Joguei pouco mais de 3h, o que não é muito, mas foi o suficiente. A gameplay, que é o aspecto mais impotante da franquia - e pra maioria dos games-, de forma geral, é bem fraco. Eles trouxeram uma mecanica de rgp que só serviu pra deixar o jogo mais lento - 12749812498 de tiros pra matar alguns inimigos. Não é dificil, só entediante. A IA do game é uma das piores que tive o desprazer de conhecer. Serio, nem jogos indie contam com uma IA dessas. O que compromete completamente o modo stealth. Os graficos são bons e a otimização é muito boa, como de costume. Mas nenhuma evolução realmente notavel do jogo anterior. Como não zerei o game, fica complicado falar sobre a historia, mas ao menos a principio, a caracterização das gemeas é de doer os olhos. Nada faz sentido, mesmo pra um universo como Wolfenstein. Enfim, em time que se ganha, não se mexe. No maximo, acrescenta."

55,dk12761red,"Aug 15, 2019",2,"Wow this is a great example of how to completely ruin a great franchise with one game. The characters are poorly written and even insufferable. It has nothing to do with their gender, I see people on here saying if you don't like this game it's because you're sexist. That is an not a valid defense of everything wrong with this poorly made cash grab, and anybody that says that is a moron who can't think of any reason why people actually should like the game. They act like 15 year old morons. I cannot believe that these are B's children. The combat is broken, because of this weird armor system you have to constantly switch between weapons in the middle of a firefight to match your ammo to the armor type which completely ruins the flow of game play. There are no checkpoints, if you die you redo the ENTIRE mission. And don't even try this in single player, you won't be fighting the nazis, you are fighting your terrible AI companion who constantly runs out into the middle of battle and gets killed, then you HAVE to revive them or you fail the mission. They will run right up to a heavy and get downed, forcing you to run up to the heavy and try to revive them while getting completely pummeled. They for some reason added looter shooter mechanics that force you to grind out these bland and repetitive side quests in the same areas over and over again. The only saving grace is the good graphics, but it's game play over graphics every time. This game is an easy pass. Even if it was free it wouldn't even be worth wasting the time on. Oh yeah I almost forgot they stuffed micro transactions into it, which explains why they made it grindy.."

62,catmorbid,"Aug  1, 2019",1,"Okay, new Wolfenstein game from Machine Games and Arkane - great studios, who have made great games, so what could go wrong, right? Well, let's start with the good stuff: It looks good, it runs good. Level design shows some promise, some nice verticality here and there. Surely the awesome gameplay from the predecessors makes it a great experience, and hey - optional co-op is always cool, right? WRONG! I don't know what kind of moron forced the people to make this piece of garbage, but this game is a great example, on how to butcher a great franchise, how to NOT design a game, and how to make your fans hate you. The story is decent, although there's much less of it than in the other games. Voice acting, Sounds and music are fine, but it doesn't really matter because the game itself will keep you too annoyed to enjoy any of it. Most missions are not really that interesting and most of the content is pointless MMO filler sidequest material. When playing solo, your AI companion is mostly useless, sometimes even a hindrance due to the ""shared life"" system, and could've really used some extra effort. E.g. is it too much to ask to command your AI sister to stealth kill that nazi while you deal with the other one? The game's by far worst feature is its utterly inane level scaling mechanics, which add nothing to the game, except complete shattering of the suspension of disbelief. The enemies are horrible bullet sponges made obvious by the floating HP bars, and highlighted by the stupid level scaling mechanics, where couple of level higher enemies suddenly become undefeatable gods, whereas their identical cousings a few levels below the player's are a breeze. The level scaling crap is completely artificial: Player gets damage bonuses as they get levels - but enemies scale with you equally! You have a few variations of each enemy type, e.g. nazi soldat I to nazi soldat IV, but it doesn't really matter, because they're level scaled anyway, and I didn't honestly see any difference in the different tiers - except maybe a cosmetic one. It looks like the level scaling crap was just slapped on top due to someone's late brainfart, because without numbers, you wouldn't even notice most of the time - except when the enemy is too tough and takes a gazillion bullets. Most of the game you're forced to repeat the same levels all over again, fighting the same enemies - except every time you level up, they level up with you again. It's an exercise in futility. Sure, the levels can be re-used, that's not the worst sin - people loved Dragon Age 2 despite its cheap re-use of everything ( I didn't, I think that game sucked). So if the rest of it works, it's fine. Sadly rest of it doesn't. Worst of all, the game's guns are now utterly garbage, thanks to the spongy enemies, and the stupid armor system where enemies now have different kinds of armor, and you need different kind of weapon to defeat them. This makes no sense whatsoever - since the soft armored guys really don't look like they're wearing anything but clothing. It's an immersion killer, and only leads to boring, frustrating gameplay. Whereas the predecessors' guns were awesome, here everything feels weak and pointless. It's like they took the worst MMO / looter shoter mechanics and slapped them on top of game that didn't need them. What's worst is they ruined the shotgun... No buddy, you just don't go and ruin a shotgun!! The game has a some progression mechanics, which are mostly fine, except the gun customization is also artificial and moronic. You basically choose from three types of parts, where one part adds accuracy, another adds speed and last adds damage. And it doesn't matter if you put a grip or a barrel, it all counts for the same stats, with a few minor differences, again completely killing any immersion one could theoretically have. I wouldn't seriously recommend this game for anyone. If you get it for 90% discount and got nothing better to do, then sure. But I warn you, odds are you'll get frustrated anyway and wished you spent that money on something less useless like a pint of beer or a fidget spinner. What a waste."

70,Agusboye,"Aug 18, 2019",1,"Bueno este es uno de esos juegos con los que aprendi a usar la computadora halla por el 98 con wolf3D y debo decir que si hiciecen un reboot de ese juego seria miles de veces mejor.Despues de haber jugado casi toda la historia en unas 5 horas (se softlockeo el boss final 3 veces seguidas y decidi dejarlo ahi)pros:ahora Bethestha puede decir que en realidad estan trabajando en el nuevo juego de wolfenstein porque a este se lo dieron al hermano de Tito que se dedica a contaduria y lo hizo en un fin de semana diponible mientras se hacia un asado Cons:-Mapa: empezemos por la parte de que estas en Paris/Francia y a lo largo de todas estas horas y lo unico que me hace acordar  a ese lugar es en realidad una vision distocionada del mapa Resistance de MW3 pero estirado por varias pantallas de carga que dura el youngblood -el sonido seria algo positivo pero mira vo que no agregaron ni mejoraron nada de la anterior entrega -LOS PERSONAJES o mas bien los actores de voz y los encargados de hacer los dialogos les prometieron 1 guiso con tal de que en 2 dias tengas el script hecho y los dialogos grabados el dia anterior a la salida del juego .Es lamentable lo que uno debe encontrarse despues de jugar en todas las entregas de wolfestein con un prota mudo hasta los ultimos 2 titulos y escuchar la voz de un tipo cansado de todo lo mismo, devastado por la perdida de todos los que lo rodean y roto por la guerra inevitable que siempre se le presenta, cada paso que avanza carga con la memoria de todas las personas que alguna vez le dieron una mano .Y en New Colossus es simplemente consistente este dolor cuando constantemente tiene los monologos internos con Caroline  encontrar a B.J Blazkowicz en un estado de seriedad constate le da vida y dureza al juego mientras que tenemos por otro lado a La-MaS-tUrRiTa con la hermana la ASHULAAAAAA cagandose de risa jugando a juegos de manos estirando y bailando en las pantallas de carga.Necesitando depender una de la otra cuando al contrario tendrian que tener particularidades por el modo de aprender que te muestra la cinematica del comiezo es lo mismo que decir que si le pones chocolate en polvo a la leche va a saber igual que si le pones cafe ... no es lo mismo y nunca lo va a ser Armas:agragaron 2 armas de mierda que no hacen ningun cambio significativo a la trama -Gameplay : repetitivo, pequenio, con pocas misiones las cuales se repiten y no tienen profundidad en la historia, aburrido , pocos secretos(estamos hablando de una franquicia que se jactaba en hacer paredes corredizas ) ,no evoluciono casi nada a lo largo de todo el juego tiene peque;as mejoras por la parte rpg pero eso es contrarestado por la pesima forma de adquirir experiencia la cual se basa en hacer objetivos carentes de significado real para la historia y matar nazis AHH y  el juego mismo tampoco te adverte cuando podia haber enemigos con niveles superiores al tuyo hasta que te los topas cara a cara o te spawnean por atras tuyo porque asi de mal esta codeado el juego. Lo unico que te detiene de ir rusheando al Boss final y a los intermedios es el hecho que hasta que no llegas a cierto nivel haces poco o nada de danio porque tus balas no son balas normales son balas imbuidas con tu nivel no es que simplemente son humanos NOOOOOOOO no se te ocurra que podes hacer que los enemigos sean simplemente personas con armadura NO estos enemigos son una esponga de tiros los cuales no podes 1shotear en casi ningun caso y no podes asesinar de manera sigilosa porque como dije antes te spawnean atras o tu bot camina en vez de agacharse. una de mis cosas favoritas en las ultimas entregas era el hecho de que enemigo que matabas podias lootear la armadura que tenian bueno ahora ya no ahora encotnras todo servido Para terminar: antes de que el juego saliera al mercado cuando salio el trailer ya me parecia medio medio el juego pero pense que iva a ser simplemente mi impresion ,po lo comun no les simplemente mi impresion, y me tildaron de machirulo machista salame inculto retrograda y conservador por parte de las  personas que me rodeaban porque no me convencia la idea de que las hijas de Blazkowicz estuviesen en un juego. Es mas no me convencia el juego en si ,gente joven no puede andar saltando feliz por un campode batalla donde se hicieron assesinatos en masa(pero sin sergio massa porque el amassa la masa con la masa que le da la masa qe amasa ) es casi un chiste de mal gusto no les tienen bronca ni odio a los nazis los matan porque si no hay una razon aparente que te lleve a odiarlos simplemente es el mando enemigo.Lo lograron los eliminaron el concepto de enemigo a los nazis por uno mas amigable ""malditos nazis"" . Eso es lo que repiten a lo alrgo del todo el juego entre chistes y carcajadas en una paris vacia e inerte de vida social. TLDR: es un juego hecho en un fin de semana con un buen motor grafico"

This is basically if Anita sarkesian wrote the game might as well call it cuckenstein now. Two of the worst t southern voice actors I've ever heard and the basically took all the women in the game and beat them with an ugly stick this is why Dishonored got cancelled as well after Dishonored black chick edition good job cucking out arkane

Lucky i din't buy this because i saw the twin in the trailer and it wasn't good enough for me to go for it.I don't mind linear game path as long as the game is engaging. Good story with meaningful dialogues and cut scenes are the catalysts that keeps me coming back for more until this YoungBlood came out. This game has micro-transaction ?! What the f is this bethesda jumping onto the ea bandwagon? I am out, Bethesda,for good this time. You haven proven to be easily swayed by SJWs. Very sad and disappointing!"
91,Avadon,"Jul 29, 2019",1,"A spectacular dumpster fire of a game. You can outright forget it exists if you were thinking of playing it solo, the AI actively sabotages your play, has no concept of stealth, can not be ordered around and immediately suicides during tough fights. Half your playtime will be spent trying to resurrect her. Just forget it. The trainwreck is completed by repetitive mission design, constant backtracking through the same poorly designed areas full of infinitely respawning enemies and a shocking lack of checkpoints that can cause you to lose 30+ minutes of gameplay if you die. Add to that the terrible boss fights and butchered combat pacing caused by the game forcing you to fiddle around with your weapons CONSTANTLY to exploit ammo type vulnerabilities, and you have a game that manages to ruin absolutely everything. Apart from the graphics I guess, although even they are nothing to write home about.I refuse to believe that this is the best that Machine games and Arkane could come up with. These are great studios. Not all their games have been flawless, but even in the mediocre ones it was obvious that at least they tried. Nobody tried or cared here. Let's hope this was the game that they assigned to their diversity hires to get them off their backs, while the main teams have been working on actual videogames. I'm willing to give them one more chance."

Even with a co-op partner by your side. And even then I might have missed something. There's more wrong with this game than what's right."
95,DrShepherdLIVE,"Jul 29, 2019",0,"This is copied from steam but it is point on so enjoy: After RAGE 2 Bethesda drops yet another stinker.Wolfenstein: Youngblood has so many problems I don't know where to begin. The game takes place many years after New Colossus and BJ Blazkowicz's twin daughters have grown up to be annoying brats. It's almost like the developers played way too much Life is Strange and decided that they want to introduce a Chloé-esque character to the Wolfenstein universe, but not just one but two! ""Awesome right, dude?"" ""F'yeah dude! Very awesome, dude"" Which brings me to the next issue: this is a coop game. A forced coop at that. Even if you want to play alone you will have an AI companion, who wouldn't shut up for 2 seconds. The main objectives require both you and your human/AI partner to be alive, so if your companion is stuck elsewhere, then it's tough luck.The game doesn't use checkpoints, but instead only saves your EXP and item progression.What does this mean? It means if you and your partner run out of lives (3) then you are sent back to the beginning of the mission.This can happen very often as AI tends to wander off and then get downed. If you don't save her in time, then that's -1 life even if you don't die. Sounds fun huh?Oh wait, but there's more!There's no pause option in singleplayer.Let that just sink in: There. Is. NO. Pause. Alright, but is the shooting fun? Yes, it is. Granted if you are on the same level as your enemies.Levels? What Levels? Oh, didn't you know? Youngblood introduces a tedious leveling system. Most story related activites are locked behind a level requirement, meaning even if you are very good at FPS games higher level enemies have so much HP and dmg it's not even possible to succeed. So have fun grinding the first few hours. And to top all that up the game has microtransactions/in-game store.Not much needed to be said about this. Overall thoughts? Game is crap, and after 2 crappy FPS games in a row from Bethesda, both containing microtransactions I'm seriously worried how DOOM: Eternal will turn out. But one thing is for sure: Bethesda ain't getting another first day buy from me. PROS - Graphics are great- No performance issues- Gunplay is fun as long as you are in the same level range as your enemies- Enemy variety is decent, with some new addtions (EG:Laserhund, Bombenhund) and some returning ones such as the Elite Guards- Level design is interesting at times, when you discover shortcuts and hidden areas. Compared to other Wolfenstein games, this one's level design is less linear and incorporates more verticality. CONS - Extremely annoying main characters, who act and talk like infantiles- Poorly implemented leveling system, forcing you to grind to be able to tackle specific objectives- Pointless collectibles, which require you to revisit older areas with no real pay-off- Forced co-op with horrible AI companion- No pause option- Very limited content, even for a 30€ game.- Microtransactions"
96,JeremyVT,"Jul 29, 2019",1,"Graphics are pretty good on ultra but still not 2019 good. The Story makes absolutely no sense, and is led by the main twin sister characters that just seem to chatter about killing nazis. Bullet sponge enemies and poorly designed health bars that are hard to read while your moving.It's a poorly written and designed game about a timeframe that doesn't exist, with long drawn out cut scenes that appear to be about absolutely nothing of value to the story.Luckily I got the game for free with the pur hase of a video card, because I would be rather upset if I paid for it. Let us not forget the micro transactions. It's an insult to injury in this situation. I'm gonna have to reccomend a strong PASS on this game, don't say I didn't warn you..."
97,Soup123,"Aug  1, 2019",1,"WOW! This is awful. Lets list some things: You can't save, and sometimes checkpoints can be half an hour behind where you died. If you're underlevel for a side quest, it is litteraly impossible to complete it. Someone thought it was a good idea to add bloody RPG elements into wolfenstein. You have to level up for some reason, guess its that sense of pride and accomplishment. Ever level looks the same. You visit the same level multiple times, sometimes instantly after the last mission. Enemys now respawn when you leave the area. The levels are small, and boring. The guns now feel clunky. The characters are awfully written and annoying as hell. The story is a waste of time. Sound bad? There litteraly isnt any good to this game. It's what I've listed for the entire 10 hours you'll spend before finishing it. Also you can't play single player. Well you can, but the AI is so awfully coded that you'll die over and over and give up. Should've bought the deluxe edition!Seriously, bethesda has completely fallen off.

No story worth playing for. No memorable characters. Awful jokes. Micro transactions! In fact the only thing that they did ok was the graphics which are essentially the same as the previous Wolfenstein. Don't waste your money on this trash. I have to wonder if Bethesda's intent now is to literally destroy their own company because in the last 4 years they have obliterated what reputation they had in the gaming industry. Is it the Shareholders that are responsible? Who knows? What i do know is you don't want to waste your money on this game.

Or calling Borderland a COD clone. This is a destiny sponge-shooter clone marketed using Wolfenstein name, it's a disgrace. Aiming don't do anything because they use WOW's HP system where aiming at head just do 2X dmg and not worth doing it (since aiming at body = less miss = more DPS). The game is WOW's level of grinding, this is likely to force player to buy level and item using real-world money through their in-game $hop."
107,ScienceAdvisor,"Jul 30, 2019",0,"This is nothing more than a lobotomized version of previous games, with a co-op design that will make boss battles the most cringe-worthy rage-quitting experience for Single Players due to a total lack of care on behalf of the devs.  The AI is so vapid it will walk the secondary character under the boss and just stand there, forcing you to do similar, die, and then respawn.  Of course that means having to replay the last 1-15 minutes of the game.  This was the only way they could make it take last 10 hours.  So at the end this appears to be a minimal effort mod of previous games as a cash grab to sell micro-transactions which themselves are underwhelming.  Avoid at all costs, even on deep discount. REMEMBER: Click on a review's name to see who is a shill handing out 10s and whom has been doing this for quite some time, and has no reason to lie."

The game has no pause, no map and has added unnecessary RPG elements on top of the game which totally goes against the spirit of the franchise.Story-wise, the game is absolutely doing itself no favours. The story is a pure cliche and the characters feel absolutely annoying.The game clearly has a ton of microtransactions coming in a single-player game which just infuriates me further.Single-player mode cannot be played offline and the co-op mechanics of the game simply don't work and are broken. You get stuck in a healing loop all the time and even worse your co-op partner so consistently bugs out that it is impossible to play it without getting mad.The game simply breaks all common design practices and checkpoints do not exist between levels, plus the ammo is severely lacking considering that enemies have changed into bullet sponges.In conclusion, do not touch this game - it is not worth your nerves or your money - it is a TERRIBLE game and its story does not do it any favours.

122,RustyCoin,"Jul 27, 2019",1,"Again, Bethesda failed big time. As Wolfenstein game it is very weak, very poorly made. I was expecting pretty same experience as it was with previous games. But in the end I was very disappointed. I paid for a fast-paced shooter, instead I got looter-shooter. Pros: Coop is funVery well optimizedNice graphicsSounds alrightBuddy pass (only one copy of the game required in order to play coop - deluxe edition) Cons: - 40% gameplay, 60% looting. As for Wolfenstein game, of course you're expecting some fast-paced gameplay, just running and shooting nazis all around you, but that's not the case with Youngblood. And it is one of major problems with this game - you gonna spend more time looting than actually playing/shooting enemies. This game is more like a Borderlands than Wolfenstein. You have to loot silver coins for weapon upgrades, skins and special abilities.- Bullet-spongy enemies. It seems adding RPG elements to new games has become new trend. It was the case with Far Cry New Dawn, AC: Origins, Odyssey (it looks like new Ghost Recon game also gonna be the same crappy way), Youngblood is no exception - we got some goddamn RPG elements - health bars, level and skill system. Which means if you wanna keep going with main story, you going have to farm side missions, in order to proceed, because with health bars now enemies got those little skull icons above their heads, indicating you are too weak to proceed here further.- Player has to constantly keep changing weapons, because with health and armor bars now, you have to use proper weapons in order to penetrate enemy's armor and kill them. And constantly changing weapons just ruins immersion for me. I remember in Doom and Serious Sam games (very similar to Wolfenstein, comparing gunplay), all you had to do was to pick your favourite weapon, make sure you got enough ammo and then just blast everyone in your way. Well, congratulations Bethesda, it seems you've managed to f**k this up with Youngblood.-Dumb and buggy AI. I came across some enemies that were glitched. I was shooting them and they just weren't responding to that, just walking as usual.-Microtransactions. Oh, what a surprise.... Maybe you will have some fun with this game at start, particularly if you're playing coop, but honeslty this could've been so much better. Instead of maintaining the basics of Wolfenstein's gameplay, they're trying to make this into looter-shooter. P.S. Let me just add this. I strongly believe that devs and publishers are doing this only so they could monetize new games later. It's because they want to implement loot-box system and microtransactions, they wanna force gamers to spend more and more money for some random, useless in-game loot (when new AAA games already cost 60-90-120 euros). That's why they're adding all these RPG features like in Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, Ghost Recon, Anthem, Division and other games. That way, they can justify all this loot-boxes nonsense.Ubisoft be like: ""oh look at AC: Odyssey, it's very grindy game, so we're just adding some ""time savers"" for a real money, just to make it a little bit easier for you."" EA by like ""it's not loot-boxes, it's ""surprise mechanics"", like kinder eggs, people love getting surprises."" Wolfenstein: Youngblood is perfect example of why gaming has been going downhill for several years now. No immersion, no interesting characters, no more great stories or fun gameplays. Only SJW bulls**t and political correctness, that's what we're getting in games now. FU Ubi, FU EA, FU Activision and FU Bethesda, ♥♥♥♥ing up gaming industry right now, and it just works..."

Walking around is confusing and time-wasting. Dialogs and characters have been written by teenagers for teenagers. Say ""cool"" again and I will shoot you in the face.

I am a fan of New Order, Colossus was OK (bad ending), had some real improvements but story was not as bad as this garbage. This is carbon copy of Colossus graphics and sounds and guns with almost NO changes. Intermission screens are CRINGY, screaming ""hell yeah dude"" after every kill is tiring and just why.... why make this game? Looks like Bethesda forced Arkane to make it. Characters are just bad. No personality. Game has weird bugs like black boxes on screen. And the ending is bad, made the whole story  pointless and rushed. Why Wolfenstein needs a RPG mechanics? Levels mean everything, higher LVL enemy means you are down by 1 shot.  Every damn game now is doing that. The most fun thing from New Order was dual wielding of guns... well that is gone here. RIP fun stuff.Killing animations are bugged too, and repetitive. Level design is bad, they repeat same areas. Even side missions are in same areas and break the ""open world"" feel that nobody asked. There are also NO checkpoints, you die = start over from beginning. AI sometimes just breaks, especially if you hide. Playing with friend is painful, animations are dumbed down.

140,Pasadena,"Jul 28, 2019",5,"Wolfenstein: Youngblood is extremely disappointing on many levels. I've completed the game twice, both times on the highest difficulty setting, completing 100% of side and main quests. [35 hours played | PC] The gun-play is probably Youngblood's saving grace; however, so many aspects with a lot of potential have been bastardised in the process of trying to force coherent game-play loops into the experience. The game whittles down to receiving uninteresting quests, going through the same areas ad nauseam and developing your character and their weapons. The only payoff is the gun-play, which can only last so long. Upgrades take far too long to acquire, relative to the length of the game; as the game becomes more interesting, mechanically, it becomes far less interesting, holistically. The plot is deeply uncompelling and most characters are quest-giving NPCs with very little literary substance to them. The main characters, Jess and Zofia, are lovable and goofy, although contrived at times, in an attempt to make them appear deeper than they are; overall, they're likeable characters, unless you expect them to be much more serious than the game takes itself. The ending of the game is shockingly bad, and really feels like a slap in the face; the game starts with a bang and ends with a whimper. The game features microtransactions, although they're fairly unobtrusive, given the experience. The real underlying issue exists with the live service model Bethesda, as both a publisher and a developer, seems to be pushing their computer games towards. Youngblood is no exception to this now-rule, and schizophrenic game design is abundant. Over the course of my 35-hour experience, I suffered some bugs which turned out to be fairly game-breaking and many which forced game restarts. The former comprised bugs which made characters extremely powerful or powerless, without good reason; the latter consists of awful audio issues, visual artifacting and crashes. If you're not hosting the campaign, expect some quite frustrating lag which will really hamper your experience. These issues may not be present on platforms other than PC. If you have a friend with whom you'd like to play this, I'd recommend purchasing the deluxe edition and taking advantage of the buddy pass system (allowing one to play the campaign without purchase), or wait for a sale if you intend to play it by yourself, or buy individual copies."

143,juliiouse,"Jul 30, 2019",3,"I love FPS games, but I really hate the new brand of ""open world"" FPS games which have flooded the market following the massive success of Borderlands, a game which was so built around the formula that it nailed it, leasing to other developers to follow suit.I dislike these games so much because they feel so dead. Progress feels non existent. After clearing an area, you will go back through it to see it teeming with the very enemies you've gotten rid of. The levels and story are replaced with generic ""quests"" with very little payoff and it generally lacks the spectacle seen in more story based games. In this sea of boring open worlds came Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014-- a game which wasn't afraid of using a linear level structure to set up spectacular set pieces, a harrowing, at times funny and interesting narrative and tight gameplay. This was followed up by the more B-movie style The Old Blood, and 2017's The New Colossus, which felt a bit flabbier, sacrificing the tightness of the gameplay for greater player diversity and a range of new scenarios, but it ultimately remained enjoyable in spite of a less engaging story. These games are great because you die relatively easy, but kill equally so, which means fighting off hordes of soldiers with dual wielded assault rifles feels tense but rewarding.And along comes Youngblood, a game which sacrifices basically everything that made Wolfenstein good to build a live service model.First off, the game is centered around Co operative play, something which I'm surprised about given the publisher Bethesda's infamous last attempt with Fallout 76. The co-op could have been fun-- it was in Return To Castle Wolfenstein-- but it is so poorly implemented that it feels like a waste of time whilst also being the core mechanic of the game.It baffles me that the best co-op model (a player dies and awaits the other player to leave combat to respawn) was perfected with Halo almost 20 years ago, but the god awful Revive Or Game Over system this game uses is still in place.The RPG mechanics have destroyed the enjoyment got from shooting. Enemies now have health bars and armour which must be chipped away at using different ammo types. They have levels which dictate whether you should be fighting them or whether they can one shot you, and they use up so much ammo that the game actively incentives not fighting in an FPS. Level gating is a serious problem to the game. Whereas previous Wolfenstein titles checked progression by how far through the game a player had gotten through the linear story and threw more complex challenges and diverse enemy types at the player based on an assumption of how good at the game they are, Youngblood has taken this linear model out and replaced it with random enemy levels.The story is far worse too. The main characters act like American fratboys, which is extremely jarring given that they are the product of a PTSD-harrowed war veteran and a Polish resistence fighter in a world occupied by a highly traditionalist ideological empire.The graphics are passable, and are about in line with New Colossus, but the game really doesn't nail the 80's look it tried to sell itself on.This is another miss for Bethesda. Avoid it."

146,AngryShark92,"Jul 30, 2019",2,"TL;DR - Wolfenstein as we knew it is dead, thank god I got this for free with an RTX GPU because it is worth about $10. + 80s themes & atmosphere+ Some good world design - Broken co-op system- Cheesy dialogue that repeats way too often- Bullet sponge enemies- Weapon-swapping galore- Integrated RPG mechanics need serious re-work- Micro-transactions do not belong in narrative-driven games- Lacklustre story- Repetitive and boring gameplay- Checkpoint system is terrible- Awful characters- Highly touted ray tracing features are not here- Just could not resist politics I don't know what to say, I loved RTCW, enjoyed 09 Wolfenstein, thought New Order & Old Blood were brilliant, and then we somehow just drove off a cliff at that point. I knew after the heavy-handed political themes from Colossus that this franchise would be rotten until another studio got a hold of it, but Youngblood wasn't even really that bad with political crap in comparison. It is just a boring terrible DLC that was sold for half-price of a full game. Positives, I love the 80s themes and the music that is sometimes playing in the background while I am searching for things, doing side quests, or just reading notes. I thought that that aspect, in conjunction with the 80s style world design really made me appreciate the work that went into it. That's about it. Negatives. Co-op system is a joke, I want to play these types of games alone so I opted to play with a bot that just stands there and does nothing but occasionally pull the myriad of conveniently placed two-lever apparatuses around the environment, give me health peps, and repeat the same cheesy dialogue every 1-2 minutes of down time. Makes me really invested in these incredibly written characters who were tolerable and humorous at times, in the beginning, but later I considered playing with voices off so my ears would stop bleeding. You know what else I find fun? Spraying loads and loads of bullets into enemies with a fully upgraded gun and run out of ammo before they die. In case, I didn't enjoy that enough, let's give them shields that are only susceptible to certain types of bullet fire so I can constantly change my weapons during fast-paced combat with a clunky as hell weapon-swapping system. Wait wait! There's more... Do you like paying for cosmetics? Especially where the ones that are potentially cool can only be bought with real currency? IN A NARRITIVE-DRIVEN, BASICALLY SINGLE-PLAYER GAME? Well, don't worry because the narrative is bad, but the MTX is a plenty. Also, don't confuse MTX (Micro-Transactions) with RTX (Ray-Tracing) because only the former is available in this game, despite what you may have heard. This game could have been fun, it could have had the gunplay of TNO and TNC with new forms of hybrid-RPG mechanics and really could have been a fun co-op experience for people to play with buddies to have some mindless fun, but this game literally screwed up every single good thing about it's two predecessors. The gunplay was a saving grace for Colossus, and the spongy enemies, weapon switching, and brain-dead AI companions ruined all that in a heartbeat. Without excellent gunplay in the current Wolfenstein games... What is there to stay for? The cringe dialogue? The ham-fisted politics? The micro-transactions? Forget it. This game should have never been released like this or by this studio... Wolfenstein as a franchise deserves a hell of a lot better than this garbage. All the critics giving this game anything above a 5, should have their credibility stripped... and to all of those on here giving the game a 10 because they believe it will balance out the zeroes... way to completely compromise your objective opinion on the game. If you were able to give this anything above a 5, I just have to ask... Did you start playing games in 2016? Did you play RTCW, Wolf 3D, SoD, 09' Wolfenstein, or even TNO/TOB? If you want to play Wolfenstein at its best, play RTCW, if you want updated graphics, play TNO & TOB. If you want to become a drone of today's current society, play TNC & YB. Congratulations on another game studio that would rather infect media spaces with their political agendas, instead of making a great game people can immerse themselves in to escape from all that garbage. This is a very soft 2/10."

You remember how people said to fallout 76 ""of course its fun in coop, everything is fun in coop"" well apparently Bethesda decided to put that to the test and they successfully made a game that is, in fact, NOT fun in coop. The story is bland and straight up boring and minimalistic. The characters feel like somewhere between actual characters and fun characters like you are used to from games like Duke Nukem, but its not quite either end it winds up just beeing weird. You have absolutely no connection to the characters and quite frankly they just piss you off. They game mechanics are so amazingly annoying, you need to constantly scan every inch of your screen to see whether there are any of those damn coins to pick up which not only puts an insane amount of strain on your eyes, it makes it straight up annoying to play. The next thing is the enemies, they implemented an ""enemy type"" system, basically meaning you have either fleshy targets, or armored targets, and all weapons do either one damage, or the other. So your shotgun is effective against flesh, the assault rifle is good against armor. Problem is, JUST that effect. You deal practically no damage to the other type, meaning there is no dual wield rampaging with the shotguns like you had in previous wolfenstein games, instead you kill 2 people, suddenly an armored supersoldat stand in front of you and you suddenly deal 0 damage and need to swap weapons right in front of him, likely leaving you dead or close to it. This system is so unbelievably half-baked its hard to put into words. Whats worse is that you don't really have story missions, they are just like all the other side quests which you have to do since the ""main"" quests are actually locked behind a level requirement, whoever had that genious idea deserves a high five. To the face. With a chair. Why? Because the side missions are so amazingly boring that you really don't realize you are on a mission when you do it. All the side missions make another bad side of the game painfully obvious: The level design.all. maps. look. the. same. My coop buddy and I literally had a moment when we could not tell whether we were in that spot before or not because all levels look exactly alike. Actually we had plenty of those moments. Wolfenstein youngblood is a coop game that it not just NOT fun, its a coop game thats a chore to play through.

166,ProfCrunchwrap,"Aug  7, 2019",4,"This game sucks. The gunplay is good, the first few cutscenes with the protagonists are pretty funny once they got to Paris, but their snarky little lines in game are pretty annoying. Enemies are bullet sponges so the stealth mechanics from the New Order, Old Blood, and New Colossus are pretty much non-existent. MTXs for a single-player game is an absolute joke and hilariously have you buying Nazi gold bars. The game feels like more of a chore to play than anything because of the grinding required to upgrade your weapons and abilities. The levels are pretty uninspired and mostly feel the same. The game is designed for co-op, which I haven't played yet and might be why I think this game is so bad, but honestly it's so generic and uninspired that I doubt it'll make much of a difference other than getting rid of the monumentally stupid friendly AI, and even that depends on which friend I'm playing with. As an aside, I see a lot of people in here whining about communist propaganda, which knowing how common reactionary politics are in the community, means saying that Nazis are bad and having female protagonists (gasp!). You would have to be completely politically illiterate to have such a braindead take. If you're out of high school then you're probably mature enough to see how embarrassing those beliefs are and can ignore them. We all know gamer Americans are the most oppressed group."

173,CDrew,"Mar 25, 2020",7,"I admit that this is a fairly mediocre game, but i must say that, overall, I kind of like the direction they went in. In my opinion, the gunplay felt a lot more satisfying than in The New Colossus, where I always felt that either enemies would die too quickly or I would get overwhelmed almost instantly. Here, however, the combat feels just about right. Weapons customizations and RPG progression allow for a lot of possibilities. In addition, I think that a change of tone was rather welcome, as Wolfenstein had changed very little since The New Order in 2014 (you can already see that it was moving toward a more open-world and exploration design in The New Colossus, but the mechanic felt half-baked there). In addition, hunting for collectibles is extremely fun as there are quite a lot of different types, which all give you new perspectives on how culture and social organization would work under a long-standing Nazi regime. The graphics are also really awesome and well optimized, even without the recently-introduced ray tracing feature. However, pretty much everything else is mediocre. The story ends abruptly right after it starts getting good. The protagonists and many parts of the dialogue are not that well written (it certainly feels like a downgrade from the previous installments). The quests feel empty and devoid of interesting parts. In addition, there is FAR TOO MUCH REPETABILITY here. You have to kill the same enemies many times over, and many of the quests will simply take you to the same areas over and over again. Not to mention that the story missions have ridiculously few checkpoints, which can be situated at really long distances from one another. Overall, however, I do recommend this game for people simply looking for some amazing gunplay and open-world shooter exploration. If your expectations for the story are sufficiently low, you will actually find quite a fun game here, especially if played in co-op."

Also whom are these people supposed to be the Bill and Ted of FPS??? Honestly are we all 14 year old half wits? I take it back this Is Duke Nukem Forever meets Bill and Ted with a sex change. I uninstalled this game because what should have been a simple fight with a boss became impossible because instead of my helper taking up and advantageous position across the ways and firing in burst to direct the enemy fire this way the back of the guy will always be to one of us and taking cover when he is facing you. This AI gets the bosses attention while running straight at me blowing us both up. then when i revive and run away from here to get a few bullets into bosses back she comes to and does the same stupid crap all over again.

They really should have priced this game the same as when The Old Blood came out since it reuses so much of the assets from The New Colossus. The buddy pass idea is nice but they are basically making everyone pay for it by overpricing the base and deluxe game.

190,CoreGamer1408,"Aug  2, 2019",3,Micro transactions in a paid SP again wtf!? Design a game to road block progression to appeal to the instant gratification whale crowd. So for starters this game is made for and targeted at the whales like Fallout 76 and not the average gamer. Ok if anyone has ever played random drop in and drop out public servers these two characters come across like some obnoxious loud immature teenage boys who just hit puberty. Yeah those types that everyone wants to avoid online and mute the mic asap. So the combat and mechanics are dumbed down Borderlands at best oh well. The maps and local trigger me back to  Wolfentsein 2009. So I might as well of play that game again. No obnoxious teenage characters. No micro transaction bull crap. No relying on other people or bots to do tasks. I think Bethesda can't make a good game anymore. I have a sad and bad feeling that Fallout 76 is making Bethesda good bank off the whales for such a low tier exploitative effort. Can't think of another reason to drop this Young Blood hot mess on gaming community. Well other than to exploit the instant gratification addicts aka whales.

192,Hack,"Jul 27, 2019",6,"A failed experiment. The RPG lite and open-world(ish) elements both hurt the game more than help it, and the addition of enemy armour types really killed the gameplay for me. Running out of the correct ammo would result in you having to shoot rubber bullets at enemies until they die, which felt like it took forever. Another major problem is the structure of the game, having a central hub where you get MMO style side quests just wasn't fun, often you'd be sent to an area you'd just finished, having to reclear it all to pick up some documents or whatever, which made the game feel very repetitive. Also, enemies will just respawn on you now, and areas will fully repopulate if you step out for a second to turn your quest in. And because you're constantly going back and forth to the hub you'll see a ton of loading screens. The game does look nice, run well and has solid audio though, which is to be expected from iD6. I also didn't mind Beavis and Butt-head (Jess and Soph), although Wolfenstein without BJ just feels wrong. Overall Young Blood just fails short, and everything new they tried flopped massively."

Stupid character design and absolutly awful storyline(which is just the reason to shhot that nazi bastards i guess). In oppoaite of this is tottaly awsome shooter mechanic and Great level design (tnx to Arcane Studios for that). And ofcourse good co-op expirience with halfprice cost making this game not bad at all."
198,cmfrip,"Jul 25, 2020",8,"I score this game at 7.5 given the great detail and the good gameplay alone(8 if you like Wolfenstein and shooters). but there are many design flaws - it is not perfect. It is fun though, and does have good gameplay - co-op works  well also. The open world opens the void to boredom however... There is so much creativity that has gone into this game and I could rate it up half a point just for that.  Arkane are almost certainly doing what they do best, like in Dishonoured with complex map design and meticulous detail to items , collectables etc.   Just as Machine games have done for the feel of the game.  Many levels benefit well from verticality. It is a deep shame that most of the collectables will not get any attention at all... This is Wolfenstein , an adrenaline fuelled frag-fest and there is no way to play recordings or read/narrative recordings/ texts without breaking up the game(unlike the division does)- even the music or audio logs are stopped short as you exit the journal - which is tragic!  (I played co-op and found it hard enough to find time to upgrade my character - let alone read and listen to the other media – there's loads of it!).  If I played single player(again)- I would definitely spend the time to soak up these assets.  This is another design aspect that has ruined other design aspects of the game. I get why some people complain about the way the humour manifests, but I found it amusing and liked how the game did not take itself too seriously - it was quite slap-stick- although the end boss fight leads to some pretty Sugar sweet dialogue that had me barfing - goes too far... The best it has to offer is where the comprehensive RPG elements add to your character and give more game play choices, Most importantly the fps action that comes from a Wolfenstein game. Oh also the Prey like benefit for choosing the right weapon with the correct armour type - its only half set here, but I got something from it.  Additionally, to the detail and presentation of the world, the map design seems decent, and explorable is rewarded. Some map verticality helps and the game certainly does not take itself too seriously either. The worst comes from poor implementation of open world, slow input and interaction at times(weapon switching and interaction as well as reviving), weapons being allocated to groups by default- so you have to select each via 1 key(not sure if work around?),  groups of enemies respawning on top of you, the constant need to pick up stuff that has respawned(you need thousands of this currency to make an impact! (although if you play with 1 or 2 guns, you won't need push too hard)), Quests leading you back and forth over the same levels, which have alot of items that you will need to resist picking up AGAIN. Also, broken and non-adaptive quest directions - You will need to pay attention else you will be wandering round for hours. End game has very little to offer also."
199,Sjalka,"Aug 26, 2019",5,"Something is seriously off with this game. While it is a fun shooting game .. the graphics are all over the place. Sometimes gorgeous visuals are replaced by absolutely TERRIBLE character models (especially the two protagonist models are ugly as sin - 2004 modelling detail) I do like playing with a friend - but sadly the game looks and feels like a cheap knock-off from the other Wolfenstein games. Oh, and the enemy AI is ... simple ... hardly a challenge other than being huge bullet sponges."

I got it with my free Xbox Game pass.And I have to say....I`m not sure were all the negative reviews are coming from.Maybe I missed something? Did It get review bombed on release? I am having an absolute blast.  It`s great fun to mow through the nazi`s with my dual machinepistole.The enemie variety keeps in interessting.  It feels balanced eneough were it is not easy..but I still get a nice sense of being overpowered (As I should with a game like this) I have encoutered no bugs.  My only complaint would be that the A.I. is a bit simple and my A.I.-Sister (I play offline) Is not very dependable. But that said.....I`m having fun. And I like the game.  Sorry for the haters out there ;-)I can recommend.EDIT: The combat is just very...very satisfying.  4 hours in and I just don`t get tired of it ;-)  It`s fun. Also the graphics are A-MA-ZING! I have a new GPU with Ray-tracing and boy let me tell you...this game look absolutely gorgeous! Settings maxed out to ""MEIM HEMEL!"" or something. Hahah, I loved that.It goes from LOW - NORMAL - HIGH - ULTRA - MEIN HEMEL!  in the graphics settings. Hahah.My german isn`t the best but I think it means something like ""O my god / Holy ****"

I REALLY don't get the hate.  If you look at the reviews, I think it was review bombed.  That many zeroes?  Come on, that is absurd."
204,Ge3z,"Jul 28, 2019",6,"Trust me. This is not SJW game. I do not like over the top feminism and this political agenda is not present in Youngblood. It is just a game with women as protagonists that actually happen to be kinda bland. They are goofy and you cannot describe them in other way because the player does not get to know them in any form due to short storytelling. Total cutscene time is 30 min and you do not hear them have any dialogue during gameplay either except ""let's kill those Nazis!"" etc. Gunplay is fun. Character perk progression is well adjusted. HOWEVER, weapon progression is terrible because you can begin to update it on level 25. I have 1/3 of the game behind me and I'm only on 20. Therefore I will be able to customize weapons just after I pass the first half of the game. Lame af. You cannot view awhole map, only a minimap is available. Executions should also have more animations because they get boring real fast. Youngblood is fun co-op experience but underdeveloped."
205,PaulV97,"Jul 31, 2019",8,"I think this game is a solid eight, so let’s explore the different aspects of the game.First, gunplay is the best in the Wolfenstein series, no doubt. Never before I had so much fun just mindlessly shooting nazis. Guns feel more powerful than ever, as long as you pair them with the correct enemy’s armor type. Ramming and hatchet throwing are really deadly this time around. You’ll use them a lot in combat. RPG elements are pretty fun, guns personalization is cool and the ability tree makes you feel more powerful with each new skill. Sound is top notch, guns sound great, and the synth wave songs that randomly play around the game world are excellent. About the game world, this time it has a semi open approach, and offers the possibility of a fair amount of exploration. Special mention to the artistic and level design of Neu Paris, most beautiful location in a Wolf game hands down, specially since graphics have been slightly but noticeably  improved since new colossus.The story is pretty short and it’s mostly foreshadowing for the next game, an absolute step down from wolf 1 & 2 campaigns, and almost on par with the old blood. I’m not saying it’s bad, at all, just not what we might expect from a full price Wolfenstein release, but then again, this isn’t the case. It opens some interesting doors for the future of the series, it features a pretty nice plot twist and a cool but bland villain. About the twins, they are a neat addition to the series, they are pretty fun and cool, even though they still need a lot of character development in the next game. It’s true that sometimes they are cringy as **** but that makes them real, dancing and teasing each other like two dumb normal teens.About the micro transactions, they don’t affect gameplay in any way. During my play through, I barely had extra money for cosmetic things, since I found myself expending a lot of in game cash on weapon upgrades. If you want to get them nice skins, you’ll have to either sacrifice firepower, grind a lot, or expend some real money. If the developers continue to support the game with new content for free, I’m okay with the approach, if not, I think it’s a pretty ugly move from Bethesda.All in all I enjoyed a lot my time with the game, and I played it alone, if you coop, I’m told it’s even better."

Playing this sort of game online with a random other player is going to ruin the discovery aspect and ability to be stealthy if that's what you want to do.  In the case of other co op games people generally run off, try to just leg it through the game or don't match the style of game play you are going for.  More often then not it's charging in 'Leeroy Jenkins' style!  Now I don't want to play the game on line as it should be so not to be pressed to not read the notes or other content to keep up.I think the game might have chosen a bold new direction, but that is not what I expect from Wolfenstein!   I'm just hoping when I go back and play it offline as I now intend to, I'll not choose the wrong experience...I'd love to give this 10/10 and have been counting down the days till release, but so far in the snippet I've played, I can see the co-op being rubbish unless with a friend preferably on LAN or voice comms.  6 seems fair.Luckily I got the game for free!"

213,jcarterchadwick,"Jul 29, 2019",10,Wolfenstein is a pretty good game with some flaws. Some of the boss fights are fun while others are bullet spongey and long. Jess and Soph have interesting dialogue that is not earthshatteringly good but just above passable. The guns are powerful and fun but most of the dual wielding gone except for use with pistols which is disappointing. The enemies are sometimes bullet spongey as well but not terrible. The story was interesting enough and makes me excited for a Wolfenstein 3. If you enjoyed the enigma codes in Wolf 2 this guy should be very good for you.
214,gareth001,"Aug  2, 2019",7,"Good game at half the price of the main Wolfenstein titles! I've played every Wolfenstein there has been and enjoyed them all. I'm about 2/3rds through Youngblood at time of writing this review and it's enjoyable. Yes it's NOT at the same level as the main franchise titles, but this is a spin off and is not supposed to be - hence being half the price! To me it's a fun game which is set in the Wolfenstein world - once you get used to some of the funky game dynamics. There are other games which have similar saving styles - but I think I've actually died 3 times since I've started playing and has never been a huge problem. Did anyone complain about GTA V with some very long missions with no checkpoints? I guess if you are dying that much, maybe use an easier setting? I think it's a nice dynamic the way you have 3 lives between you, but you can also recover one enough. If this was full price, I would be upset - as it is, value for money - it's overall a good game"
215,pailbuckets,"Jul 27, 2019",9,"Lifelong fan of series: I’ve played Wolf3D, Spear of Destiny, RTCW, Wolfenstein 2009, TNO, TOB and TNC. This is another strong entry in the Machinegames series with stunning environments, likeable characters, and challenging fights made more interesting by extremely detailed level design. Many reviewers have complained about the RPG elements; they are pretty much like the ones in Doom 2016 and no more cumbersome to manage. Also I’ve heard people dunking on the AI companion, and I’ve had no problems with it. The reviving mechanic took some getting used to but it is manageable. You can completely ignore the micro transaction system. Sorry to see that another good Wolfenstein game is facing typical gamer backlash (look at the wording of the negative reviews and it becomes clear it’s the usual reactionary trolls who would have hated TNO too if they’d been paying attention at all."
216,CheesePake,"Jul 30, 2019",10,"Столько отрицательных отзывов, что я просто шокирован. Ведь игра просто находка. Она шедевральна! И сейчас я подробно распишу почему эта игра просто 10/10. 1. Помните Бласковича? Этого невзрачного солдафона в первой части и нытика во второй? Так вот тут этого недоразумения нет. Тут у нас две девчушки-хохотушки, которые блюют после первого убийства нациста и потом, как ни в чем не бывало, начинают весело их всех разрывать на части. Вот это я понимаю! Сразу проникаешься к главным героям. Чувствуешь из развитие. Понимаешь их. 2. Помните те серые и скучные катсцены между миссиями в предыдущей части? Так вот выдохните! Их здесь нет! Все четко и лаконично: карта и пара слов о месте где вы будете играть. Просто и шедеврально. 3. Музыка. Помните как она постоянно мешала вам? Заставляла подстраиваться под нее и быстрее рубить нацистов. Расслабьтесь. Здесь этот изъян исправлен. Ее тут считай нет. 4. Предыдущие части явно были для казуальщиков. Кому интересно бегать по локации и весело мочить горы солдат? Вот тут настоящий хардкор. Будь у вас хоть плазмоган, но вы не собьете щит солдату-срочнику, призванному в армию Германии из деревни под Берлином. Сразу видна проработка мира, ведь технологии Германии в игре запредельны. Все как и должно быть! 5. Линейность для ленивых геймеров! Здесь же вам предоставлен полный доступ к локациям! Вы можете как спасти из лап захватчиков пару бомжей, что копались в урнах на улицах Парижа, и попали под сапог патруля, так и спереть сухпаек у офицера Ганса, который он спрятал в сейф в соседней локации. Ах да, код от этого сейфа будет лежать в другом конце города, так что развлечетесь и побегаете на славу! Такого разнообразия и проработки сайдквестов я не видел давно. Ведьмак и в подметки не годится! К тому же игра старательно окунает вас в эти шикарные задания. Ведь если вы пойдете по сюжету уровнем меньше, то вы ничего не сделаете своими пукалками срочникам в уберброне. Реализм! Таким образом, совершенно не понимаю всех претензий, что высказываются к игре. Развелось нынче токсичных геймеров из нижнего интернета. Игра просто 10/10 и для меня игра года однозначно!"

219,wtfisthat319,"Jul 26, 2019",10,The only complaint I have is the usual launch day game play bugs that are ubiquitous with modern Game releases nothing serious that is deal breaker however. The story does tie into the the previous Games very well. Thanks to the incessant inane classic 80's teenager dialog the playable characters feel like daughters or nieces rather than a sex symbol or eye candy which was a nice change of pace imo but can wear thin quickly depending on who you are. The Arkane touch to the open world aspect is obvious and actually a nice touch that makes for some more fun exploration that the previous entries did not have/need(?) I want to note that the developers under the Bethesda Game Studios producing The Elder Scrolls and Fallout properties need to look at what the other developer studios under the Bethesda brand umbrella are doing and producing and take cues and inspiration from them and possibly employ some of the tech they are using that is obviously in some ways better than what we have seen in Fallout or The Elder Scrolls thus far.  Not sure why this is getting zeros and 1's so I am giving a 10 out of 10 instead of an 9 or 8.5. Get this game and help make France Nazi free

223,zsavage999,"Jul 29, 2019",9,I'm new to the series but when I picked up and played this title I loved the gameplay.  The action is great
224,Darkmoon99,"Jul 27, 2019",10,"I got this game for precisely the reason so many Wolfenstein fans seem to hate it. It is finally something different with the Wolfenstein franchise. A friend and I who play it together absolutely love the game. It has a story, if not a bit cliched (find missing daddy), has a lot of fun humor elements and is well voice acted. It isn't an on the rails shooter like previous Wolfenstein games but is instead a completely different animal. It has a sort-of open world element, RPG-like mechanics like Diablo in that you have 3 skill trees with skills that you can buy with skill points you get for completing missions and leveling up. Different skills cost a different # of skill points to get. With them you can increase your max health, max armor, heal/repair health & armor when getting your friend back to their feet again, get a cloaking ability and upgrades for it and melee skills like ""crush"" to name some. If you play it long enough you'll be able to eventually max-out your character with all of the skills/upgrades. There are stealth kills and different melee kill types you can do like forcing/twisting a gun back towards an enemy before it being triggered. It was surprising the first time I got into a melee struggle with an enemy with his weapon and was able to get them to shoot themselves in the face. It is a bit different for each weapon type an enemy may be wielding. Despite people calling it a looter-shooter like Borderlands, it is NOT. Once you get a weapon, it is yours forever (except temporary ""big guns"" you loot off big enemies or find in breakable crates) and it is just a basic weapon of that type that you upgrade with ""silver coins"" you find as loot. The weapons are not randomized enchanted/variable weapons like Diablo and Borderlands. The only thing looter in this is the silver coins for weapon upgrades and collectibles. Don't let the hate scare you away from this gem. Especially if you are looking for a fun game where you can kill nazis in a lot of different ways and has a story with humor to it. I rarely leave reviews for games here but after seeing all of the hate, I felt I needed to give a different point of view, I had to show the developers and other potential players that not everybody hates this game and is angry at the developers for daring to do something different with a franchise. Some of us absolutely love and have fun with it. It is a great game on its own and a shame that it is getting so much hate from Wolfenstein fanboys who wanted yet another clone of the previous games and seem to hate anything evolving and being different about the game play. Personally I get bored with straight up shooters where you follow a fixed/limited path killing streams of enemies along the way. I really like the additional engagement and goals I have in this style of a game. This was so engaging and fun for us that we spent over six hours straight playing it because we lost track of time while immersed in the game. P.S. As for the micro-transaction hate, it is COSMETICS ONLY and can all be purchased with in-game silver coins as well. I can earn enough coins for an armor or weapon skin in about an hour or two if I am not a lazy whiner who wants everything given to me without effort."
225,Toastermate,"Jul 26, 2019",9,"A fun new take on the franchise. I really enjoy the combat, the gameplay, the open world aspect and the graphics. I also really like how you get more and more abilities throughout the game. The only thing I didn't like as much was the lack of a real story. All in all it's a fun Looter Shooter spin off but if you expect a Wolfenstein 3 you wont be happy."

228,WNxWind,"Jul 28, 2019",9,"Wolfenstein: The Division - This was a game I was very excited about to play co-op Wolfenstein with friends. I still enjoyed my initial 4 hour session quite a bit, it was quite fun to stream although the night prior when I learned that the fast visceral combat of Wolfenstein was going the route of a bullet sponge-ish route with leveled AI opponents and progression for you and your buddy (or random/AI) you are playing with. With that said, on my rig the game is rather gorgeous at all ultra settings - the combat is indeed satisfying although the kill animations are FAR less brutal and seem to be hit or miss in regards to which weapon is being used and how the bodies react to being hit.Having only done 3 side quests I cannot judge the total package. While The previous Machine Game reboots into the Wolfenstein franchise have received 90/100 and then a 91/100 from me - currently after both Accelerated Evolution's reviewers Angles and I played together I am going to give this a 80/100 at this current time. I have never been a big fan of soaking bullets into enemies, The Division / Destiny etc. have never been my cup of tea. I was expecting this to be more like Shadow Warrior 2 with a more focused story-line and... without the amazing amount of weapons that game produced as unique weapons. That game is basically Diablo / Torchlight / Path of Exile in first person (think HellGate London except with that Doom/Quake/Wolfish / Serious Sam style combat of Shadow Warrior) With that in mind I will recommend this title due to the low price and 30-40 hours of content in a singular play-through with a friend; the replay value seems to be rather high if you end up playing with other friends and have a good time together. for 30 dollars base or the 40 dollar edition I purchased which has the buddy pass (which I still have not used; although it is appreciated). Machine Games and Arkane Studios indeed did do a rather great job here, although not quite what we assumed it would be from the E3 footage.upping to 9/10 on Metacritic to offset the negativity."

The ray tracing and lighting make this literally the best looking game I've ever seen, and with Nvidia DLSS I can't express in words how well this game runs. I know a lot of fans of the Wolfenstein franchise were upset cause this wasn't a story based single player game, and I get that. The dialogue is kinda annoying, BUT the mechanics of the game still shine. They gunplay is superb, the 80's setting is cool, and it's just a hell of a lot of fun to play. I still want a proper single player sequel to Wolfenstein 2 (which Im sure we will get) but if you have Game Pass I urge you to give this game a try. It's a lot of fun."

237,P0tenC,"Dec 28, 2019",8,"Initially very hard to get the buddy pass set up properly, mostly because of lack of proper instructions. However once that was sorted the game was a lot of fun. I played coop with a friend and we had a very good time. Check the end of this review for a short guide on how to get it working. The graphics is very good although not obviously so during the intro and first mission. Rooms with desks have a lot of clutter and there are loads of different detailed objects scattered around. Guns feel meaty and make good sounds with good upgrade options available. The music is good with a distinct 80's vibe, although I would have liked a bit more of it. The sisters themselves are a bit annoying and unlikeable, thankfully you don't have to watch too many cutscenes with them. The gameplay is solid with a good variety of soldiers and mechanical opponents. The stealth mechanics could do with some work and melee kills could have a bit more variety. I don't think it would be as fun as a single player game, so definitely recommend playing with a friend. The difficulty is nicely balanced with some sections requiring a few tries to complete. Some parts of the sewers were completely pitch black, so definitely need the light attachment upgrade on your weapon! To get the buddy pass working you need the deluxe version of the game and your buddy needs the trial version. There is no play button for the trial version of the game on the Bethesda launcher, so either add it to steam as a non-steam game, or try launch it via the executable. Once the game is launched you need to link both accounts and then add a friend, these need to be done in-game. Only at this point can you invite your friend via the buddy pass. I don't understand why the buddy pass is so hard to use, when the rest of the game feels pretty polished."

239,Josue_online,"Oct 20, 2019",8,"The game shows that it is ""secondary"" within the saga and it is noticeable that it is something small compared to New Colossus as well as there is much less 'movie' (although it also has). Maybe he's not at the 'Old Blood' level (equivalent game in the saga). Not because it is a more ""small"" game has less details. Thus the game is full of details, documents, illustrations, music (cassettes). I think that due to the dimensions of the game, it is advisable to play it at a high level of difficulty (at least one level above what we would normally consider playing) so that the challenge compensates a bit the duration of the game. (duration that considering the sale price, cheap, because it is more than correct). As a technician, graphically on PC, as it always depends on the equipment you use, in my opinion this study works very well for PC, and hardly a ""first person shooter"" will work better on PC than the Wolfenstein (or Doom) so that the gameplay is guaranteed Very good in that regard."

242,christinacrouch,"Jul 29, 2019",5,"I am approaching this review as a newcomer to the Wolfenstein franchise. I think a more balanced review is needed to redress the balance of metacritic reviews. I'm not going to say that the game is in a good state at the moment, but I do think there are features to recommend, and some of the issues could be patched straighforwardly if the designers were willing to make the game much more playable. There are, also, unfortunately quite a few problems. Characters:I like having a game with two female protagonists - I find it refreshing in a mostly male dominated genre. Yes they're very goofy, and occasionally the dialogue is rather silly, but I think it adds levity to the game. This is not a game trying to take itself too seriously. If you want something serious, look elsewhere. Buddy codeWe liked the buddy code system - I bought the deluxe to share with a friend, and its nice that not everyone has to buy the game to play so you can bring a friend in and see if they enjoy the game first for just an extra £10. More games should do this! PerformanceThe release of the game was shambolic to put it politely. The PC version released a day before consoles, and you could pre-download it but it didn't work until about a day or so later, I guess when they'd patched it. The known issues at release was also pretty long. This said, when I finally got it running, the game runs smoothly on relatively modest computer performance (I am running a Ryzen 5 2600X and Vega 64). This said, my playing partner was still having glitches through the cut-scenes. WorldThe story opens as essentially a rescue mission for BJ Blasckowitz set in the 1980s. The sisters infiltrate the French resistance in the underground system of Paris. The initial mission on the blimp is supposed to act as the tutorial, and then the world is designed around an explorable overworld connecting to locations. Tutorial/Opening scenarioThe blimp 'tutorial' has rather uneven pacing. The early mission stuff was fairly trivial (like opening shared life crates), but there is a massive difficulty spike with the final boss compared with the rest of the mission. We completed the rest of it on normal, but had to lower to casual to do the boss, and had numerous attempts at it. We do like the 'save your partner' resuscitation and pep system. Unfortunately, the first frustration is that when you both die and game over, the ammo you have is the ammo you had when you died, not when you saved. This means that successive attempts in a limited ammo environment  result in dwindling ammo unless you basically do an ammo trolley dash, and then deliberately die, just to start on more ammo. This is such a stupid system that needs patching. Traversing ParisOnce you are done with the tutorial, you reach the resistance hub world, where you can take the metro to your missions in paris (with additional ones to collect from the people at the hub). The hub is decently designed. The game appears to give you choice as to where you can go next, but because of the levelling system, the choice is not as open as it appears because of the level of the enemies. Under level enemies are reasonable trivial. Over level ones will kick your butt. So you only want to do level matched missions. This also brings up the second issue with the game - the RPG mechanics. I can understand the idea of progressively adding mechanics during the tutorial, but locking powers out in the main game is annoying, and the levelling system removes free will. Also some of the powers are disappointing. Dual wield only lets you dual wield pistols (your basic pea-shooter). The second issue that comes out on the world map is saving. There is no saving on the hub world. You die on the way to a mission, its back to the start for you. How about some checkpoints??? Another issue is that there can be named 'wanted' enemies roaming the map that you cannot kill (because you are underlevelled) that you can potentially accidentally run into. And we did. UpgradingThe gun upgrading mechanics seem decent with a huge amount of customisability allowing you to get your guns how you want them to be. However, here comes the next problem:, is that the game doesn't pause when you enter the menu. Need a wee? You can't. Need to upgrade something? Get shot while you are doing it. The game needs a pause function. Summary:The thing that's disappointing is that the game could be good. The enemy types and environments are interesting, it has a newcomer approachable story and characters. The levelling system could potentially be removed to allow players more free roaming / choice, but retain progressive skill unlocking if they must, and gun upgrading. The game desperately needs more / better placed checkpoints, a proper pause function, and a save system based on either free saving where you want or at least reviving you with the load out you had before the save. 5/10"

249,Mavial,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"First of all. You can't change the games language, meaning I was stuck listening to German fighting Americans talk German to one another. Cool. Apart from that the game doesn't allow fullscreen, meaning I was stuck at 60hz, which let me tell you (because the developers have probably never player a shooter in their lifes) feels like **** in a run & gun shooter. I was surpised to find that there is a FOV slider, which I had honestly not expected in such a terrible game. The mouse sensitivity slider barely affects the actual sensitivity; I had to lower my DPI from 800 to 200 to achieve anything even close to what I usually play. To the gameplay: The movement is good. It's not DOOM but its fun.  On the other hand, the gunplay feels very unsatisfying. There is zero feedback on whether I've actually hit an enemy or not and the terrible ""recoil"" thats literally the gun just jumping around obstructing my vision doesn't help with seeing what I'm aiming at. The NPC spawns are horrible. I kept dying to random NPCs spawning 2m behind me after I had already cleared an area so there was no way of properly finding cover I one is to rush straight into the action instead of having to deal with the garbage feeling of a long range gunfight in this game. There's a lot more that annoyed me about Wolfenstein: Youngblood, for example the fact that the menus are the most counter-intuitive I've used in ages but I think you get the point. This ""game"" is nothing but a waste of storage and I highly discourage anyone from buying it."

Trash Shooter, with cringy jokes etc..., but this is all what they are all over the game, no character evolution, no emotional moments, which are important in such stories, just stupid and cringy jokes, also as I said, they are both the same, no matter which sister you will chose, nothing changes... I think they should make them in contrast, I like the idea of sisters and motivation, but they do not feel alive, they should made them more different one from another, to play with that contrast, like one is crazy daredevil, which can be very emotional and loves sister very much  and second like humble bookworm, who is versa, very cold, but can become crazy when things are going about killing Nazi machines (for example) and like their relationship evolve, that they may become enemies one for another, but when things go serious they always stand one for another, evolute that, make them more alive, also they should have different tools and skills too... But, unfortunately they are just an Option, they are running and shooting skins.- Combat is very limited, not many possibilities in Active skills, not many varieties of weapons, that will not be problem, if game will be just a shooter, like original game, but they tried to step into the RPG, Looter-shooter area, but fully ignore the main rules of that genres, RPG, especially ARRPG should give more options in fights, more active skills, more varieties using that skills and synergy between them, but you have just KIck and Knock, which you will not use often, also weapons, if you are going into the ARPG or Looter-shooter, then there should be a lot of variety of instruments, yes, game have some weapons you will open by the progress, but I mostly did not even need to use them, they are quite limited in ammo, quite situational and more often you will run just with the same tools and the same skills and get bored quite fast, after about 20 hours I find myselfs running invisible to avoid battles, but if you played Looters like Warframe, then the thing of such game is exactly to fight and get a lot of fun from this fights. It's not bad, you will have fun, but it's limited and get boring after time, especially when enemies also grow in LvL and fight becomes annoying sometimes more, than fun.In most other things game is not really a bad game, as a Thrash ARPG Looter game, it's not a bad one, not really a long game, but repetitiveness and small amount of tools and active skills make things boring at the end, but not enough to destroy and make me drop the game.Quite a nice game to have fun for some evenings, but not fully used the potential of what Thrash ARPG Shooters can be, especially 3A... Hope they will not drop sisters and make them more alive in next games and hope they will continue both versions of the Wolfenstein universe games, as Shooter, same ARPG ones and will fix mistakes they made in this game, to push the Thrash genre to it's limits. Graphics is good and optimization is amazing.Sounds are fine, but did not feel the music, it's there and is quite good, but it do not have this impact, when you feel adrenaline, which is important in such games."
255,Zipfer,"Jul  3, 2020",0,"No saves.You start the game each time from the start of the level.You can't pause.Characters are terrible - stupid story, stupid jokes, stupid behavior. - FACEPALM that's what I've got each time I listen this nightmare.Immediate refundLvl design is good but all negative aspects don't make you enjoy the game at all."
256,muzmuz,"Aug 10, 2021",4,"Despite having amazing controls and shooting mechanics that can rival even the best titles on the genre, Wolfenstein: Youngblood has a disappointing RPG gameplay structure that feels tedious and monotonous due to its rather cramped map design, high TTK, respawning enemies that you need to kill over and over again, quest structure and the pace-breaking need to grind side-quests instead of enjoying a straightforward storyline. Don't get me started on the microtransactions that doesn't belong anywhere in this title. An unwelcomed, poorly-executed, greedy take on the Wolfenstein franchise."
257,stevRaJah,"Jan  7, 2021",6,"Truly not horrible at all. Lost me at first when I realized it was a co-op shooter, but then won me back when I started unlocking all the absurdly silly weaponry/powers. Funny enough the AI teammate ended up being far more useful than the internet rando-s who would join my game, except during the final boss which requires a high level of coordination on normal difficulty (especially if you are as under leveled as I was). My AI teammate all but broke during this finale. Also not sure why ""daily"" and ""weekly"" challenges are present. Level system is superfluous as enemies never become push overs, so its almost like leveling up allows the game to become the action game these mechanics obviously pair well with. The skill trees are fine, but stealth is so ridiculously overpowered once enhanced it allows the player to skip a lot of the spongier enemies during the final crawl to the boss. Don't know if I would recommend that as you'll need to be level 45  if you are playing solo, and those things drop exp. Story is quite lame, and I'm not sure what was intended with the sisters but they seem weirdly unlikable on purpose as if another narrative was in place and their behavior was a vestige from an earlier incarnation of the plot. Now, it is an interesting idea to have the children of a famous war hero be two insufferable chatter boxes with very banal dreams (writing a novel), and an impetuous need to follow in the footsteps of daddy (with little provocation they steal a helicopter from the CIA). Kept waiting for the game to do something unexpected with this, but sadly that never comes to fruition and the game becomes a hagiography for a fictional Nazi killing family."
258,jessejojo,"Aug 29, 2019",5,"This game isnt as bad as people make it out to be. However this game is just average and an insult to the other Wolfenstein games. The few times this game is good, is when there are cutscenes with B.J. in it. The two main characters are a joke and really not likeable at all.The gunplay for me is not as good as in other titles, simply because you have to switch your weapons constantly to deal damage to different enemies. This takes the flow out of the combat. There are sidequests in the game and if you really want to play this game on normal or hard, they are mandatory simply because enemies will outscale you. Thats a problem because there is not a single interesting sidequest in the game. So do yourself a favor and turn the game on easy. In that case you dont have to suffer through sidequests. Did i mention that these quest will take you to the same maps over and over again with same spawns? This isnt fun at all and the quickest way to get around is to not kill anybody or just throw a hatchet at everything that moves because its a oneshot most of the time. Throwables completely brake the game and shouldnt even be in there. You will forget the story the moment you finish the game, due to some generic looking npcs with zero interesting things to say. Speaking of finishing the game: If you rush through this game on easy, you will probably see the credits after 4-6 hours which is a joke. In conlusion: This game does not deserve to be called Wolfenstein. They took out the interesting story and characters and added useless coop, which nobody wanted. The games tries to get more playtime out of you by adding rpg elements and sidequests, which are not interesting at all. The combat feels broken the moment you realize throwables are op and the whole weapon switching drags it out even more. I recommend you pick up the other Wolfenstein games if you havent played them and wait for a deep sale on this one."
259,D3D11,"Jan 28, 2020",6,"This game is absolutely not as bad as many players state here. But neither good. If you can get use to the infantile twins and the fact that this is a girl-exclusive group, you can have a decent FPS game with amazing optimization. Yes, it is repetitive, but the gameplay is actually not bad. The question is: aren't we tired of killing Nazis? The Nazis were playing children compared to the commies, and guess what? We have a commie character in the bunker with a hammer and sickle who gives us missions. WTF??? That is just outrageous and unforgivable."
260,SilverOrlov,"Feb 24, 2020",5,"1) I did not want to give the game a ""red rating"" because there are some interesting and good things in it too. But it doesn’t deserve a normal rating either, so I stopped at the minimum “yellow” - rating five.2) Five is suitable also because half of the game - good shooting, music and graphics, and half -  very poor and ugly ""enemy level system"", when a soldier 2 levels higher is able to take off the sisters in a super suit with super powerful guns(wtf?!). This comes to the top of absurdity with the last boss of the game, when you go on a mission with a certain level, and the boss at his last stage jumps to several levels up and you suddenly have to fight him ""without Vaseline"", and leave the fight to pump up some levels does not work, because of fu**ng auto-saves and checkpoints.3) Poor story during 3 missions: prologue, three towers with keys, the last laboratory. That's all.4) Stupid behavior of sisters... Compared to the incredible charisma and sparkling humor of the protagonist of the previous parts, his daughters are rude and dumb typical ""children of modern liberal trends"", stuffed with idiotic and flat jokes at the level of cheap American comedies like ""American pie""."
261,gameking,"Jan 10, 2020",5,The scenario is very very bad. Too weak. Game-play is same with the other wolfenstein games. Single player mode is not very good. On the other hand the graphics are good. If you want just kill enemys and use guns and just a action you can enjoy this game. But if you want strong scenario like other wolfenstein games you will hate it. This game is worst wolfenstein game ever.
262,adelintru,"Apr 13, 2020",0,"Not really a game worthy of the Wolfenstein Series. I have played every game since Wolfenstein 3D. The idea is nice, however, the implementation is bad. Storyline ist boring, weapon logic bad with having to think all the time what bullets to use. Enemies respon for no reason, the AI sibling is almost retarded and you get thrown into missions that require higher LV for no reason without any ability to go back. At this point, I just hope they don't f*** up Wolfenstein 3."
263,Trainspotting,"Sep  4, 2019",3,"I have played all the recent incarnations of Wolfenstein including the New Order, the New Blood and the New Colossus.  Those games rank from very good to excellent.  Youngblood is terrible it should not even be considered part of the series.  I will go over a few of the major problems. I played with the AI as my coop partner.  The coop partner is as dumb as a bag of hammers.  If you are fighting a boss it goes right up to it and just stands in there and shoots until you have to go rescue them.  You can't finish bosses because the AI keeps losing lives for you. The worse thing if you lose a boss battle it sets you back to when you enter one of the Brothers (boss area).  This makes you do over 15 to 25 minutes over again to get to the boss area. Bleep that. You constantly have to keep going over areas that you have been through to get to the next mission and fight in the exact same areas.  If you clear an area and step out it for even a second and step back it is fully stocked once again, what a waste of time. The map is worthless and garbage. The main complaint that everyone finds is that the earlier Wolfensteins had a very good story.  This one has a nonexistent storyline.  It is boring and does not try to absorb your at all. Everyone knows it Bethesda so can you say micro transactions. The final straw for me was during one of the boss battles I was to pick up 2 computer keys after killing the bosses.  I killed both bosses and got 1 key but where they said the other key was there was nothing.  I tried for 15 minutes trying to get to the location of the key and could not pick it up where it should have been on the screen.  That was it for me, I deleted the game. I compare this to the last AAA game I played Metro Exodus which I would give a 9 out of 10 and this one fails in every respect.  Bethesda hopefully the new Doom game coming out will be a whole lot better. However Fallout 76 and this dumpster fire does not make me think it will be much better."
264,Dom20,"Jan  7, 2021",4,"Sterbenslangweiliges Spinoff ohne Tiefe. Ausser dem Waffengefühl ist nicht viel da was die Vorgänger ausmacht auch weil die Gegner massenweise Kugeln schlucken und somit sich die Gefechte ziehen. Nicht Mal im Koop ist das cool oder unterhaltsam genug um über die Contentarmut hinwegzusehen weil man ständig über die selben Maps läuft. Die Story ist nur Beiwerk, dafür sind die Töchter Blazkowicz nicht interessant genug. Am Ende hoffe Ich das Bethesda aus diesem missglückten Experiment lernt."
265,Frank1982,"Sep  4, 2019",4,"I've played every Wolfenstein game since its inception from back in the day. Reading some of these ""negative"" reviews are kinda hilarious.. but I get it. First.. its not unplayable nor does it warrant a refund due to being so ""bad"".. is it the weakest in the series? Yes. The game has its issues. I absolutely loved Wolf 2 New colossus and its story and game play. Going from that to this.. was defiantly going to be a decline.. New col for me was a solid 10/10. I'm currently at Brother 3 in this game and have seen videos and spoilers of it online.. I will def finish this game, but it has a few things that I didn't like.. I'll name 4 as somebody whos played all these games. For me the negatives are the following: 1. Leveling up and leveling up enemies.. - I didn't get it.. some of the basic enemies took so much rounds of ammo to drop them.. I can see maybe the super soldiers or mech robots ect being tougher as you get tougher.. but basic enemies shouldn't require 20 shot gun hits to drop. There was one point where I was using the zerstorerr weapon to clear out groups of enemies.. 2. The AI for me played ok. I only encountered 1 issue with it but was fine.. but I prefer to play my games solo and hated the co-op option and the AI computer that plays with you. Was a pain to go into battle only to stop go save your sister while getting gunned down only to have her save you from saving her.. really sucked. 3. side missions were very redundant.. it got to a point where I would save up several side missions to just do them all when I was in the area.. There was one mission where they wanted me to find the secret brother 1 entrance through the sewers but I went the normal above ground path. But I had this stupid nagging unfinished notification that I didn't find the brother 1 secret entrance.. So even after I got to level 42 and beat brother 1 and 2.. I had to go back and hunt down the secret brother 1 entrance to get it off my list.. very dumb. 4. The story. or there lack of.. Outside of the beginning and ending.. there was no mid story. Juju just gets on the radio and tells you some non sense. There was no cut scenes after brother 1 and 2 and im assuming 3 will result in the same. New colossus was heavy on story which I liked.. this game just rolled from one action to the next.. no story.. Abby just sat at her computer, barely looked up to say anything to you.. I just felt they could have built the story up a little bit more.. Those were my complaints. Over all I liked the fast pace, It was still killing Nazis. I didn't care that it was teen girls. Who cares. They had to save BJ which was part of the story. I just hope when Wolf 3 comes out they go back to the new colossus blueprint. 4/10. Was def the weakest in the franchise.."
266,Shimmeywill,"Feb 19, 2020",2,Average fps with obnoxious characters and middling pacing and level design.
267,SlapmyFace,"Sep 29, 2019",7,"This is not a true Wolfenstein game, but it is a decent game, if you can look past is obvious flaws. Pros:+Weapon handling and feeling is excellent. The sound, the oomph and recoil of the weapons is on point+Weapon customization is cool. You can build for DPS, raw damage and accuracy, or a mix of the three+Tons of enemy types, flame thrower dudes, giant panzerhunds, you name it. And they are strong Contra:-Forced coop. It's built completely with coop in mind. And if you want to play solo, that means you have to get used to the AI. And it's gonna sometimes just not follow you, or its gonna keep fighting enemies instead of resing you, and it's gonna stand still in the middle of fight sometimes. It's good usually and when these things happen, its gonna suck-leveling. Leveling as it is is good, but sometimes you stumble upon a mission with higher level enemies, and few levels below the enemies means they will stomp you. Big Time-the frat boy attitude of soph can be cringy, bit I didn't mind. Additions:The pep system where you shout compliments to the other sister and they get buffs is very cool and unique. The Twins are mostly fine and didn't get on my nerves too much."
268,KeanuAnakin,"Nov  3, 2019",7,"Wolfenstein: Youngblood maybe the most mediocre Wolfenstein experience. After rebooting the series in 2014 with Wolfenstein: The New Order and the two other Wolfenstein games: The Old Blood in 2015 as well as The New Colossus in 2017, Youngblood is a let down. The gameplay is still fun, but the story is cringy and uninspirred. The graphics look good. Another bad addition is the microtransaction store. The main characters Jess and Soph are stereotypical teenage girls. The different districts you visit in Neo-Paris look nice, the problem is that they fell lifeless. All in all the game is just ok, but it's nothing like all the great predecessors. Pros:- fun gameplay- good looking graphics- nice Neo-Paris map Cons:- cringy and uninspired story- districts feel lifeless- microtransaction store Rating:- Gameplay: 9/10- Story: 4/10- Graphics: 8/10 Overall: 7/10"

285,MrPajamas,"Aug  1, 2021",4,"Wolfenstein: Youngblood is, for me, the worst AAA game I've ever played. I'm a fan of the Wolfenstein series and rank them among the best FPS efforts. I love Return to Castle and I also really like The New Order and Old Blood. I quite liked The New Colossus as well, but not this one really. I'd start with the main character or rather the characters, because the game is mostly made for co-op and that's where the fault comes in. Wolfenstein was never meant to be co-op in my opinion, but whatever. Because as soon as you play with a friend and not alone, the serious, scary atmosphere full of Nazism goes by the wayside and the game turns into a fun game where you and your friend are crushing Nazis head on. However, since the game is co-op, it lacks one thing, and that's story. The story here is, excuse me, awful, or you know what? No excuses. It's terrible. Mostly the scenes where your protagonists perform various dance creations in the elevator are really cringe. At least from my point of view. The game's also quite repetitive because it's switched to an RPG system. Yes, it really is. Why the hell not? Why are they throwing RPG elements into the Wolfenstein series? Very poor decision on my part and some of the levels here are just a nuisance. Once you get past all the repetitiveness, past all the cringe scenes in the elevator and get to the very end, that for me is also pretty meh and overall didn't exactly impress me twice, even though it was probably the best part of the game. Oh, and one more thing. On top of all the crap they threw in here, they also threw in microtransactions. How could they have gone that far... I'm trying to find at least something good about this game, but it's pretty futile. I can only praise the graphics, which are not beautiful, but not bad. Some of the weapons weren't bad either. Unfortunately, that's about it. I can't recommend this game in any way, and if you're a fan of the series, I especially can't recommend it, because you'll be sick of what happened to the series for a long time after finishing it."
