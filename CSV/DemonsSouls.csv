0,Elite_Reviews,"Nov 22, 2020",2,"Like so many others have already stated, this remake doesn't live up to original, not even close. They took great Japanese game and had no idea what to do with it. Conclusion : They made boring boss simulator. I had to buy it to try it, but i can say that after playing it i wouldn't even buy it for 30 dollars, just giving honest advice! Specially in rough year like 2020, when many don't have lots of money, it's wise to think what to buy and i wouldn't recommend this one. It gets boring quickly and add almost nothing to original. I would advise buying something that is actually fun and has lots of content like Assassin' Creed Valhalla or Cyberpunk 2077!"
1,SorrownoMore,"Nov 22, 2020",2,"Strong doubt that any real souls fan will like this, personally i feel empty after playing this.Nothing stood out, yeah some bosses were okay, but overall it's just meh. I would give it way higher score if it was like 30 dollars, but 70 is just too much for this. Overall i didn't like it.I don't regret buying PS5, because i have so many other games to play, but i regret buying this game."
2,dreamof-,"Nov 22, 2020",1,I didn't enjoy Demon's Souls Remake at all. Something felt off with it. Almost like there was no passion behind this project. Some boss re-designs looked worse than original and overall it didn't do enough new things to justify this remake. PS: I have played original multiple times.
3,Bloodborne233,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"Hopeless attempt to remake something that never needed a remake. Any other game would have been better choice, specially something older, pre 2007. I actually got really sad while playing it, because i was really hoping that it's something special, but it wasn't, it really wasn't. 60fps made everything smoother and that's about it. Not recommending."
4,imjusthonest,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"Where this deep, almost scary atmosphere from the first game? If you gonna remake a classic, you have to either make it better or at least same level. This on looks way too clean. I could mistake it for any indie game honestly. 70 dollars for 60fps. Welcome to 2020."
5,XfighterX,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"I'll be completely honest, i'm not impressed. As a longtime souls fan i was actually confused why even remake it? Original is perfectly fine, but i was like ""fine, i will try it"". Even tho it's 60fps, it doesn't feel ""extremely smooth"". It just doesn't add enough to justify this remake compared to other high quality remakes."
6,Ddraig,"Nov 21, 2020",0,Not worth £70...Only buy this game if you are a hardcore souls fan otherwise you will be hugely disappointed. There’s much better launch titles to get on the ps5 such as spiderman.
7,Powerless,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"Unusually bad remake from Sony. I was expecting something revolutionary for PS5 launch game, because this was supposed to be reason to buy PS5 in 2020, even tho i bought it anyway but for other games. But Demon's Souls remake was just waste of money imo, i haven't even finished it and i probably wont. I literally booted up my PS3 to try original again to make sure i wasn't wrong and no i wasn't. Original actually stood out in 2010. This one doesn't stand out even if really tries."
8,lastofreviews,"Nov 22, 2020",2,"Not what i expected! I was ready for some masterful remake, but what i got was average game. Hopefully Resident Evil 4 remake will be good!"
9,Xandl7,"Nov 16, 2020",0,overhyped game for ps5not worth the pricevery overpricedwait for a saleit doesn't worth it
10,SoundoftheSun,"Nov 22, 2020",3,"I'll make this review really short, because i don't have much to say about this one. Graphics - 8 / 10Story - 1 / 10Gameplay - 6 / 10New boss designs VS The Original - 4 / 10Innovations that would justify this remake - 2 / 10Conclusion: 3 / 10"
11,chuydavid,"Nov 23, 2020",0,"It doesn't worth what I spent on it. $80 Euros, no thanks! It's not that good."
12,justishar,"Nov 16, 2020",4,"I'm someone who played and loved DS3 and Bloodborne and was excited to give Demon's Souls a try, never having played it before. It turns out that this game is extremely faithful to the original game, which means that the mechanics of the game are quite dated. I've put about ten hours into it at this point and I don't think I'm going to go any further, because it's just so tedious. The game is pretty easy for the most part, including the regular enemies and bosses. This, unfortunately, leaves the challenging parts to be the things which aren't fun at all, including the maze like levels and distance between the save points and the end of the level.  If you make a mistake, or if the game throws in something like an invisible enemy that inflicts a new status effect that kills you in seconds towards the end of the level, then you get to retrace quite a long trail to get back where you were. Maybe ten years ago, this would have been less of a tough pill to swallow, but in today's day and age, and after having played (and mastered) DS3 and Bloodborne, this type of gameplay just feels tedious to be moreso than fun. I guess I'm back to waiting for Elden Ring."
13,Sundowner1,"Nov 20, 2020",4,"Caught up in the hype train I purchased this one, but I've never played a ""souls"" games before. After spending a few hours on this one I'd say its a hard pass. The difficulty isnt that bad, much like old generation games like Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania. You just need to learn how to play and what the patterns are. Honestly its not fun though, like at all. Generic character, no story, PVP is ridiculously frustrating while learning the game, and its just boring dying over and over on stupid stuff. Save your money for a sale if you must, but this is the most overrated game I've seen in a long time. It is a glorified tech demo, absolutely beautiful but not worth the time."
14,fight387,"Nov 13, 2020",1,Resident Evil 2 team actually tried when making remake of classic. This one just feels soulless cash crab. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
15,firefades,"Nov 13, 2020",3,"Overall very ""whatever"" remake. Ironically it feels like there's absolutely no SOUL in this game that's supposed to be part of SOULS SERIES. I would say wait for sale, but i would rather more recommend original."
16,lifeline_,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"Only strength over original is 60fps, that's it. Would never recommend this to anyone."
17,fly78,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"In my honest opinion it's not worth it. There's so many other games that actually need remake. This one is perfectly playable on ps3. PS5 starts out super weak, spiderman dlc and remake of not that old game? Come on. I have killed two bosses so far and it's just same. I have original as well and i rather play that."
18,enter77,"Nov 13, 2020",1,Weak remake with awful fake marketing. Disgusting. I would absolutely never recommend this game to anyone.
19,drksoulsforever,"Nov 13, 2020",1,"I'm so done with these endless remakes already, but the way they are marketing this is just awful. They took classic souls entry and painted it over, added hd textures, 60fps and now that's what console launch titles are going to be?? Not recommending this."
20,Nektarin,"Nov 22, 2020",0,This is not a demon soul.....Blm did their job.Not even close to the original.0/10
21,actualspiderman,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"Extremely weak entry into souls franchise. Other than graphics and fps boost, it has nothing special to offer."
22,geez99,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"I would recommend original so much more than this ""remake"". They took absolute classic and are trying to make quick cash with it. I still have original on ps3, you can get it cheap anywhere. This weak excuse for a remake shouldn't be a reason to get ps5. I'm very disappointed."
23,riddlemethis445,"Nov 13, 2020",0,This game is not worth it. It's buggy and it pales compared to superior original.
24,fightwithsword,"Nov 13, 2020",2,This must be most overhyped remake of all time. I bet people hype it up because it's console exclusive. I played it 2 hours and i'm already bored. 
25,SandraBenedrin,"Nov 14, 2020",0,There’s no reason for this remake to exist. The PS3 game runs better on PC as it is without the needless redesigns that ruin the atmosphere.
26,strongblood,"Nov 17, 2020",1,"The best thing of Demon's Souls were it's design and artstyle and Bluepoint has successfully ruined it, by editing characters, colors and architecture. On the other hand the bad thing about Demon's Souls were it's unbalanced gameplay and mechanics (you still need to grind items and can abuse some weapons in pvp) and Bluepoint didn't even touched it. Bad, very bad."
27,firsthere,"Nov 13, 2020",1,"Worst boss simulator of 2020. Can't believe people pay 60 dollars to die 100 times on one boss, just to move on to next boss and then next, over and over again. Sekiro at least tried to add some story. This is just meh."
28,Wickilini,"Nov 20, 2020",0,"It comes to a point that a challenge is turned into nosense, there is no fun in this loop."
29,AkiseKun12,"Nov 18, 2020",1,"Fun but with mechanics from a game from years ago, the graphics do not save it"
30,blyumazeiko,"Nov 19, 2020",0,"Если отбросить что она тормозит на ps5, неудобная работа камеры изза которой можно провалиться в яму и умереть так как узкие пространства с ужасным обзором, то что после каждой смерти надо начинать с самого начала, то игра довольно неплохая, но все вышеперечисленное в игре присутствует так что я жалею потраченных денег за это жалкое подобие игры"
31,Jhon71937,"Nov 22, 2020",1,É a mesma coisa no ps3 e ainda custa 300 reais mais 5 mil do ps5 não vale a pena
32,ando3000,"Nov 13, 2020",0,£70 is a total rip off. Greedy Sony trying to rob their early adopters. Rubbish. Don't waste your money.
33,Branvalis,"Nov 14, 2020",4,"Bluepoint reworked its core art, which was perfect as it was, leaving the part that really needed some next gen upgrades same as it was on PS3. As a result, you get nice graphics sacrificing the original eeriee and mystical soundtrack and atmosphere for a bunch of nice 4k screenshots with bombastic music but 11 years old gameplay. Play has no limits? More like marketing has no limits."
34,princessfurios,"Nov 15, 2020",3,"80€.Именно столько они просят за ремейк игры. 80, черт подери, евро.Давайте разберем по полочкам все, почему эта игра - ни стоит таких денег и уж тем более не стоит зваться наследником оригинала. Здесь, по классике нового ориентирования рынка Sony на запад, завезли BLM и SJW-мусор и прочие вещи, которым ним место ни в одной игре. Сеты персонажей выглядят прямиком как треш-фрики из Тамблера. Дизайн игры в целом и персонажей в частности был изменен на западный манер, потеряв былую оригинальность и самобытность. Персонажей сделали более ""репрезентативными"", как модно нынче говорить. И вы понимаете, о чем я сейчас. Про то, что герой априори небинарен и вместо пол здесь есть выбор между ""типом тела А"" и ""типом тела Б"", я думаю не стоит и заикаться.Обещания и реальность. Все мы не должны забывать громкие слова о трассировке лучей в игре на презентации PS5. А что в итоге? Это был обман, лишь ради громкого маркетингового словца. Про то что игра выйдет на PC и ""других платформах"" мы тоже помним прекрасно. Но ведь тогда не вышло бы просить за эту поделку 80€, верно, Sony? Конечно же, верно.Игра спокойно бы запустилась и на PS4, лишь с добавлением загрузок и в качестве ниже. Все мы видели The Last of Us Part II и то, что она прекрасно работала на прошлом поколении. И вы хотите сказать, что ремейк Demons Souls бы не пошел? Не смешите свою же аудиторию.Это глупость и жадность. Вопиющая. Ценник этой игре должен быть 40$, как у ремейка первой части Mafia. Не больше. А за 80€ и спрашивать с игры нужно, как с того, что стоит 80€. И это не цена данной ""поделки"". Ни в коем разе.Но, судя по оценкам, люди съели и это. И попросят еще. Тогда, впрочем, не жалуйтесь позже на то, какие сюрпризы вам приготовит Бобби Котик, поняв, как легко доить из такого стада как вы, ставящего 10/10 подобной ""игре"", деньги.Пожалуй, тут больше нечего сказать."
35,AceAscendus,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"Bluepoint completely destroyed the Soundtrack, Art Direction, Sound Design, Atmosphere and Environmental Story telling of Demon's Souls. Anyone who played the original Demon's Souls, but also likes this abomination is not a true fan of Hidetaka Miyazaki, From Software and the Soulsborne games. Only people who didn't experience the original Demon's Souls can like this garbage remake, because they don't understand what they are missing and what true Demon's Souls is."
36,snakemuho,"Nov 13, 2020",3,"To my knowledge, the appropriate term for something like this is ""Reforged"", not ""Remake""."
37,DigitalDevilSam,"Nov 14, 2020",1,"Completely ruins the aesthetic and the atmosphere and the soundtrack of the original game, which is the very thing that made the original a timeless classic. It reminds me of the WarCraft3 remake; a cheap cninese knock-off (no offence to the chinese)"
38,Buhan,"Nov 14, 2020",3,"Game play is decent however the artistic changes made this remake too difficult to truly enjoy, especially coming from someone who considered the original a favorite."
39,devilofumes,"Nov 13, 2020",4,"Disgraceful remake. FromSoft's art direction is lost here thanks to western developers thinking they know better. The environments, the lighting, the NPCs, the bosses and enemies, the voice acting, the sound design, and the soundtrack all have very drastic and awful changes to them. Don't get this if you're a fan of the Souls games."
40,tec,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"Game is more barebones than any other Souls game but suddenly after america retextures it, giving it only a visual upgrade, it is fantastic? no this game is a scam, demons souls was 9 years old with a 2 gen difference. it´s a glorified texture pack for 70 bucks + online tip, nothing new is added, no QoL changes. the visuals were just fine and releasing this as a consoleseller/ main lineup title is simply embarrasing. it was a dark gothic setting with little fantasy elements. now it´s bright and shiny. it´s wow reforged all over again, unfortunatly it´s released as a ""exclusive"" on a new hardware so people need to justify throwing their cash away for a new machine which tries even more to seperate you from your belonings and making you dependable from sony. big nope."
41,unotavailable,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"This is the laziest remake I've ever seen. There's been almost no changes at all. The only thing I noticed is the ability to send things to stash. Otherwise they just took the old game, put almost no work in it, slapped a $70 price tag and called it a day."
42,Hij45g,"Nov 13, 2020",0,This game lost its true style. A video game which was an good old game has lost its charm. It's difficulty system has been tarnished. I am really dissapointed
43,neoneekeri,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"This is an absolute travesty, I see no reason to give it anything above a zero when its quite literally the exact same game I already own but with an ""americanized"" artstyle. Bluepoint ""remade"" a great artists masterpiece by turning it into a disney animatronic ride where you need to be at least 110cm tall to enter. Its an absolute abomination and I cant decide whether to cry or laugh while comparing it to the original. A great testament to just how little SONY cares about games and how they only see them as products to milk for the lowest common denominator."
44,sleshdot,"Nov 16, 2020",1,"While the graphics is indeed awesome, the most iconic aspect of this game was its soundtrack. They ""remastered"" wrongly, removing all the iconic bits that made it so special, and now it sounds extremely generic fantasy music. The soundtrack of the Tower Knight boss fight? Gone. That's really a shame."
45,Emadddd,"Nov 13, 2020",0,One of worst remastered that I ever experiencedBravely I can say even god fall is much better than this ****
46,gamesssix,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"trash, too bad, you will only like if you are a franchise fan, if you're not, don't buy it!"
47,Lintzzz,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"Ridiculous long ways to go at the boss. Bosses are gods. Dark Souls 1,2,3, are infinite better, and now this refurbished...."
48,CollectRunes,"Nov 30, 2020",1,"Had solid potential, but sadly fell flat on pretty much every aspect. Other than 6ofps (that's like normal for every next gen game by the way, so it shouldn't be selling point anyway) it offer nothing really interesting. They don't do some crazy re-invention that would justify this remake like Final Fantasy VII Remake or Resident Evil 2 Remake. There's a reason why ""Psycho"" (1998) remake is so hated, but ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) remake isn't. Literally same thing matters for games as it does for movies."
49,Nostradamous,"Nov 28, 2020",3,"Really low quality,Absolutely Hollow content.Unbelievable priceAnd DissappointingComparabale at mobile games class!"
50,fairpricing,"Nov 30, 2020",0,Videogame publishers don't deserve 70 dollars just because they decided they want it.
51,and94,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"Well, most people prefer Lil Pump over Beethoven, so that explains the 10/10 reviews. Ruined the OST."
52,RoadtoHeaven,"Nov 30, 2020",2,"I'm pretty sure many people actually bought it, because there's not much else to play on PS5 right now (that's sad btw), but i strongly doubt that anyone deeply loves this game. What i'm seeing right now is that everyone is addicted to Assassin's Creed Valhalla and that's not PS5 exclusive. But for some reason everyone is using PS5 to play that, so maybe sony messed up with launch exclusives? I don't like Demon's Souls remake either, it feels boring and uninspired."
53,epicgamer444,"Nov 30, 2020",1,"@ GamingNordMediaNot just ""sources"". That's exactly what happened and i'm sure most people who have brain, already know this. This game got over 500 positive user reviews in first 2 hours. If you click on their profile it's very clear it's fake and some of them forget to translate it to english, so they posted review in their own language. So i did some research and basically it's bunch of asians from different asian countries who possibly get some money for writing positive reviews. So then some negative reviews came out that started calling it out and all of these were deleted. And now they have over 1400 positive reviews lmao. It's crazy."
54,Theboss2317,"Nov 14, 2020",1,"No tiene Ray tracing, no tiene 4k nativos, anda perfectamente los 60 fps y gráficamente no se ve tan como lo esperábamos, es lamentable que se utilizará para abrir una nueva generación, al contrario de la competencia que no tenía nada pero no la kgaron como lo hicimos aquí."
55,GamingNordMedia,"Nov 28, 2020",0,"The game is unplayable and the fact the developers refuse to put an easy mode in the game just makes the audience who actually can finish the game very small. There are sources that have come out and said FromSoftware/Sony paid the media to put a better score on this remaster. DONT TRUST WHAT YOU HEAR! If you like very very very difficult games then this is up your alley if not stay far away and don’t let positive reviews change you mind. This game caters to one audiences, people who love dying 60 times in one area"
56,jpw1978,"Nov 13, 2020",10,One of the best remakes of all time..You wont be dissapointed on this masterpiece..
57,RidiculousDeath,"Nov 15, 2020",0,Never thought I'd see a woke *souls game. This remake is SOULLESS. Sorry for the pun.
58,Torrant,"Nov 24, 2020",0,Probably the worst game i've ever played. Just can't bear it anymore. Demon's souls is now demon's Ruins.
59,doproyee,"Nov 13, 2020",10,blue point showed us how a remake game supposed to be. beautifully developed graphics and nicely made animations are pleasure to original fans.
60,Nezku,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Great game in every way!  Best remake ever, best start to a new generation, this is how creativity is made"
61,Lolasoxd,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"The game of the best souls of my life! I can highly recommend it to everyone! Huge game! Great for character creation, graphics, visuals, mood. The controller makes the whole game even more amazing! There can be no complaints about either Ps5 or the game! Whoever scores this didn’t even play with it, just intentionally pulling down the game. Unfortunately, there are a lot of trolls. It is better not to deal with them. Maximum point for me."
62,Farhad_jz8,"Nov 13, 2020",10,Great remake.goodjob Bluepoint.its a great game to start next gen with......
63,san1739,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Such a stunning remake!! Bluepoint games did a great work. The atmosphere is lit, the graphisms are incredible, the game can be at 60fps and the news soundtracks are beautiful.A must play for Soulsborne veterans and for newcomers of course"

68,VieRus8u,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"What is there to say, its a souls game. They took the game that started it all and built it from the ground out and gave it a rocket engine to boot.I love this when it came out on the ps3 and love it even more on the PS5. This game has everything you loved about the older game plus more, the only thing I was disappointed about was the 6th Archstone. Maybe they will get the go ahead to make a DLC where they fix and finally give everyone what they wanted for so long...a whole Archstone and new lands to explore."
69,Xavion,"Nov 13, 2020",9,"I am not sure what else to say other than this game is absolutely beautiful and smooth to play. As a massive souls fan I cannot recommend this game enough, the environments and atmosphere are amazing. The combat feels good and build diversity is high My only knock on the game is item weight, I really feel this one thing is just a bad design, I did not play the original but I saw others voice their displeasure over keeping it as well If you are a fan of the soulsborne series then I highly recommend you give this game a playthrough, with the active online community its going to be a blast"
70,Alixa2s,"Nov 13, 2020",10,Bluepoint has done it again. Another great remake. Great gameplay with smooth frame rates and one of the great visual graphics in video game history. Games like this are the why PlayStation has always been better than Xbox.

80,djape,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"As a souls game lover, it doesn’t get much prettier and performance wise better than Demons Souls PS5. This is truly a next next experience. Game is 10/10. Thank you BluePoint for remaking a masterpiece."
81,Asorr,"Nov 13, 2020",10,This game ist pure Nostalgic. Good graphics same feeling. I highly recommend this game
82,damkos,"Nov 13, 2020",10,If you like the souls series but never had a chance to try out demon's souls now it's the perfect time. Insane graphic overhaul and solid 60fps throughout.
83,Trevor18,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"A great game, everything is in the best possible shape and it deserves a perfect score."
84,Valdirr,"Nov 13, 2020",10,Jogaço pra quem é fã da franquia Souls é um prato cheio.
85,Yourboynik,"Dec  7, 2020",10,"Demon's Souls is now my favourite souls game. I believe the atmosphere, music and combat work amazingly together. Bluepoint have done an incredible job remaking this gem, it's one of the most visually stunning games I have ever played. Can't wait to see more from them in this next generation of games."
86,steveo481,"Dec  8, 2020",10,"Tough as nails, but a blast to play. It’s even better looking than I expected. The gameplay is very fluid and there were never any deaths that I didn’t step back and say, “well, that’s on me. I did (insert rushed tactic).”  Great game!"
87,Farhan_am,"Dec  7, 2020",10,Has a wondeful graphics and a wondrful story.It is prefect. I realy love this game
88,Pandur,"Oct  1, 2021",10,"With all the zero-score-review-bombers gone quiet, the extraordinary quality of both the original and the remake really translates into the excellent scores this gem deserves. It's a remake of souls and with soul. Everything is done with the right feel and so much love for detail. While all that was good and griping in the first place is left intact, visuals, atmosphere and controls were raised to a whole new level. A fully justified 10 it is."
89,Asyamura,"Dec 18, 2020",10,"all the 0's and 1's are there to tank the review scrore of this beautiful game. Digital Foundry has covered all the technical aspects. The game play is so good, Played the first version on PS3 when it came out, this was a great kick of nostalgia to the START of all Souls game. They added multi directional roll which wasnt there before and also the sounds of spells are so good. on my 4K HDR tv this is a JOY. I am proud to say this was my first platinum on PS5."
90,potatofruit,"Dec  5, 2020",10,"Brilliant, much better than all off souls-like, that i played earlier. Challenging. Graphics are wowwowwow"
91,Dudraug,"Dec  2, 2020",9,I haven't played in OG. But I've played in all other souls-borne-sekiro games. I'm happy that I can play in this game with modern graphic and original From Software gameplay. I know that there are people who say that atmosphera of og has been changed and game is not dark anymore. I disagree I can't say nothing about og but remake has dark dark dark atmosphera. I definitly like this game.
92,vzermiani,"Dec 10, 2020",10,"Demons souls foi meu primeiro game lá no PS3. Esse remake trouxe toda a nostalgia daquela época, mas em uma roupagem insana de bonita. Os gráficos estão absurdos e foi uma ótima forma de estreiar o ps5."
93,ziko_xman,"Dec 11, 2020",10,"my first and favorite souls game, this game was and still a masterpiece the remake make everything better ."
94,wangweixun,"Dec  7, 2020",9,This is the first soul's game that I didn't give up. It is hard but it is fair at the same time. You just need to know the tricks.
95,Bunkerbudy,"Dec 11, 2020",9,"I'm not going to spend a lot of words on this one. It's just an amazing game/remaster.Timeless base PS3 game + stunning work from Bluepoint again, making this game superb!"
96,Danniel929,"Dec 10, 2020",9,Bacana o game para um fã está D+Espero que faz a mesma coisa com o Bloodborne
97,LukasBoii,"Jan 25, 2021",10,"My first ever Souls Game, and it is amazing. Beautiful graphics, good gameplay."
98,skelly286,"Dec  7, 2020",9,The remake doesn't necessarily change any mechanical gameplay features but it is a friendly reminder and a very significant love letter of how far From Software has come.
99,J2ise,"Dec  9, 2020",9,So this Remake is just that a remake of the original with a few differences. This game has been fun to play. Its more clear to see in the dark then the original. I have made 3 builds and all are still fun.so the reasons it wont get a 10 is because its not done. seems like it being a ps5 game it dose lack some Umff im hoping there will be dlc and we finally get that world. Its a beautiful game and great job Bluepoint.
100,somegoodstuff,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Easily worst souls game of all time. It's just so empty and boring, as remake it should innovate, but it didn't at all."
101,ccmillertx,"Dec 20, 2020",9,"I am really enjoying this game despite how bad I suck at it. I never explored the Souls series before Demon Souls on PS5 but the sheer lack of titles this early on for ps5 led me to give it a try. Its hard! Really hard for me. I rarely stray from sports titles and the odd shooter so the whole concept was slightly new to me going in. I bought it the first weekend PS5 was out and I have yet to beat The Lords Path or even get into the online parts of the game ( someone showed up and killed me. I dont even know why they bothered) . Despite my slow progress Im loving every minute of it. I love cruising through Gates of Boletaria knowing whats around every corner. I havent even begun to explore the other worlds/archstones. Like I said, I suck at this game but sucking has never been so much fun. Main reason I didnt give it a 10 was the lack of a way to delete old character and to a lesser extent the camera gets a little unstable at times."
102,DiS82,"Apr  6, 2021",10,Whats wrong with all those 0 reviews? Lol? Game is masterpiece and Forms best Soulsgame to date. Maybe Bloodborne is only one that can rival it. And this remake looks and plays absolutely beautiful.
103,Dinosaur83,"Dec 22, 2020",10,"Greatest launch title of all time in my opinion! I’m a massive souls fan and was always getting a PS5 so this was an absolute no brainer, plays amazingly, graphics are immense, and just a wonderful experience from start to finish. I finished the game and collected all trophies without any guides etc, and took me 85 hours, and even up until the end of my 3rd playthrough, i did not want it to end, its all i have been playing for the last month, and now its over theres a giant hole that needs filling!!!"
104,Mmartinez,"Feb 23, 2021",10,"This is one of the most beautiful and well done remake I've ever played, it is completely original and respects so much the original game, we could say this game is the father of souls game, go wherever site you want to go this game is amazing and everyone is loving it, ignore the critics of the salty xbox guys at this site."
105,HellsaintED,"Jan 20, 2021",10,"It was my first ever contact with Demon's Souls, despite having played all Dark souls and Bloodborne, and this game is now probably one of my favourite from the souls series. Stunning visuals and sound design, smooth gameplay and overall a really fun and addictive experience that I spent 70+ hours immersed in so far."
106,Valvados,"Dec 11, 2020",10,"Bluepoint dit it again, they managed the unmanageable and created a masterclass remake. I'm a die hard Demon's Souls fan and I love this game. Thank you!"
107,Vlad101,"Dec 23, 2020",10,"На данный момент (декабрь 2020) - это единственная, нестоящая игра нового поколения.И Блюпоинст с Джапон студиус сделали очередной ремейк, невероятного уровня качества."
108,jrow,"Jan 25, 2021",10,"Can’t help, I’m addicted to this game. Don’t listen to the haters, games like these are not created for them. It is a beautifully designed remake and has everything a souls fan can dream of. Performance on PS5 is also absolutely great, almost no loading times, great visual effects, smooth 60 FPS. Probably never enjoy a souls game more."
109,ARTORIASSIF,"Dec  4, 2020",10,"This game is probably one of the best this year, and perhaps even the best in the series, because the developers have made great gameplay, good graphics, and great battles."
110,SaintTeemo,"Dec 20, 2020",10,"What an experience, from the very first cutscene, to your first boss encounter(ouch) to being thrown into the world of demon’s souls ready to explore, conquer, unlock hidden doors and discover the secrets that lies within, being a lunch title makes it even more impressive, the game looks absolutely breathtaking, plays and feels so good, the score is incredible and very captivating, as a new comer to the souls genre, I’m so hooked on it I’m now exploring the other souls game, this is a great game, at least in my experience, and I really do recommended it just for its next gen feel, a quality product overall"
111,bandito925,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"The people who rated this game poorly are hilarious. 50% of them are allegedly upset because they this game is nothing new. Bluepoint essentially remade the same exact game so it isn't worth the money. The other 50% of them are allegedly upset because Bluepoint changed too many things. They feel like Bluepoint should have just rereleased the same exact game with a better resolution.So of these people are also saying that they are upset that Bluepoint made the game 60fps. According to them, this game was designed as a 30fps game, so Bluepoint made the game worse by making it 60fps (keep in mind, anyone that actually bought and played this game would know that there is literally an option in the menu to run the game in 30fps.Strange how they wouldn't know this when they allegedly own and played this game? The best was from ""SoundOfTheSun"". This user thinks this game's graphics are average or a little above average, which is hilarious considering that literally everyone who actually played this game would immediately notice that this game has easily the best graphics out of any console game.It could be argued that the graphics are better than any PC game as well. So this was a very strange opinion. I have a sneaking suspicion that most of the people writing bad reviews are people that are, in reality, simply upset that they will never be able to actually play this game. This game was originally accidently announced as a multi-platform game, meaning it would come out on Xbox and PC. However, when Sony cleared up this error and confirmed it was a PS5 exclusive, a large number of Xbox & PC owners were strangely upset. This is literally one of the best games out right now and you would be doing yourself a disservice by skipping out on this game"
112,DSouls_guy,"Feb 26, 2021",10,"Demons souls on ps3 was already a piece of art, and the remake on ps5 has improved everything from the original!!! Best remake I've ever had the honor to play. Ds is an 11 out of 10!!!"
113,DaddyOtis,"Dec 22, 2020",9,"When I first started playing I was unaware of the “souls franchise” way of doing things. After finally understanding the mechanic of leveling up, getting to that next short cut and being able to finally beat an intimidating boss.... I love it! From soft made a fantastic game, and Bluepoint delivered on the next gen remake!"
114,Edgard86,"Dec 16, 2020",9,"Remake maravilhoso, extremamente fiel ao original porém mais bonito e sem bug. Achei que o game ficou mais fácil em alguns chefes, mas não tenho certeza. Defeito: Modo resolução do game não entrega nem 30 fps, impossivel jogar.. Não houve um tratamento de suavização nos frames, parece que fica em 20 fps... Nao da nem pra cogitar em não jogar no modo performance. PSN: Edgard_1986"
115,Rekof,"Apr 14, 2021",10,"It is basically reinvisioning of one of the best games ever made. Basically improved Des in every way,.. State of the art graphics with added animations for more weapons (back stabs, parries) Some levels maybe more moody in original, but I personally like all the design choices."
116,DOLLAR_376,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"Incredible remake that sets a new standard for soulslike games. Not only it retains the essence of the original, but it improves key aspects and puts it into a whole new level. - Story: same as the original, great and more explicit than in other souls, with more explanatory cinematics.- Gameplay: same as the original, but with more precise controls and lots of new animations, as well as nice controller effects (precise vibration and adaptative triggers).- Graphics: Absolutely incredible. One of the best looking games ever made. Physics have also been redone and are now more realistic. Lightning is way better than the original, giving each area its different tone and proper global illumination (no RTX, mind you).- Sound: The best sound in a game I've ever heard. Play this with headsets, as it sounds like movies do in theaters. From Software better adopts some of the changes Bluepoint has made in this remake into their next game, as some of the elements introduced here are truly gamechanging."
117,Lupitayoh,"Dec 17, 2020",10,"Terminado y ya estoy buscando el platino:Gráficamente es una maravilla, los efectos de luz son sorprendentes desde las primeras imágenes, y las texturas del entorno es de lo mejor que he visto desde TLOU2, técnicamente esta bien hechoEn todo lo que llevo jugado solo ví una ocasión donde tuve caídas de frames, pero en general el juego va de lujo a 60 estables, obviamente lo jugué en modo rendimientoAlgo que he leído mucho es que le tienen miedo por la fama que tiene un souls, si es la primera vez que tocas este tipo de juegos, sí se te hará difícil, si es así te recomiendo la clase mago o mas fácil: Aristócrata. La magia te hace un guerrero muy poderosoPero en sí el juego es bastante equilibrado, solo es cuestión de prueba y error, de que analices debilidades, farmees un poco, aprendas movimientos del enemigo, y te encontrarás con un gameplay adictivo y totalmente divertidoDestaco sobre todo el sonido, usando audífonos es una experiencia totalmente inmersiva, puedes escuchar si se acerca un dragón y desde donde viene, si hubiera estado nominado a en los TGA en esa categoría ganaba sin dudarAcerca del dualsense, no lo utiliza al 100% como Astro's bot, pero debo señalar que igualmente sientes la diferencia de estarlo jugando con este control, por ejemplo, puedes sentir cuando un enemigo enciende su bomba para lanzarlaComo punto negativo, le pondría la IA, entiendo que es un remake y que asi estaba programado originalmente, pero siento que es algo en lo que pudieron meterle mano, porque si se siente anticuada, malitaEn general es un remake totalmente pulido, con animaciones muy bien hechas, muy buen doblaje tanto inglés como latino (por ahí anda Vegetta), una dificultad equilibrada y totalmente adictivo, le doy un 100!"

120,jimmate,"Dec  2, 2020",10,"this game is so good. if you played the original demon souls back in 2009, this is what the game was like in our imaginations. this is the definitive next gen experience for any fan of challenging games. pretty much everything is in exactly the same spot as the original demon souls but is just reworked so fantastically, honestly i don't know what they could've done better. it's an easy 10/10.  people who are giving it a 1 and 2 rating are either salty they didn't get a PS5, or can't get past phalanx."
121,GoldMiner32,"Dec  2, 2020",10,"The first true next gen game. If you played the original game then don't expect much in terms of story, it is identical to the first game. However, the graphics, gameplay, sound design, music are phenomenal. This is the only true next gen game available. Highly recommended for fans of the original for those who have not played the original on PS3! Some are trying to review bomb this game and I bet none of those who gave the game zero actually own a ps5"
122,Katalas,"Dec  2, 2020",10,"This was an incredible game to play through, the atmosphere is so good and it looks absolutely amazing. The bosses were not that hard, I only had problems with two bosses, I died a lot trying to get them though. I have played Dark Souls 3, Sekiro and Bloodborne before this, not the original DS."
123,Thaksin,"Dec 13, 2020",10,"Я играю, мне нравится.Не играл в пред. версию для PS3, кроме как других игр soul`s like и если проводить эту параллель , все в духе и на высшем уровне с точки зрения картинки."

128,ConanTnT,"Dec 20, 2020",10,One of the best experiences you will have playing a souls game. It just isn't better as it is exclusive to the PS5. I am waiting for a version for the PC.

133,The_Juk3z,"Dec 16, 2020",9,"I have not played the original. I easy passed Bloodbourne and Sekiro, but this game is total unfriendly to player.Bbosses are easier to kill, but path to them is much more difficult than in ds3/bloodborne/sekiro. aslo visual is amazing."
134,Evelyn_Schwab,"Dec  3, 2020",10,"Absolutely stellar remake. Keeps the core atmosphere and gameplay of the original with some great quality of life changes, and, I believe, is the most visually and graphically stunning game yet released.As a game that came out on a more recent console, the original demon's souls is more in line with the gameplay styles expected by modern players and is less comparable to other contemporary remakes such as Resident Evil 2 and Final Fantasy 7. The gameplay of those game's original counterparts are bogged down by conventions that are rarely seen in recent titles (tank controls and slow paced turn-based combat respectively). The original Demon's Souls does not consist of gameplay that has been primarily thrown out over the years, instead being the beginning of an entire sub-genre innovated from the conventions it started.Demon's Souls is similar to Shadow of the Colossus in this way. The gameplay has not grown so dated that it needed to be fully overhauled, and the vast majority of core fans did not want drastic changes to the gameplay (as seen in the souls Sub-Reddits and other social media). However, if Sony and Bluepoint wanted to attract more new fans, the gameplay could have been innovated on.In the end, it's lose-lose situation. Either they isolate classic fans, or disappoint new players. If the decision they went with was the right one, no one can say, but, as a fan of the original, I am glad they went the way they did.Visually, the game is stunning. The PlayStation 5's boost in processing power over previous gen really shows in the amount of objects and tessellation seen in every scene, with displaced materials adding a sense of depth to even the flattest objects. The lighting and atmosphere is sublime, and stays true to the original in most cases and even improves it in some. Performance mode is as impressive as was stated in promotion, but as a primarily PC player, it was at times frustrating to have to choose between 4k and higher sub-division or 60 frames (Por qué no las dos?) but, with the state of console gaming, it's a compromise we have to live with.On the note of the main ""controversies"", exclusivity and price: Console manufactures need to sell exclusives to move units. That's the reality of it, and the practice of exclusivity (and the funding for devs that comes with it) has needed us some of the greatest games on every platform. The idea that exclusive are ""consumer unfriendly"" is a small-minded take and fails to look at the bigger picture. it would be nice if any game could be made for any platform without financial backers needing intensives, but that isn't reality. Now, on the price increase: I live in Australia where our prices on electronic goods, both physical and digital, are taxed and hiked significantly. Previously, AAA games cost around $100 AUD ($75 USD at the time of writing) - now they cost up to $120 AUD ($90 USD). I think this price jump is going to be a somewhat standard thing as we go into the future, and I for one.. am OK with it - in cases like this. Single player experiences need a way to compete with microtransaction-ridden multiplayer juggernauts, and if a price hike is the way to do it, then that sits fine with me (same goes for the digital deluxe edition). Problem is, we're already seeing that price hike carry over to games such as NBA 2K21 (A game with intrusive ads and literal slot machines), and I find that very distasteful. I don't play games like this so the price jump doesn't effect me directly, but if single-player games continue to earn dramatically less than multiplayer, it makes me worried for the future of this industry -  especially as a student developer."
135,Malim100,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"El juego es una obra de arte, artísticamente es sublime, técnicamente es un titán sólido y la diversión es de 10, el padre de los Souls. Repugnante ver tantos comentarios de haters, envenenados porque no pueden jugarlo."

139,princey2001,"Mar 25, 2021",10,Ive never played the original Demons souls but after playing the remake it has opened a new genre to me. From the absolutely beautiful Visuals Currently the best Next Gen game. It wasnt as hard as people said it would be but it was a fair challenge. Cant wait to Play Dark souls 1 Next.  SCORE 93/100
140,Jms91,"Dec 14, 2020",10,"Let me start by saying that I am no “SoulsBorne” expert. I pretty much didn’t start playing these types of games until this year, but in my time playing this game (and some bloodborne) I have become addicted to the genre. This game is one of the most exciting experiences I have had while gaming. I absolutely love the way I always feel on the edge of my seat while exploring. Whether your new to the sub genre like me or a vet at these games, everyone should give this game a shot."
141,CoDemos,"Dec  4, 2020",10,"Demon's Souls on PS5 is a spectacle to see and play.  It feels all too familiar to those of us who trudged through the PS3 version of the game but at the same time feels new and fresh thanks to the beautiful updated graphics, new animations (NPCs and enemies alike now have facial animations and so on...)the lighting and atmosphere are better than ever and to my to my first gripe be it miniscule..I miss the original soundtrack at times but the new ST works and sounds more like a newer Souls game than the PS3 OST did.  The game also feels much less clunky than the original and the new PS5 controller may be part of the reason why.  Another small grip is some of the art direction has changed but it honestly doesn't bug me like some others.  As a whole it feels great to be playing through Demon's Souls once again and Blue Point nailed the remake of it with gusto."
142,ChemicalRose,"Dec  7, 2020",10,Bluepoint needed to prove themselves handling this classic game that started a phenomena and created a genre. They were successful.
143,AndrewUsher,"Dec 11, 2020",9,True the original with a few modifications. Looks stunning and plays exceptionally well.
144,Jaquez_,"Dec 16, 2020",10,"Been a huge fan of the soulsborne games, including Sekiro and Nioh. Nevertheless, I haven't ever had the chance to dive into Demon's Souls. It's amazing. It's perfect. I don't know how the original was but right now, Demon's Souls is my favorite game by FromSoftware."

148,Stjepan3203,"Dec 12, 2020",10,"This game is absolutely AMAZING. Great soundtracks, visuals are netx gen same for Cyberpunk 2077 on my high end PC. This is basically the one remake I always wanted! Is a Souls game so keep in mind if you want jump in those games never show mercy. If you make a mistake you DIE. The point of those games is to learn learn and get better. You need learn from your mistakes that's the whole point of those games. So if you like a good challenge and you want jump in I can totally recommend this game. For me this is a clear 10/10."
149,RowdyDarwin,"Dec 13, 2020",10,My first Soul’s game. Was very cautious about buying this because of how much people went on about its difficulty. I am SO glad I did!What a fantastic game! yes it’s unforgiving but I am now seeing that is the fun of it. It genuinely gets my heart racing and I can feel myself learning from my mistakes. On top of that it’s beautiful and melancholy and I highly recommend playing with headphones because the audio is sublime.
150,artemilka,"Dec 13, 2020",10,Мне понравилось очень хорошая игра так как не потеряла всю хардкорность этого жанра и атмосферу
151,bbsriad,"Dec 13, 2020",9,"The game is amazing for someone that didn’t play the original and a good souls game.It is a game where you need to choose wisely on how you approach your enemies. Any monster can kill you and you can kill any monster if you are patient enough.The only negative point is that the game doesn’t warn you or hint you that you shouldn’t use certain items as you won’t be getting them again until your 2nd run. It is part of the game but it would be nice to add small warning before using something that has more use somewhere else. Simply the game is amazing and makes you come back to it every time you die with the fast loading screen, you won’t be quitting easily, but sometimes taking a step back will help you assimilate the strategy needed to defeat certain enemies, the game  shines at Performance mode introducing capped 60fps with amazing graphics on PS5. Must to play."
152,StalkerMT,"Dec 15, 2020",9,si la saga souls te gusto este titulo es simplemente obligatorio para ti POSITIVO-la personalizacion mejora mucho respecto a anteriores titulos de la saga-el combate es fluido-los jefes son impresionantes-la ambientacion es buena-el apartado grafico es increible al igual que las texturas NEGATIVO-El precio a dia de hoy es muy alto-probablemente si finalmente es lanzado en pc su rendimineto sea mucho mejor-no consigue la atmosfera siniestra del titulo original de ps3-los jugadores esperaban mas de este remake
153,NikitaKhirinski,"Dec 15, 2020",10,"The first project by Hidetaka Miyazaki came out absolutely unique.  The experience from which he himself draws inspiration, over and over again returning to the ideas laid down here.  I was surprised to find that in each of Miyazaki's next games there are echoes, references and outright borrowing from DemSouls. The game is chamber-based, but due to the well-thought-out game design, it is impossible to pass it quickly from the first playthrough.  The art design of everything is also striking.  Only for the sake of it is worth enduring all the pains of passing, because the design and stories in the game are engraved in the memory forever. From the pros: design, flexible roleplaying, world stories, a variety of locations, bosses and small enemies, each boss has an unobvious weak point, in some places music. Disadvantages: in places poor optimization, crookedness, in places unbearably complex game design (locations and placement of enemies are some of the most difficult in From games, while bosses are almost all easy), little usable music, some gameplay features (quickly breaking weapons, cutting HP)  , no bonfires between bosses, you have to farm a lot. One of the main, at the moment, PS3 exclusives, not devoid of flaws and curves, but with a unique face, which later became a phenomenon and one of the most important, complex and deep games of recent years."

155,MichaelChill,"Dec 20, 2020",10,"The game itself is a MUST, the original I mean. They have done an amazing work with the remaster. It runs solid as a rock at 60 fps making a big pleasure to play it. Graphics are outstanding and the quick loading of the maps and the nexus gives a very pleasant feeling during all the game. For me is the best PS5 game you can play at this moment."
156,KeeperDV,"Dec 23, 2020",10,"Magnificent journey that brings challenges hard enough to throw you into the spiral of joy. The remake has redefined many aspects of the game but those are mostly small details and changes that will be noticeable to the true veteran of the game. The lore still gives so much by telling so little , some bosses question the  very purity of your journey and the final difficulty crescendo is a cherry on a pie. The Old One. The Maiden in Black. And you, the slayer of demons, eternally bound to the nexus. It’s strangely fresh and visually stunning thanks to the next gen. Must buy. And of course remember, you have a heart of gold and don’t let anyone take it from ya."

In my opinion this is a good welcome to the new generation of PS.

If like me you have never play to Demon's souls before this remake on PS5, when you start the game you will be annoying by the difficulty of this game and you will surely want to resell this game because it is to difficult. But if you decide to continue, you will understand the incredible pleasure that this game brings."

In NG+ every enemy 2 shots you and it's not even fair, the level design is also super mid, so confusing and always getting overwhelmed. This does not even compare to any soulslike game, every enemy is a tank and 2 shots you, do not buy this game and it does not deserve a 92 rating."

164,VGConsoleAPE,"Sep 27, 2021",10,The launch title that singlehandedly took a dookie on Xbox Series X! I know Phil was in shambles when this one got announced. An incredible from the ground up remake of the game that started it all. Incredible presentation and audio with tight controls and fantastic gameplay. This is a must play for all PS5 owners! Great work Jim Ryan.
165,Talitor,"Dec  4, 2020",10,"A proper evolution of a classic game. With plenty of quality-of-life updates, it will feel just about as fresh as it did back in the day. The remaster missed a good opportunity to fix some of the issues that were very apparent in original Demon's Souls PvP, but purists would consider this being a good thing. With otherwise lackluster launch lineup, Demon's Souls brought it home. I can see myself playing this for years to come."
166,Fallen_Demon,"Nov 30, 2020",2,"Extremely meh and 70 dollars for this? How about 40? That would be more fair. I have nothing against souls games, but this one is just awful."

168,DoubleBlades77,"Nov 30, 2020",1,"It makes no sense to make Demon's Souls as launch title and then basically that's it for like 2 months? Really Sony? U serious? Well i didn't like it and now i'm like, time to play Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077 i guess."
169,CourseCorrectio,"Nov 30, 2020",1,"Souls games have actually really small audience and i mean people who actually like to play them not use immortality mode on PC. Whoever uses mods with these games to get past bosses is not actually fan of these games. Whole point of these games is that you die 100 times on one boss until you beat it and then you move on to next boss to die another 100 times. Not many people care about this type of gameplay and to most people it's just absolute time waste and generally not fun. I'm one of those who finds these games extremely boring and just complete waste of time and enegery. If someone likes them, that's fine, but like i said it's actually pretty small audience who really like these games. I think Bloodborne is different because they actually went deeper with that one and made overall world more interesting, so that's why it was obviously more popular. I also like Bloodborne and it's also only souls game i really care about. Demon's Souls remake is most basic souls game you can ever find. It manages to be more boring than any other souls game ever and after playing it for 4 hours i just gave up, it was so pointlessly repetitive."
170,Darkvenom39,"Apr  7, 2021",9,"FAN FREAKING TASTIC!!! I just enjoyed every bit of it from start to finish and NG+.This game truly delivers on where the souls franchise could go on next with the new generation of hardware. 4K 60FPS and advanced textures make it seem so beautiful and the attention to detail is brilliant!If you own a PS5, then this is a MUST BUY! even if youre not much into souls games you still need to check this game out. It truly sticks to the root and original and delivers more to it with added stuff and secrets.Overall as someone who has played many souls games and im jumping into the father of souls games for the first time, i have to say that i am truly amazed! Tho one drawback why it isnt a 10 is because the game instantly sends you to NG+ after finishing the game. So if there were items and sidequests you wanted to check out before you finish the game then you would have to do everything all over again. To i dont mind to be honest lol its such an amazing game and a very amazing experience."

Some weapons and armors are locked exclusively behind the Digital Deluxe edition, and that is a really **** practice.Anyhow, bravo for BluePoint."

180,Myp00,"Jan 30, 2021",4,"Not a good first ""souls"" experience.   I'd preface by saying I like challenging games.  I usually crank the difficulty up to the max.  Grounded mode, Give me God of War, nightmare, survival, whatever.   So, I was looking forward to a challenging game.This was the absolute wrong kind of challenge.  I can't believe there's no tutorials.   I know it sucks to jump into a familiar game and have your hand held for 2 hours but not everyone is familiar.  What are these holograms running around?   What's with these messages?  Why doesn't it pause?  Just a brief sampling:  I got stuck in the first zone.  I see the huge door.  Can't go right, only left.  So I go left.  It circles me around back to the door.  A message says ""try fire.""  On this door??  Ok... so I use a firebox by going into my inventory and selecting use and it automatically lobs it in the direction I was facing.  That will be even more useless in combat than it was on this door.   So, like a desperate fool, I light my sword on fire and try hitting the door.  The message said try fire, I'm trying... I do back through the left path and find the lever.  Had to work up the nerve to pull it because 2 messages said to pull it so there was a solid chance it was a trap.  I get through and kill the pokey shield blob easily.  So, I go back to the nexus.  New girl says the monumental will explain.  I ran around for 15 minutes till I lucked into noticing the talk notification as I ran by the kid.  Why wouldn't that trigger automatically or be more out in the open?  Whatever, let's press on.  I continue through the zone and make it to the tower knight.  Die instantly of course and now I have to run the gauntlet again.  I get back and last longer.  Kill the archers on the stairs, even got some hits in.  Noticed his leg is shooting out blue or something but died without doing much else.  Gotta run the gauntlet again.  Died on the way so I just went to bed not in the least bit wanting to play more.  But I gave it another go this morning.   Tried some other zones.  I hate all the tight corridors.  I just kind of hate the game.   Different strokes and all that I guess.  But this is just not for me."

I played the original way back on the PS3 and was worried that this one would ruin my fond memories, and was kinda reluctant to buy it, but dam I am glad I did. It is definitely going down as one of my favorite games of all time. The controls are crisp, and the fact you can move in 360 degrees as opposed to the 4 directions of movement in the original is amazing... Umbasa!"

186,zhribovanact,"Mar 31, 2021",2,"While the graphics is stunning, the gameplay sucks on the PS5. The game has a really weird target auto-focus [with R3], which is annoying, and the stupid camera turns all the time, leaving you vulnerable. I'm fine with the game being hard, but for the love of God, it needs more checkpoints. When you die, you start from the beginning and lose all souls, which sucks, I sold the game because I thought it would be more n00b friendly. This is also my first souls game. TL;DR:- Game is too difficult- Lack of checkpoints, you start from the beginning when you die, which sucks.- Auto-focus target controls are awkward. + Graphics"

197,kushlordtessema,"Dec  1, 2020",0,"Terrible game to get introduced to a terrible lore and a waste of $70, if PS5 is going to have exclusives only do them right. Lock on mechanic is garbage, first time playing a souls game and they introduce you to nothing, they throw you into a world you have no clue about and what is going on besides a few minutes of prologue. They tell you nothing about magic, spells, all that other bs, I don't even know who half these people in the Nexus or when they even joined me. So many questions I have about the gameplay but the game breaks nothing down, I am tired of going through articles having other real humans help me where the devs could not. What are tendencies? Why are there red guys in the game who are overpowered and one shot me all of the sudden? what is a white and dark sould tendency? Why did they not cover it? Why is it hard to find staffs for magic and they never tell you directly how to use magic? Why is the loot system bland to the point where I am using the same weapon 24/7 because nothing good drops from bosses, or challenging areas etc. A complete joke. Overrated. This is the first game in the series; at least introduce me to some mechanics besides the basic run, attack, and dodge buttons. The lore is uninteresting, no codex, no AIs that matter, a protagonist that is silent and gets ragdolled half the time. Random crashes, hardly no improvement from previous game from what I heard.. They confused hard with tedious, they think being a pain is hard but in reality the game is tedious and straightforward: stab, dodge, stab, dodge, block, no combos, not set up, hardly any mobility...I do not have the time to grind in a boring, bland world with bland characters, no music, no story, no real interesting armor/weapons or lore, with mechanics you have to search up, no map of any sort resorting to you running around a dungeon until you die because you were supposed to go through a small unmarked door way the entire time, no objective lists telling me what to do in the world besides running around clueless. Am I the main character? Why do I feel like I am playing as someone who is a complete skill-less nobody? This game is the forefront of this generation and it is a remake.. not only that but a remake that lacks everything a remake needs. Do not tell me people hyped this mess up because it has a rep for being hard, even though it is tedious and feels like an unrewarding errand simulator where I grind and die until i reach a boss I have no clue about. Also wanted to note the boss of 2-2 is weak only to magic, died 6 times only to find out online that was the case, you know, because the lazy devs told me nothing about magic let alone the weakness of a whole boss. Literally the laziest game made by developers. Tedious combat with no combo system, just oriented around stab dodge and block, or just use magic. No lore, no introduction to mechanic, no map of any sort, no new AI mechanic, no convincing characters, this literally feels like a game that's missing a bunch content."
198,Maxkho,"Nov 15, 2020",7,"I feel like both the praise and the criticism are valid. It is true that the game's graphics are amazing, as is as the artstyle, as is the loyalty to the original game as far as core gameplay goes. On the other hand, it is also true that the game is soulless, repetitive, and feels much more like a glorified Mortal Kombat campaign than a true fantasy RPG. Overall, though, I'd say that if you know what you are signing up for (which is taking down some bosses and NPCs in a Souls-like fashion and environment), this game is 100% worth getting, and it will probably exceed your expectations due to how good the presentation is and how well it plays; but don't expect it to captivate your soul or provide some unique gaming experience, because that's clearly not what the developers were going for when they made this game."

200,Reyesarsenal9,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Perhaps one of the best launch-games in PS-history. An amazing game and maybe the best remake ever made. Never been a fan of souls-game, but this one was something I had to play. Must buy for PS5."
201,Chesare,"Nov 16, 2020",10,The game looks and feels incredible. Playing it at solid 60fps and with dualsense is a complete next-gen experience. Those ppl rating it negatively are just pathetic and completely envying the fact of not being available on their favourite plasticbox. They haven't got the game nor play it either. They just typing whatever excuse they find to try and unrate the game just because their favorite plastic box barely's got games rating over 60's. They must seriously seek for professional mental help.
202,Obliivious,"Nov 16, 2020",10,One of those games that you will get better and better if you keep practicing.  This is a masterpiece.  I love it.  Definitely check this one out
203,Wesker1234,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"This is an amazing game if you are playing it for the first time and a great homage to the original game. It has everything fans loved back in 2009 but with new features. The first thing people will notice is the visuals, it has the best next gen graphics seen yet, if you are looking for a game that will make you stand still just to admire the level design and beauty of this somber world. The gameplay is pretty much the same as the original with some new additions like improved animations and new bosses and weapons to use, offering the unique and revolutionary souls like experience with difficult enemies and bosses to fight, which requires a lot of patience and skill to progress, remember, each death is supposed make you learn, not punish you. The game also has a choice for people who prefer fidelity or performance offering a 60 fps experience, not usually common in previous console generations. Of the biggest feature of the PS5 can be found here, which is a fast as hell loading time, this is one of the reasons why this game feels next gen compared to previous souls games. Overall the best experience you can get on these next gen consoles of you are a hardcore gamer, offering an amazing experience to newcomers and fans of the original game."
204,Gokus1stReview,"Nov 15, 2020",10,Incredible looking. Awesome gameplay. What more needs to be said?Bluepoint knocked it out of the park with this remake!

208,baba-man,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"I became a souls fan after playing Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I always wanted to play Demon's Souls. This remake is such a thing of beauty. They kept everything from the original and did some quality of life changes. The graphics are phenomenal and undeniably the best graphics in a game that exists currently. The sound design is phenomenal and really brings to life the Kindgom of Boletaria and other places in this game. Shrine of Storms is such a treat visually and in audio, as well as Valley of Defilement which is equally oppressive and soul crushing. I am phenomenally impressed by this game. I am a veteran souls player having finished Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1 and 3, and this game still is not easy. The levels are hard and one has to be really strategic. Dying and going through an area is still so much fun as the loading is almost non-existent. Some people are putting negative comments without playing the game. Don't judge it until you play it. Even those who are difficult to please really love it like VaatiVidya."
209,souldestroyer,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"In a medium where everything is John Wick, Demon's Souls Remake is Schindler's List. And just like that movie, there were times when I wasn't sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful. With moments you NEVER find in video games. But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you'll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air. That's saying a lot. I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget it. DS Remake is a game that will change you. In short, DS Remake put me through hell. I did not enjoy it. I wasn't supposed to. I was affected by it.  Like no game before. I am in awe of it. I am recovering from it. By the way, I saved 5 hours of my lifetime thanks to the shorter loading times. I invested the hours wisely in intellectually challenging books."

212,Teslacooler,"Nov 16, 2020",9,"This game is nothing short of incredible. It's probably the best looking game on a console right now and it's a remake of a PS3 game. Some artistic decisions like the soundtrack and visual atmosphere have changed slightly from the original. The original developers had nothing to do with the project, so I think it's commendable that Bluepoint was able to go as far as they did while keeping the base game's tone relatively intact. You can tell it wasn't for lack of effort either. The amount of detail and effort on display is staggering. With gameplay, I would say it is extremely faithful to the original. To a fault. The core combat is unchanged, in fact it's running the same code from my knowledge. This means that things like instant backstabs are still there, which could have been tweaked. Still, the original's core combat was exceptional and still holds up today. Additions like omnidirectional rolling, faster ladder climbing, limits to healing items you can carry, and a tweaked item burden system are welcome additions that improve the gameplay sandbox. Besides some missed opportunities and mistakes, I think Bluepoint knocked this out of the park. I would highly recommend this title if you have a PS5 and any interest in the Souls genre."
213,Metallicum,"Nov 14, 2020",10,I have moved from Xbox to PS this gen and this is my first game on PS... What a game! Graphics are art and playability with the new duo sense is dope. I never had anything similar in 7 years on Xbox. Glad I moved and I feel sorry for the Xbox user who are giving a 0 or 1 rating as they wont be able to play any decent exclusive in years!
214,tdebug,"Nov 26, 2020",0,"2008/2009 year game which is as annoying as it is repetitive. If killed, you would need to start a level from the beginning, die before end and repeat. Nice fun, if you have no life and endless free time. Yes there is a phenomenon called “souls fan”, but look at it from a different perspective - this game doesn’t even have a proper story. It feels like there is something big hidden under all those tremendously pompous and puzzling NPC speeches, but then you realize it’s almost nothing there at all. Just clumsy mechanics, lack of savings and often weird camera angles which make this game impossibly difficult."

I doubt people realize this but this game is probably one of the biggest launch titles in any console.10/10 would recommend."

I've beat dark souls twice, Bloodborne once and dark souls 3 once which was my favourite. didn't like ds2 and ran out of steam on sekiro. I didn't play the original Demon Souls, but this remake is absolutely genius. To me, a more casual from player, it feels like a true sequel to Dark souls 1, with the slower paced combat combined with beautiful next gen graphics and the best animations in a souls game to date. It feels new but familiar, and it honestly has the potential to be up there with ds3 for me."

In the other hand, the bosses seems a little bit simple in the way that their moveset is kind of limited.At the end of the day, the game it's a REMAKE of the First Souls, so I already expected Demon's Souls PS5 to not to be as deep as the Dark Souls Saga games."
238,Denisking12,"Nov 14, 2020",10,Defently the best remake ewer this game has the most next gen graphics ewer
239,MarioR,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Increíble puesta al día, respetando los elementos del original, pero gráficamente espectacular. Blue Point ha tocado los justo para que el gameplay no se notase anticuado, como el arreglo de la cámara y la implementación del rodado en 8 direcciones (antes era 4). Además han añadido un grandísimo modo foto y un editor de personajes muchísimo mejor que los que incorpora From Software. En definitiva, este juego no solamente es igual de bueno que el original, sino que lo mejora en muchísimos aspectos. Trabajazo por parte del estudio con el que nos traen de vuelta uno de los títulos mas influyentes en la historia de los videojuegos."
240,ElowBosak,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"This remake looks fantastic, beautiful graphics, I'm impressed that raytracing has not been ultized in this game. Lighting system is one of the best I've ever seen in games. There are some things I didn't like, such as the soundtrack, they changed compared to the original, that I really didn't like, I also didn't like the look of some bosses, I also found the game relatively easy. But it's still the best game of the new generation."
241,TiffanyStarrxxx,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"If you're a fan of the original, or love Soulsborne games you owe it to yourself to pick up this remake. It's just like the original, but with a better UI, gorgeous visuals, and more fine tuned gameplay. It's not for the faint of heart,  but if you like exploration and a bit of a challenge you'll love this."

The people who are rating this game poor and either brain dead, Xbox fan boys, finding it too hard or just being trolls. They have no clue. The game is a dream and can easily be game of the year. So don't listen to these people rating the game poor and saying bots are rating this game amazing because these are the trolls who are rating it bad. Ignore them, they clearly don't have a clue about anything. Regarding to why it should of been left on PS3.. well why would people who have never played it go and buy a PS3 to play it? Next gen graphics and totally same gameplay but better. Then this is a treat. Hand on heart the is one of the best games I have played and if your lucky enough to of got yourself a ps5 then you certainly won't regret this game... Only a bit frustrated from dying lots."

Demon's Souls Remake looks stunning, sounds ominous, and feels silky smooth unlike many of From Softwares poorly optimized games that regularly have severe frame rate problems.  Highly recommended!"

266,Ahsankkjjaa,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Amazing game and excellent launch for the new generation of consoles. This and miles morales are the only games that feel next-gen and it's easy to dismiss it as a remake when Xbox launches with absolute Nada, nothing. A little hard but that's the fun of it.

274,RiverutsGames,"Nov 14, 2020",10,8 hours in. One of the best games I've ever played and definitely the best next-gen looking game. Bluepoint Games are wizards. It kept the feeling of the original PS3 Demon's Soul. Highly recommended! A must play launch title. Ignore the low rating numbers. These are just pathetic Xbox fanboys who are jealous of PlayStation. Because Xbox fanboys have nothing to play except old games which they already played.
275,Aaalmubark,"Nov 13, 2020",10,One of the best remake ever. Blue point took the game to the next lv with stunning 4K and up to 60  FPS

If you dont have anything to play it is not Sony's fault it's Microsoft's."

284,Lluunutic,"Nov 14, 2020",10,Absolutely amazing. Words can't describe how great this masterpiece is. Everything from the graphics to gameplay has been done right from bluepoint. Hands down the best type of game in its genre and its next gen!

287,NickLJ,"Nov 13, 2020",8,"Nice game. The best Souls in graphics and art, but, Bluepoint failed in many easy things like the HUD, the soundtrack and some character modeling, ruining part of the essence. Anyway, this is probably one of the best Souls ever made, and that´s something amazing"
288,IamaWizardAMA,"Nov 13, 2020",9,"Overall, a better game than the original, and that's saying something. Though the original holds a place in my heart, the remake will be the one I'm coming back to time and time again from here on out."

291,eboke,"Nov 15, 2020",10,Unbelievable remake. Bluepoint has done a fantastic job. It is the best game visually I have ever played. WHAT A GAME !!! Haters...
292,gq_foine,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"DISREGARD ALL 0!  I enjoyed all the Dark Souls, except 2, Bloodborne and Sekiro!  And this one is by far the hardest (except Sekiro) and most enjoyable experience since it has no checkpoints and you have to go through the entire labyrinth to get to the boss fight each time. It is a mental grind..  But the satisfaction you get after you clear the boss after your heart is pounding is exhilarating!!  I think the PS5 version seems easier and it maybe because it's 60FPS with NO stuttering, virtually no load time. I LOVE The game so much I was up till 3am playing ALL day!  If you enjoy FromSoft games do NOT miss this one! It's AWESOME!   The remake is mind blowing graphics and sound!  The 60FPS is gloriously smooth. This is such an amazing game and enjoying this so much!  I love the graphics, UI and gameplay!   It's been so awesome!  Over 15hrs and 6 bosses down already and more to go!   Best graphics on any game I have seen!  If you have a 4K with 120hz this game is mind blowing!  Playing it on the 77inch OLED TV is just amazing!"
293,Mr_RoOoNee,"Nov 16, 2020",10,Wow thanks for bluepoint for the great job they did the game is amazing 10/10 for me and when its work on the beast there no word can describe it

295,ChairmanPrescot,"Nov 14, 2020",10,I have been playing this for 11 years. It was always an unkown gem. This the art that created a genre. A truly classic which everybody has to try. Now it is more accesible for new comers and it is better than ever.
296,doug10_troiano,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Bluepoint novamente fazendo um excelente trabalho com remake de Demon soul trazendo uma nova experiência na franquia souls melhorando aquilo que já era excelente no game do ps3.

Demon’s Soul Remake is amazing!! Everything is faithful to the original, but they made it even better!! Animations, textures, lights, mechanics, music etc!"
301,Logan_L1V3S,"Nov 15, 2020",9,"Incredible remake! I’m having such a good time with this game, it’s absolutely stunning and combat is much more fluid than meets the eye. I see a lot of user reviews stating they ruined the original and absolutely baffled that this game is getting anything less than a 6 by these hardcore originalists, it makes no sense for a game that has kept 98% of things intact. The only changes are the significant aesthetics and quality of life improvements. It’s no where of a deviation to the original, but to each it’s own. This is a must buy for sure (if you’re into punishing games!) The only thing stopping me from giving it a 10 is the HUD, wish it was modernized as it clashes a bit with everything else."

306,NYCITY,"Dec  1, 2020",1,Some people actually think this is good? Bloodborne is my favorite game of all time and i sold Demon's Souls after finishing it. How can anyone even recommend this? I'm so confused.
307,Exlee3000,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"To all the xbots giving this game a zero or a 2 or 3, I say to you , get a life.  For real.  I'm sorry your company doesn't give a crap about making any good games for you at launch.  The care and love that went into this remake us astonishing.  And yes it's a remake because they remade every single asset from the previous game.  This is the game that started it all and I love how bold and quirky this game is!  No hand holding here.  And the art direction and music is out if this world.  Never has a game given a feeling of such accomplishment.  When you finally beat a troublesome demanding boss you know you earned it.  And it will almost always be accompanied by a loud hell yeah.  The game is an all time classic.  Just know what you're getting into.  This game demonstrates the old adage, you can accomplish anything when you put your mind to it!"

319,BrunoBucciarati,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Bluepoint just prove that they’re the best studio for remakes give them any game and they will do it justice, not just demon souls feels fresh but they manage to keep it authentic like the original one but make it feel different in the same way. Not only the graphics are awesome but many upgrades and life fixes are made that make it unique I love this game. As a souls fan having platinum every fromsoft game this is a remake clearly made by a studio who is a fan of the franchise and made it for the fans. Best launch title ever."

The atmosphere, the voice acting, the world I have never played before, going into this souls game for the first time has me frantically hoping to play even more than I should. So far, I’ve come to the point where I’m at the prison and I can’t even describe the feeling I get discovering the unknown, reading the silly notes people leave around the world. I can’t stress this enough guys, first, get your hands on a ps5 lol, then... GET THIS GAME"
327,NinnjaCone,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"Um dos melhores remakes disparados já feito, a Bluepoint conseguiu pegar o conceito do game original, e aprimora-lo de sua maneira, sejam em uma soudtrack totalmente reformulada, gráfico refeito do zero e upgrades em relação até a própria gameplay ( como a camêra zoada do original...)E ainda por cima ele colocaram diversas opçãos que trazem os aspectos artisticos do game original, seja os filtros e ost. ( caso na edição deluxe)Concerteza para quem vai se aventurar pela primeira vez em Demon Souls, eu recomendo muito a compra , e até mesmo para quem apenas quer se relembrar mais uma vez do game de 2009."

342,Lukr34,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"I’ve never reviews a game here before but after finishing it I felt compelled to. I am personally a big souls fan and have now played all of them, demon souls being the only one I hadn’t played before. This is arguably the best remake out there. Blueprint did a fantastic job bring this game into the next generation. It keeps the soul of a souls game and seems to be true to the original. The combat is solid and fun, the sound design at time is incredible at immersing you I it the game with the 3D audio. Graphics are probably the best I have ever seen. I played in performance more and never got any frame dips, I would recommend not playing this in cinematic mode, I could tell any difference out side of slightly higher resolution. If you like a challenge and are on the fence about getting this game I absolutely recommend it. I now understand why people call blue point the king of the remake."

It kept the timing and coding that made the original play so well but added enough new touches to the world to make it feel NEXT GEN.

Un remake NECESARIO. Y toda esa gente que tira hate señalando lo que para ellos son ""algunos errores"" y después acompañados de un 0 como nota final por favor, maduren y dejen de actuar como imbéciles"

387,toddb360,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"fantastic remake still as fun as the original and just as challenging, one of the most impressive looking games and a true showcase for next gen"
388,Cless,"Nov 15, 2020",10,Demon's Souls is a very special game. It's the game that kicked off the Souls style of games. It's very experimental and does not shy away from throwing players off. So many great ideas for its time. And BluePoint did an amazing job and fixed the one issue the old game had; framerate. It runs so fluidly in the performance mode at 60fps.  There are some weird re-designs for sure. But overall it's amazing. One thing that should be noted is the diffculty. While this is a challenging game.. it isn't as hard as some of the later games in the series. It isn't a walk in the park by any stretch of the imagination but it's also not the hardest souls game. Overall it's as amazing as I remember it and better for the most part. Definitely a must play for fans of the souls style games.

394,Kingofmodernwar,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Nos encontramos con uno de los mejores remakes del ultimo tiempo, Bluepoint hace mas que justicia a este clásico de PS3, sino que ademas se da el lujo de mejorarlo en varios aspectos, cuidando el mas mínimo detalle de lo original para que no pierda su esencia. Mejor soundtrack y aprovechando el audio 3D de PS5 se logra una mayor inmersión. Dejando de lado lo que es gráficos y rendimiento (los cuales son increíbles), en resumen, como fanático de FromSoftware aplaudo el trabajo de Bluepoint para revivir esta obra maestra y darle una oportunidad a nuevas generaciones de jugadores para que disfruten lo que fue y significó para la industria un juego como lo es Demon´s Souls. Umbasa"
395,Glanzmann100,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Demon Souls é uma obra de arte, um dos maiores jogos da geração do Playstation 3 agora com um remake impecável, o jogo se mantém bem fiel ao original do Playstation 3 apenas mudando em alguns aspectos como por exemplo a musica de batalha contra os chefes, mas apesar das pequenas mudanças o jogo entrega uma diversão muito grande, o jogo contem também alguns troféus bem diferentes do que no original como por exemplo os troféus de desafio contra os chefes que mostraria uma forma alternativa de derrotar os chefes trazendo assim um desafio ainda maior esse jogo mostra uma historia muito bem elaborada, ótimas musicas, e uma bela direção de arte recomendo esse jogo a todos os fãs de jogos do genero.

401,ringoluo,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"I first played demon souls 12 years ago, and it was one of my few PS3 games. i remembered that I spent a lot of time beating the first level and had to use a glitch on the last boss because it was too hard for me back then. When I played the remake on PS5 launch day, I didn't die once before beating the first boss. Suddenly all the memory comes back along with the game. It is such a loyal recreation of the old game and I still enjoy every moment of it."
402,Poax,"Nov 18, 2020",10,"A classic, brought to back to life for PS5. Will be enjoying this over the next few weeks "
403,Makaveli,"Nov 15, 2020",6,"I'll just state that I've been a fan of the Souls series before anyone even knew what Demons Souls was. I remember seeing the game back in 2009 in the store and bought it because of the cool cover it had and have been a souls fan ever since..Now I want to say that the graphics look great BUT the atmosphere in the game does not feel like Demons Souls, you can tell it's missing something and that is the Fromsoftware touch.. I also do not like how the player character says "" ha ha huh huh"" every time you swing the sword I know it's odd to say but it just doesn't fit in a Demons Souls game.I like the OST but it also does not fit Demons Souls, you do not feel the ""purgatory"" feeling of the music that the original had and wish that they had an option to play the game with the original sounds., it sounds more like Bloodborne.They made a lot of design changes but they kept the abusing of backstabs.. I just dont get why. The boss designs are great. A lot of people didnt like how the new vanguard boss looked but I dig it. I also dont think it's worth the price. Original - 9.5/10Remake - 6/10"
404,RafaelMota,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"A Blue point games respeitou muito a obra original Demons souls, manteve a essência e melhorou todo o restante, trabalho fenomenal, experimente esse jogo, se permita ter essa experiência incrível."

Taking an original game and remaking it with clearly better visuals and frame rate. The different filter modes are welcomed also. Having put in 460 hours on the original game, and 100% glad to jump back in again. Please for any real die hard fans of Demon Souls and Dark Souls, check out vaatividya on Youtube!"
415,Mdro,"Nov 14, 2020",10,This is the best looking Souls game I have ever played period. It performs just like any souls game so if you are a fan of them you will enjoy this game.
416,MavihsLH,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Honestly, a masterpiece. I'm concerned about the hate it's getting on metacritic, which is largely full of misinformation and possibly review bombing. Definitely baseless comments from people who haven't played the game. First up, it's a 1:1 re-creation. Meaning it does little to deviate from the original, and it doesnt have to. It's a remake, not a sequel, people should understand what it means before buying the game. Clearing some misconceptions,Does it have a buggy launch? Not really. It's possibly the most polished souls game you'll play on launch. Of course there are some cheesy exploits that have been overlooked, but overall, you can run an entire playthrough without encountering any.Is the art style generic, or worse than the original? No. Well this is subjective, but I quite liked the art style. It's insane how Bluepoint pulled off some good looking picturesque scenes with such high fidelity photorealism. Also if you dont like the art style, you can change the filters in the settings. Which give it a more ps3 look.There really isnt much I can add further, it's a solid game which isnt as brutally hardcore as other souls game, and I quite enjoyed it for that. It's a nice balanced experience that's perfect for casuals and veterans."

443,ArshiaGam1ng,"Nov 14, 2020",9,This was a very necessary remake and despite my worries bluepoint delivered.  Ps3 took a lot of games hostage back in the game and there were some areas that ran terribly on it. Im taking one point off because pre order bonuses and deluxe edition stuff is pretty scummy for a remake that already costs 70 bucks
444,Zorada,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Simply brilliant, they took an old game and made it all bright and shiny while keeping the originals focus. Yes some great quality of life changes but the core game is the same. Best console lunch title ever"

451,gamereviewer555,"Nov 16, 2020",8,"I think they did a great job with the remake.  Having lightning fast load times really made this game better because I often found myself warping around the levels often.  All the visual filter options are cool and the game looks great.I think it plays well but I did have a few minor glitches. My only issues are with Demon's Souls itself.  Playing a melee character is really difficult and not as viable as it was in Dark Souls 1-3.  I had to start over and play a mage because otherwise the game is frustrating as heck.  But I definitely enjoyed it. I just don't think it's as balanced with the classes and customizations as Dark Souls.While there are some memorable and fun boss fights, they were definitely a lot easier than Dark Souls bosses. It felt like the levels themselves were more challenging here and just getting to the bosses was the real challenge.  I wish the end boss wasn't such a wimp. This game isn't worth $70 but when it's on sale I'd definitely recommend it."

467,Reinhard07,"Nov 19, 2020",10,"Es asombroso como despues de dos generaciones este juego que salio para PS3 pueda verse asi, graficos bien hechos, excelente sonido-musica y el dual sense mejoran exponencialmente la experiencia. los jefes de cada zona se ven geniales y con algunos detalles pudieron mejorarlos en cuanto su aspecto, sin duda vale la pena los 69.9 dolares. Recomendado para aquellos que si les gustan los retos y que sean fans de la saga souls o Bloodborne. No apto para los que buscan dificultad ""fácil"" y que quieran puntos de control cada 2 segundos."
468,GamingSanity,"Nov 13, 2020",10,Bluepoint really knocked it out of the park with this one stunning visuals smooth framerates and some tweaks to make it feel like a modern game all while staying true to the original game i'm really enjoying itI think it's time for sony to let them make something other than a remake because the talent is there.
469,EricHarmon,"Nov 15, 2020",10,The game that started it all. Now remade from the ground up for next gen. If you've been waiting to play demon's soul this is the definitive experience.
470,Dreyness,"Nov 17, 2020",10,"This game is amazing, very challenging, but incredibly rewarding, and of course it looks absolutely gorgeous. I am seriously shocked by how much negativity it's getting, well not really the internet is full of idiots, those people are obviously missing a bit too many brain cells. The ones complaining about the changes to the game's appearance probably haven't realized there are different visual filters in the display tab and one makes it look like the original PS3 version, I commend Bluepoint for caring so much to even put that in there for diehard fans of the original who are probably bashing them for DARING to remake their game. But as for the rest, ignore their stupidity, this game alone is enough of a reason to get the PS5, my guess is a lot of them are butthurt Xbots who are pissed they won't get a single exclusive for 2 years, who the heck else would hate on such an awesome game. Demon's Souls kicks ass!"

478,Timuriano,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Ремейк не устаревшей классики всегда актуален. Оригинал на третей плойке начал новый жанр в игровой индустрии, а теперь нам выкатывают идеальный soul like айпи, в который не стыдно играть на старте, в отличие от бокса( где нет игр на старте)"
479,tstempert,"Nov 23, 2020",10,"You mean, our characters will look like real people in a souls game?! Yup! Blue point games made an effort to stick to the intent and atmosphere of the original, and it shows. This is a good introduction to souls for those who have never played one before. In my opinion, to criticize this remake is to criticize the original.Very minimal changes. Not to mention, load times are cut substantially due to PS5 capabilities. The visuals are beautiful and the 3D audio sounds fantastic."
480,Chjko,"Nov 17, 2020",10,The game is so good the graphics look very beautiful the gameplay have improve a lot but still there some things make me disapointed like if you buy the 90 dollar editon you will be op at the begining of the game that just like pay to win but luckily those item cant be upgrade or else the game will become unbalance and unfair in the multiplayer pvp and the sixth archestone is not here i know they said they want to stay close to the original as possible but please can they ask from software to make the sixth archestone as a dlc that will be cool as hell
481,oscarg04,"Nov 14, 2020",10,Pure gaming joy. I loved the original and I love the remake. Now we need a Dark Souls 2 remake!
482,Eisennnn,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"I really really missed this game so much and being able to play it with better frame rate and graphics was just what I wanted, the game has the same core gameplay it had and it’s just improved with quality of life things that make it way more playable, and while i do miss the way some things looked it hasn’t bothered me much at all really, the game just feels amazing and the atmosphere is still the same that i loved back then. I do hope they fix some small pvp related problems with patches and stuff to make it easier to invade tho"
483,Clarkr13,"Nov 13, 2020",10,As a die-hard Souls fan you have no idea how happy this game makes me. I did not start playing Souls games until last year but when I did I instantly fell in love with them. The problem I've had since playing the original Dark Souls in January is that I was not getting that same feeling of nervousness terror and pipe all in one sitting that I did with the original Dark Souls from the follow-up titles Dark Souls 2 and bloodborne. I am happy to say however this Demon Souls remake really brings back that feeling and I cannot get enough of it.
484,Raios-Rogue,"Jan 31, 2021",10,I bought the deluxe edition of this game i wanted to experience Demon's souls the experience i missed back on PS3 the only problem i found with the game so far are the pop-in textures you can quickly see them on walls in fidelity quality cinematic native 4k 30fps mode and on the Tower Knight Boss Fight Bluepoint games didn't do a fantastic job using the PS5 ssd they barely tapped into the PS5's hardware power the user score droped so much xbots are ranking this game with 0 because they hating on this game because they badly want to play it all of their games are low quality garbage and demon's souls remake is top quality and their first next gen game The Medium flopped hard and some filthy casual gamers complaining the game is too hard and they wasted their money go play your fortnite this ain't a game for gamer casuals it requires patience and skill which you don't have because you plays games like minecraft CS GO Call of Duty Fortnite that are for retards anybody can play those games and you learn nothing from them they require 0% brain capacity usage to play you don't develop any skills from them except accuracy that's why you casuals suck and give up like a btch ass niga if you actually spent time to improve yourself and have patience you gonna beat this game and you gonna get better at it and feel great about it and some old school soulsborne veterans like myself i see in their reviews are complaining that the game lost Miyazaki's original vision and atmosphere what are you talking about my niga the game is even better now it hasn't lost anything in fact Bluepoint games improved on the Vision of Miyazaki they improved the atmosphere. here is my review and my honest opinion.this is a Incredible remake of a beloved gothic action role-playing game the mother of all games that gave birth to dark souls bloodborne sekiro nioh and that inspired many game developers to follow that Fromsoftware formula and create masterpiece game of the year games just like 2018 god of war.The best looking graphical next generation game in all of gaming history and it runs butter smooth with no performance issues only on PlayStation 5 thanks to Bluepoint's Phenomenal Job this is not just a remake but a re-vision without changing the core of the gameplay and the game itself 10/10

What happened? Ok, the game is Demon's Souls, love it or hate it.Visually it's the first step towards prerendered CGI of the generation, on any platform, not because of the PS5 hardware, but because it's the first game developed with the new pipelines, tools and mindset, shying away from the flat-clean-origami style that still pleagues art directions in games, covering the eyes of many players like slices of salami."

514,TimmyH,"Nov 15, 2020",6,"Is this still a great Souls game that was remembered by many? Yes! Does it play fantastic? Sure! But is this a good remake? I think not. It's really a shame that Bluepoint went with a new art direction that lacks subtleties and eccentricities which make the original game mysteriously gloomy. This is especially evident on the controversial design changes of some enemies. I don't write this to tarnish the amount of work they dedicated to the project, but a huge portion of the extra work is redundant. Some may argue that it's inevitable to be westernized. Well then hire more competent Asian artists with an Asian upbringing and aesthetics in Cthulhu and Japanese tentacle art. And some may say the original intent can in no way be fully understood because of the tech limitation that plagued the original. Well, just look at more recent Souls games like Sekiro, and see how far it's come since Demon's Souls in tech. Surely, Sekiro isn't a technically amazing game, but you can still get the idea how a proper gloomy, dark, morbid image should look with new techs. At the end of the day, the original will still stand high, because its art endures. And the remake is such a squandered opportunity, and SotC Remake is much better in comparison."
515,RatappPlays,"Nov 17, 2020",10,Veo mucha gente de PC y Xbox acá que están furiosos que el juego sea exclusivo de ps5 y se quieren morir y lo puntean con 0. Pobre gente. Gracias Sony por hacer un remake de este juegazo.  Gracias totales
516,Striker91,"Nov 14, 2020",5,"I know everyone was super hyped for this game, and having played most from software games I knew what to expect. Graphically a little underwhelming compared to some other next-gen titles, but as a remaster that is kind of expected. It won't strain your ps5 thats for sure. Gameplay is the same love or hate is souls formula, can be extremely frustrating but also rewarding at times. characters still feel overly clunky and like the game makes controlling your characters a bit of a pain at times. the frame rate compared to the original ps3 version is nice, but overall didn't blow my mind."
517,Hanzooo,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"A masterpiece, the game manages to bring the essence of the original 2009 Demons Souls and manages to do it with mastery, you can feel the same feelings that you would feel playing the original Demons Souls, stunning graphics, but with some texture errors occurring sometimes, that do not affect gameplay much, but it is a mistake and has to be said, the combat is insane, perfect! you feel like you’re really playing a souls-like game, incredible story and very well portrayed, with some additions but staying the same, for me, it’s the best remake and one of the best games of 2020"
518,Stercrazy,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"This game is amazing. I only played the original for a bit, but I have put in a ton of play on this game and I can honestly say that it plays great and above all, it is beautiful. A lot of the areas in the old game seemed rough and unfinished when I played them, but here every parts seem heavily expanded on and  developed. The worlds in this game feel alive and full of tiny details that you might miss if you aren't paying attention. Definitely a must buy game!"

523,eduslxedu,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Bluepoint knocked out of the park with their new remake ""Demon´s Souls"" its the dad figure of many games today most notorely Dark Souls, a multiplataform demons souls.Long story short, if you ever played demons souls, this code remains untouched, everything is right there where you remember, bosses can be defeated the same way as they used to 10 years ago, and that will please many fans, but its not just a lazy remake, bluepoint has gone the extra mile, i cant express in words about how good it looks, and how smooth it runs, maybe i notice a small drop or two in 20 hours of gameplay so far, but nothing really noticable (as a pc player i have an eye for this things), the sound makes use of the new 3d audio, and as an audio fan i can say that i see a loot of potential in this tech, its on point, maybe sometimes audio could lower its resolution, but then again, not really something that anyone can notice, and i believe this will keep evolving. On the controller, well, i think for the tone of the game bluepoint has nailed again, its not an expectacle like astro playroom, its more serious, you can feel how the trigger stops when the hit wont connect, or how it feels when you hit flesh, its just magical, and everyone should feel it, for me its a 9.8, but since metacritic wont let us use decimals, i have to give it the full 10 score. what a threat to start the new gen!"

531,Soulslayer2323,"Nov 13, 2020",6,"I am writing here just to prevent any misleading information in this reviews section. This remake is for those who never got the chance to play the OG Demon's Souls, and for the die-hard fans (some of them already hate the remake, because its different than the OG version of the game.) Demon's Souls was a game that majority of the gaming community at that time didn't even care to watch its gameplay videos, leave aside buying it. It was a different kind of game, and also underrated. Sony never gave this game enough credits and left it to rot. When they saw the potential of Dark Souls, they wanted a cut so Bloodborne came out. After that, they went dark for some time and later on announced the Demon's Souls Remake for PS5, because they learned the fact that Soulsborne games are quiet popular nowadays because people are sick and tired of the casual games that have no risk and reward factor. With this remake tho, they've dumbed down the game just to appeal to casual players, draw and bring them in so they can make a little bit more money. Die-hard soulsfans like me are definitely going to buy it so who cares about us right? Things that made Demon's Souls Demon's Souls isn't there anymore. Boss fights are hollywoodish fights that supposedly to be 'epic', but what made them so unique is gone, it's not in the game. Every boss you face has that dark opera theme music, even they tried to make Phalanx an epic boss fight. What I am saying is that If you never got the chance to play Demon's Souls in PS3, buy this game. If you had the chance, however, you can always buy it later because It's the popular game right now and you are not going to judge it properly."

There’s a few very minor changes I don’t agree with, but overall it’s a very faithful reimagining of the original game. All the mechanics are spot on accurate, which is important because combat is the most important aspect of a Souls title. The visuals of course, are stellar, one of the most gorgeous games I’ve ever seen. I can think of no better way to usher in the PS5 era than with this updated classic."

This is the first next gen masterpiece and if this is just scratching the surface of what the PlayStation 5 can do, then we are in for a treat this generation."
544,knightarturo,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Bluepoint has done a great job making the first souls game shine, including tasteful use of the new PS5 features such as haptic feedback.  You'll be convinced in world 3-2 when you can feel the giant brain creature pulsating through haptics as you get close.  Many more instances where just the right amount of feedback is given.  Hope to see more of this kind of use and less of what we got in Astro's Playroom.  Overall it's the most incredible remake of a game many already loved.  Um, Bloodborne next, please?"

579,djsponge10,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"To those rating this a zero. No game in the world deserves a zero, unless there is no game to play. But anyways hey what’s up souls veteran coming in my first souls game was this bad boy back in 2009. And it wasn’t even my favorite I rank the series bloodborne DS3 DS2 Sekiro DS1 Demons souls. But this remake is just the greatest thing to happen for this game the old game of course was very unstable and frustrating because of hardware limitations instead of being hard which is what should make a game hard. This fixes that and is still very challenging especially for someone who has beaten all of the souls games. I like to help people in bloodborne but now I feel I wanna do that with this one. Demons souls is now legit maybe my favorite souls game because of how great this remake s this is the greatest remake to ever be made. This deserves a 10/10 and for those losers voting this 0 because they think there are bots or are just jealous xbots STAY MAD kinda sucks for you that your exclusives like the falconers are a 69 and the break one is what a 54? Jealous little boys demons souls RULES"

585,ShellShock546,"Nov 14, 2020",10,Prais the Sun!  This game might be one of the best launch titles of all time.
586,Themaddoc,"Nov 23, 2020",10,"I waited 30 years to experience gaming like this and to do it with Demon souls is a joy. I feel lucky to have had a PS5 pre-order and Demon Souls pre-order to go with it. After spending 40 hrs so far in the game I can say it’s everything I wanted and more. They stayed true to the original game item placements bosses gear snd all. And if the older players like me wanted to experience the original with a touch up there’s different filters including Classic. So it will look as it did on the PS3 but with loading times so quick if you blink you will miss it. In 2008 I remember getting this from Japan as it we couldn’t buy it in the EU then, there was just these odd posts online on forums of this cult unforgiving game. I loved it and got the platinum one thing I didn’t was every time I died looking at the loading screen of a picture of one of the NPC for 60 seconds or more each time. Anyways this is about Bluepoint and I have to say to give this little known studio credits they have done the best remake I’ve seen since 30 plus years of gaming on the NES Windows 95 and through to this new current generation. Everybody goes on about Dark Souks but 85% of the current player base were late to the party. Demon Souls was the Father that birthed the soulsbourn games and it’s more unforgiving more mistakes or deaths. The more you die in human form the harder enemy’s get but more loot they drop. Or play through the game in soul form with 1/3 of the health 2/3 with a ring and when you die the world won’t change for the harder. But there pros to each as both ends of the scale each map will have 2 events tied to that mechanic. So do you have what it takes to take on Dark Souls big brother. Enjoy Bluepoint have outdone themselves and can’t wait to see what this generation has coming and what Bluepoint do next."

591,Sarulade,"Nov 13, 2020",10,My first time playing Demon's Souls and man it looks so good. I don't know how the original one felt but this game feels so freaking good. If you aren't a fan of Souls series like me you will still like it!! I'm loving it so far and couldn't wait to finish it!!
592,biggame,"Nov 13, 2020",10,I don't even know what to say... this game is amazing and the people who gave it a 0 are some salty people who don't have ps5 probably and I really feel bad for those that give the game a 0 without playing and I think this is a mental issue that they have. If you want my opinion I think that this game is amazing and you should definitely play it.

605,aimineye,"Nov 15, 2020",0,"It doesn't worth it. Just a remake, not remarkable at all. A waste of your money."
606,WewLad55,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Once again, Bluepoint sets the gold standard for remakes. This is a love letter to Souls fan. They didn't change a lot, but they changed what HAD to be changed. Omnidirectional rolling and the new healing system, as small changes as they are, make a significant difference in gameplay and massively improve it. There are only a few complaints, like how some bosses that really needed a rework are unchanged and how the OST uses waaaaay too many choirs sometimes (it's a great OST, don't get me wrong, it's objectively better than the digitally made original, as opposed to this one that uses a full orchestra, but they really go home with the choirs in way to many fights. I personally enjoy it, but I understand people that say it's too epic and exaggerated for Demon's Souls).And of course, if you don't like the way the game looks and prefer the feel of the original, they have a filter that makes the Remake's color pallete close to the 2009 original for that as well, so everyone wins. There's also the original camera and the new, cinematic one. I advise you to use the cinematic camera when fighting bosses, as it gives the fights an incredible feel, and use the classic camera when you're not fighting bosses (duh). The HUD/UI is a bit too simplistic. I personally don't give a damn about the UI looks as long as it's not Witcher 3 levels of convoluted, but the Remake one does look very much simplistic and it's not as attractive as the original. I also think the health/stamina/magic bars are too small and should be made bigger.Aside from all that, this is perhaps the greatest remake ever made and it deserves a high score."
607,Shaleb,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Bravo Bluepoint! Taken a masterpiece and made it better in every way ""which is very difficult to do"". Play this game!!!"
608,Jeabus,"Nov 13, 2020",6,"Much to my dismay it's not a remake. As much as they try to say otherwise it's a remaster at best or insulting at worst. Some might say ""Reforged"" levels of terrible. But of course it's the easiest game in the ""Official"" Souls-Like catalogue and has good grafix... so the big critics and youtubers are going to endlessly love and praise it. Especially since most of them probably never played the original. Unfortunately they did some things to the ""remake"" that can't be justified. I had a list but it became a 3000 word essay so I cut it. Suffice to say they completely botched this ""remake"" by doing tons of things literally because they felt like it or because it aligned with their political viewpoint. This is what happens when you give a Western non-developer the keys to a classic game in ""Current Year"". This is what happens when Sony moves their headquarters to California. It's sad. Playable, but it's depressing to see what happened to my childhood."

An absolute must buy for the any serious gamer."

614,korawan56l,"Nov 13, 2020",7,+ Stunning graphics+ improved controls+ DualSense features used right - Not seems to have any new worlds. Encounters are same as original game.- Soundtrack is downgrade. Let me choose to play with the old tracks please?- Questionable models of certain enemies and bosses. Overall buy if you enjoy Souls games.
615,salvadorpepe261,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"El remake de Demon’s Souls conserva todo el encanto de la saga, e incorpora un desarrollo enroquecido por numerosos detalles técnicos que lo convierten en una experiencia inolvidable. Los jugadores veteranos preocupados por la dificultad del mismo no tienen nada que temer: el título conserva el nivel de desafío de anteriores entregas. Tenemos enemigos que de tres tajos te vencen, trampas, emboscadas, zonas llenas de retos y jefes asfixiantes. El juego también conserva los espacios oscuros y reducidos, rodeados de barrancos, donde combatir implica el riesgo de que falles al atorarse tu espada en la pared, o erres el golpe y caigas al vacío. Pero la experiencia es embellecida con unos gráficos hermosos, un escenario vivo y una música estremecedora. De verdad, se trata del perfeccionamiento de la formula souls."

637,Digger311,"Nov 13, 2020",8,"The biggest con is the questionable redesigns of some bosses, NPC's, and enemies. Other than that Bluepoint did a very good job building upon the original. One of the strengths of the original DeS is how well the gameplay has held up over the years when even games like The Witcher 3 feel outdated after just 5. Bluepoint built on this strength, and through several QOL improvements and new animations made the game feel like a modern souls title. The environments and graphics look amazing, the customization and replayability of the original game are all there. This is an incredibly easy game to recommend and a great entry into the souls series."

645,maurist10,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Wow. What an incredible game. Bluepoint really overdid themselves. After Shadow I thought it couldn‘t get any better. But I was wrong. Amazing. Everyone who loves Souls-born games really should give his one a take. They took the already great original game and made it even better, with graphics never seen before on a console and a truly immersive experience. So far this is one of the best games of 2020 for me. And a lot will agree me on that one after they start playing this masterpiece. SO GREAT!"

649,Triloszn,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Okay first off this game is so good. The graphics are amazing. I really didn’t except the character models to look so good but they did a really good job. The gameplay is paced out nicely and leaves you wondering what’s around the next corner, it’s fairly challenging, most people will probably struggle with this. The bosses in this game compared to ps3 demon souls look so freaking cool, felt like I was actually fighting them. I highly recommend picking up this game with your ps5. "
650,Biohazard_dan,"Nov 13, 2020",10,An homage to the original game. An improvement in every way.  BLUEPOINT has outdone itself.
651,Boogy,"Dec  1, 2020",10,I'm speechless. This game is so good!One wouldn't wish for a better lunch title! Incredible!

658,Namus,"Nov 21, 2020",10,Amazing remake of an amazing game. Must play for any Souls fan and system seller imo.
659,MetaMach,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"One of the BEST remakes ever made, if you loved the original, you'll love this one. Must buy, and 2021 GOTY contender."
660,Hyper-Dash,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"I've never beaten the original game on the PS3, but today, with so much insights about the Souls formular that I've gained over the years and with the right mindset, I've finally managed to beat it. The game hasn't lost its appeal a single bit. There are deceptions and mysteries everywhere you go; nothing is ever quite obvious. This is the beauty of Demon's Souls. The combat is as tight as ever; BluePoint kept all the attack frames the same as the original so veterans will feel right at home. With 60fps, haptic feedback, and 3d audio this game has come back to life with new vigor and impressively demonstrates what we can expect for upcoming future titles on the PS5. I'm really hoping that FromSoftware will give permission to BluePoint again to remake the original Dark Souls. That's the only Souls game that I've never played, and I can't wait to get my hands on that classic with new technological improvements."
661,TalionSwift,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"This remake was great In my opinion. The Graphics are great, and the 60 fps is consistent and just feels very good. The spell effects and Haptics where great together and not gunna lie i wasn't sure how good the Haptics would be but having gone back to games without it just feels off, its amazing in Demons Souls. The games feels in alot of ways like the original and many they were not lying that the enemies have the same AI even replicating some of the weird things in the original. Now in some small ways they did change some small things that i liked in the original but still they did a bang up job overall."
662,BMX,"Nov 17, 2020",10,Another beautiful exclusive game for PlayStation 5 thank you for this masterpiece.
663,JoseofCatarina,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"I'm giving it a 10 because imo the original Demon's Souls is the greatest game ever made, and I think Bluepoint Games did a decent job with this huge undertaking. I hope everyone struggling with this game, is able to feel the huge sense of accomplishment after beating it, and then play the original."
664,RWAVY24,"Nov 17, 2020",10,Absolutely perfect game in every sense of the word it truly is a perfect game

668,Iudex20,"Nov 18, 2020",10,No **** agenda equals great game maybe Sony should take note and understand why FromSoft ditched their stupid asses
669,weturn,"Nov 17, 2020",10,плюсы графика офигенная музыка щедеврально  и отличная атмосфера  минусы почти нету
670,Sergio78,"Nov 18, 2020",9,"Incredible as they are, the Soulsborne often encountered technical limitations that testified to FromSoftware's limited means.With this remake of Demon's Souls, these restrictions are now being broken. Incandescently beautiful, the kind that will fall for the next-gen on a whim, this remake transcends From's dark fantasy with every new place it passes through. And when you also know all the masochistic pleasure it brings, all the gigantic challenges that await you, all the memories it brings back, you have only one desire: to force it between the pognes to (re)discover the power of the formula in the most beautiful of settings. Bluepoint Games has gone the extra mile to keep the experience almost intact while rethinking the overall ergonomics, with countless details that will delight veterans, and no doubt help the curious who will finally take the plunge - and what better time to do so.We also sometimes touch the limits of the remake exercise - if you still have a very precise memory of Demon's Souls, the surprise effect might be limited to the graphic part. But given the quality of the original game, that's not really a problem. When goldsmiths bend over a rough diamond, it's to make it the jewel in the crown."
671,JJTH,"Nov 24, 2020",10,De lo mejor para inicio de generación en PS. Fiel al original y un apartado técnico increíble ... buen juego.

674,Gamer4life1985,"Nov 18, 2020",10,"Wow... I personally can't believe the Xbox trolls on this one (or those poor saps that lost the chance to get a system)  Really?  Giving this game a 0, 2, etc.  You guys are dumb.  Grow the fu** up.  My god.  This game may be the original remade, and it lacks alot of mechanics that the later games improved on so I could see a 7, even a low 6 for being unimpressed by nothing being added; but because of these worthless bots running rampant I will give this a 10 (Which is would have given it a 9 otherwise.)"
675,lovefromhate88,"Nov 20, 2020",10,Remarkable remake. Ignore the negative reviews. To be honest i believe DS is the sort of game where you know one way or another if you are buying it.Stunning in every way
676,Johnny-,"Nov 23, 2020",10,"A classic reborn. Undoubtedly one of the best remakes ever created, it stays true to the original while still improving its archaic mechanics and making it more pleasant to play. The visuals are outstanding, Bluepoint Games has very talented artists and cutting edge tech. The best showcase of what early PS5 games should aim for."
677,robber_soul,"Nov 28, 2020",9,"Having not played the original, I can still easily say that Demon's Souls is one of 2020's best games, and the best reason to buy a PS5. It's beautiful beyond belief, it feels nice to play, areas are appropriately challenging, atmosphere is thick, and the online components of signs and summoning means the game is only as hard as you want it to be. Barring a few little outdated pieces of game design, some undeveloped bosses, and a few moments of BS, Demon's Souls is still fantastic."
678,elraphael81,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Piękny remake świetnej gry. Wygląda obłędnie, super klimat. Obowiązkowa dla fanów serii, a dla osób które chciałyby spróbować serii, to najlepszy moment ;]"

684,onfire1229,"Nov 25, 2020",10,"As a soulsborne veteran who has played all of FROM Software's titles multiple times, I can say that Bluepoint did a phenomenal job preserving the original vision of the game while brining it into the modern era. The mechanics are maintained and preserved (with some quality of life improvements that were very much needed) while the visuals and audio are updated in a way that makes the game far more immersive. I highly recommend this for everyone, whether you're a FROM Software fan or are new to the series."
685,lgqr17,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Extremadamente bello y le hace honor al original hasta lo supera, simplemente una obra maestra para empezar la generacion"

687,onlygamer,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Great game, one of the best remakes ever, the graphics, the animation, the sound, all is perfect"
688,Kumasimc,"Nov 13, 2020",9,"Once again I must point out that people posting Zero for their score have no business here. If you don’t like a game that’s fine, but a Zero just shows you’re a troll that no one can take seriously.Regardless, onward. Remaking a classic like Demon’s Souls is not an easy task. What do you change? What do you keep? Are there things that might not be great that are still essential to the experience? The devs have once again shown that they know how to modernize a classic while staying utterly faithful to its core. Much like Shadow of the Colossus, this will never replace the original, and I don’t think it aims to. One can easily still play the first, assuming you have a ps3. But not only is this an audiovisual treat for returning players, but a more streamlined entry point for newcomers. It’s still difficult, it’s still obtuse, it still has one of the most needlessly complex weapon upgrade systems ever, but it’s also the point where From took all of their knowledge from King’s Field and Shadow Tower and transmogrified it into what would become its own genre. Were it a brand new game, it would still be praised, as a remake it also deserves praise. It’s also going to be many people’s first time playing Demon’s Souls while the game is fresh and nobody has hacked it and duped their life away. The best time to experience the asynchronous multiplayer genius of Souls games, to me, is always towards the beginning, where we’re all in this together. So come, join, have fun, die a lot, call upon a stranger, leave a funny message, enjoy this masterpiece that went from swept under the rug PS3 game to Most Hyped Launch game for PS5 and see why it deserved a remake from Bluepoint in the first place."
689,Vidaloka118,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Que jogo incrível! Com certeza o melhor jogo da saga souls já feito, os gráficos estão absurdos, é um dos melhores remakes já feitis."
690,Skspikex2,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Tons of crying weak @$$ Microsoft fanboys trying to review bomb this game. So pathetic.Various video game journalists rate this game outstanding. And personally, it’s worth it."
691,viroodiem,"Nov 18, 2020",7,"While Demon's PS3 release is a generational defining game, sadly PS5 release is definitely not. Lets get this out of the way first. This is a REMASTER, not a remake. Many people seemingly have problem differentiating the two. A remaster is just a glow up of an existing game. Examples of this would be Final Fantasy 12 Zodiac Age, Shadow of the Colossus, Okami, etc. It will be roughly the same game, including using the original voice acting. A remake is rebuilt from the ground up and are FAR more rare because of the hefty investment involved with rebuilding a game is functionally not that different from building a new game from scratch other than having a blueprint to work from. With remakes you typically see whole encounters play out similarly but very different than their original and things like voice acting are created from scratch. I write this because there seems to be two wild camps here, both of which are kind of wrong in their rating. One is the camp 10/10ing the game, many of which did not play the original (as is evident in their reviews) and thus are giving the game a perfect score that is merely an echo of the perfection that was the original. On the flip side you have the 0/10 crowd who seemingly have fundamentally misunderstand what this release was going to be, and thinking it was going to be a remake. (although some negative scores are undoubtedly going to be from those scrubs that never played any of the souls games and just need to git güd as with all Maso/core games) Its importance to preface this to give proper context to this score and why other scores here are so way off the mark and basically useless. The graphics look slick and definitely a whole 9% better than PS4 graphics but ultimately thats the end of it. Its possible that had this been released in the middle of the PS5 life cycle that the graphic prowess might be as high as a 12% graphical improvement over PS4 graphics found in the likes of Sekiro or Dark Souls 3. There is effectively nothing else there to justify a 70$ price tag. Even if you are getting a launch PS5. In that sense what it does is serves as a VERY expensive tech demo for the early PS5 adopters. Essentially the ""more money than sense"" crowd. Even though that crowd is highly important to ensuring a console survives long enough to become profitable (looking at you, WiiU.) The problem with DSPS5 is that it does nothing new. Granted this is merely a remaster and not a remake (To that one dude talking about a ""reforged"", yeah, sorry but that is not actually a thing)  BUT there is absolutely no excuse for how high profile this entry was going to be to NOT add in the last pillar into the game. Bluepoint wanted to remain faithful to the original but if there was going to be no new content in the game the game should have only ran half its cost. All you are getting is higher resolution/framerate/texture/poly count and in the scheme of gaming, graphics are irrelevant to what makes a good game. So if you have never played Demon's, go ahead and get it. The game itself is outstanding. However if you have, then at best this is an honorific place in a library and I predict this will be one of those games that you will see for 10$ in gamestop bargain bins within a year to 20 months.... so long as Gamestop remains a thing. DSPS3 was a 10/10 game. It gets that score because a intangible part of what makes a game good is its moment in history. Remasters do not get that same luxury. Since 2009 an entire genre has been built around what DSPS3 set into motion and with it has been a host of advents and improvements to the genre. Those quality of life improvements are largely glossed over in the name of remaining faithful to the original. Sticking too close to the source material can be just as bad as it is good. The game looks pretty, it moves smoothly, There are SOME QoL improvments but it is VERY limited in presence and scope. it IS a slight improvement in ways not having the lag a PS3 would have BUT like it or not even those moments of lag ARE part of the experience. Think of it like how vinyl is viewed as superior to digital recording because of the ""warmth"" and that warmth being the tiny imperfections in the physical pressing of the record. The same is true here. So having a flawless, lag free experience is going to produce something more mechanical and a little less endearing than a 100% accurate flawless environment So it earns a 7 and to be honest 1.5 points of that are for nothing else than the hope that there will finally be DLC that adds in the missing pillar. (DLC which should be free I might add)  If that DLC ever does materialize then this score will be modified to an 8. Buy it now if you have never played Demon's before. Otherwise wait till it works its way down to a more appropriate 25-30$ range or it gets that last pillar DLC."

694,Deathboii,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"As a big soulsborne fan, I enjoyed this game. People who say it lost the ""atmosphere"" or isn't same as before are full of bs. I really hate the excuse of ""nostalgia"" they keep giving. Get over it; you'll never experience a game that you played before as if it was the first time. Anyway, I never played the original, but I've seen gameplay of it. And I wouldn't say I liked it. Same as dark souls 1, people also kept telling me its the best and most challenging soulsborne game. And when I tried it, it was the worst and easier compared to others. If you're a new soulsborne fan who has never played demon's souls, I recommend it to you. Though a little warning, ⚠️ it reminded me of DS2. Easy bosses but more difficult maps to walkthrough."

700,dlegassicke,"Nov 18, 2020",10,I've never played the original but as a fan of Bloodborne and Sekiro I absolutely adore this game. It's incredible to go back and experience the very first Souls game and see where the series started. Visuals are undeniably next generation running at your choice of 60 fps or 4k making this is an incredible way to start off the next generation of playstation. Well done Bluepoint Games.
701,Pyrucet,"Nov 14, 2020",8,"Visual, combat animation/mechanic and quality of life updates are exceedingly good. However, the new score and sound effects stray too far from the original and, while certainly loud and Hollywood-esque, are quite bland now. With the sound palette being pretty consistent over the entire souls catalog I don’t really understand why Bluepoint took such liberties there. The added NPC animations are generically terrible and immersion-breaking. Why bother bluepoint!? From didn’t. This game could have been a 10 if it wasn’t trying so hard not to be a 1:1 remake."
702,Rav3,"Dec 12, 2020",9,"Bluepoint Games has done a surprisingly great job of taking the grandaddy of Soulsborne titles and giving it a fresh coat of paint, without wrecking the foundation that made the game so great in the first place. In terms of combat, this is Demon's Souls as it has always been. New animations spice up the presentation, and add a lot of life to it's original counterpart. That being said, everything about the presentation just feels a bit different. It's not so much that the game doesn't look and play like Demon's Souls, but there are very subtle atmospheric changes that might offend the most pure of purist. Don't let that deter you though. This is the best modern way to experience Demon's Souls, and it's a visually stunning return to Boletaria. Umbasa!"

713,DaemonXHUN,"Nov 13, 2020",8,"[A realistic review - A faithful remake, but a missed opportunity] Aside from the obvious graphical overhaul and some minor tweaks and additions (e.g. the enhanced character creator and the respec system), this remake is essentially identical to the 2009 original mechanics and content-wise. Therefore it's quite mind-boggling how it can have a higher critical score then the version that came 11 years prior to it. Demon's Souls is still a competent and quite enjoyable game, it's basically a rough blueprint / prototype for the other SoulsBorne games that followed it and it actually does some things better than the subsequent titles, like the boss fights that are actually unique and each have an interesting mechanics or idea tied to them and not all boss fights boil down to ""roll away from attacks than hit"". But it also shows its glaring problems and strange design choices with its age, especially in this more modern form. The Grass-based healing system is bad. It can either make the game needlessly easy to the point of zero challenge, or needlessly grindy - it should have been replaced with a system similar that is in the newer games (e.g. the Estus Flasks from Dark Souls). The World Tendency system should have also gotten a significant overhaul or even rework, because it simply doesn't offer enough choices and opportunities for the players' to reliably change Tendency levels (especially if they play offline) and because of that, they can miss out on a significant amount of content, especially if they are new, unexperienced players who are unfamiliar with this system. The high importance of the Luck stat here compared to its relatively minor importance in other SoulsBorne and Soulslike titles is also very problematic, especially because the game quite simply doesn't have enough content (areas, enemies etc.) in order to justify the existence of a stat like this and/or this stat to be able to work like it's intended. There are a lot of specific materials that can't be found through regular play and exploration so if you want to go for a certain build, chances are high you'll have to invest a significant amount of time to farm them instead of actually steadily progressing through the game. The last major problem with the game is that a significant amount of the areas simply aren't particularly interesting or fun. Of course, nearly all (if not all) Souls titles have problems with some of their areas (like Blighttown and Demon Ruins in Dark Souls, or Forbidden Woods and Nightmare of Mensis in Bloodborne), but Demon's Souls is full of underdeveloped, way too narrow and repetitive, or simply uninterestingly designed areas like these. I'd still recommend the game though. It's a Souls-like so you know what you'll get. Tight controls, possibly challenging gameplay, cryptic storytelling and worldbuilding, rewarding exploration etc. And as a remake, this game is basically perfect. I just wish that the developers at Bluepoint Games would have done more with it. I wish they would have fixed the game's main problems and perhaps create a new area for the 6th archstone. To me, this game is a solid 7 out of 10, because I have played this before multiple times and I do not consider the remake as a huge improvement, but for new players, I can see how it can be a better experience, hence why my final rating is an 8 out of 10."

716,HitIerDidNuffin,"Nov 13, 2020",6,"Is this game bad? Certainly not. Is this a faithful remake of Demon's Souls? ABSOLUTELY NOT.I went in expecting Demon's Souls and what I got was a mix of Nioh and a generic Souls style game. The art style is far from the original and it shows that the people in charge did not understand the art style of the game and much less the idea behind the characters. Rather than remaking Demon's Souls I feel like Bluepoint attempted to push this to a more casual audience mixed with newer Dark Souls fans rather than remaking what is still an amazing piece.Fun game, however I would never call this a faithful remake."

722,Abovewater,"Nov 13, 2020",9,"Among a sea of fanboys on both sides, this review is the safe haven you are looking for. So hello my friend, stay awhile and listen. Scrolling through the abyss of reviews on here, my eyes were being assaulted by demons. I looked to the left and see ""SoNy SuCks, 0 out of 10"" I then looked to my right and saw ""SoNy iS ThE BeSt 10 out of 10"". It was at this moment I realized I must undertake a quest and purge the Metacritic of these Demons. I see the Old one, the greatest demon of all, his fog has now reached the gates of our real world and is affecting poor souls in this world. Remember, a hunter is a hunter, even in a dream. Let us purge the dross away and begin with The Good. Visuals. Demon's Souls for PS5 is an absolute visual feast. The attention to detail is simply breathtaking. Every brick has character and life in it. The fire affects are the most realistic fire effects I have ever seen in a game. The actual character models look like real people and not horrid creatures. One example of great detail is dragon fire breath hitting a wall and starting a banner on fire, and you can watch the banner slowly burning away on the wall until it disappears. And that's just in the background, it wasn't pointed out to the player specifically by the game. It is something a lot of people could miss, but they put that kind of detail and effort into it anyway. The environments look stunning and make you believe this place really exists and truly pulls you into the world. The sounds, especially the 3d audio are just as good, if not better than the visuals. The sound effects are absolutely amazing. You can hear the bone crunching on deep hits such as backstabs and ripostes. The audio sounds very crisp and clean. Audio really hasn't sounded next gen until now, just a layer of depth that brings everything to life. The controls. The haptic feedback and rumble are great features. Every hit you can feel. But it's the depth of it that is amazing. Hitting a wall with your sword feels a lot more different than hitting metal armor, which again feels different from hitting flesh. You can even feel it when you are running on sand, the controller rumble gives a subtle feeling of running on sand (hard to believe and describe but its there). When enemies are about to throw fire at you, you can feel the rumbling of fire permeating through the controller. Actual controls are very responsive and intuitive as well. Performance. Playing this game in performance mode is silky smooth. This game runs at a locked 60 fps, with only very tiny occasional drops to the framerate which rarely ever happen and aren't very noticeable. This game feels like playing butter, if butter was a game in which one could experience. But very smooth gameplay and responsive gameplay. Okay now on to the bad. There are a couple things in which I want to address. I personally do not like how some of the menus, text and hud look. It's a personal opinion but I feel it is very generic and doesn't have much ""soul"". It especially stands out cause the rest of the game looks phenomenal. Some of the voice acting is a little bland. Especially compared to the original. Even when some of the original people were brought back to voice act, some of the iconic lines don't have the same feeling to them anymore. The other thing I want to address is having exclusive content locked behind buying a pre-ordered deluxe addition. One of the weapons especially received is extremely OP with almost no stat requirements and does a lot of damage and has crazy reach. I feel this is wrong to do to players and consumers. Other than those things, this game is truly an amazing game. Whether you are new to souls games, a veteran of souls but new to Demon's Souls, or an OG Demon's Souls player, this game is truly an amazing game and worth playing. If you are new to Souls, this game will be a challenge, just a warning. So that's it, I know this review is longer than 2 sentences like 95% of the reviews here. But if you are reading this, it means you have a brain and are choosing to read something a little different. Thank you for reading. Remember that you have a heart of gold, don't let them take it from you. Praise the Sun and Umbassa."

725,Ight,"Nov 18, 2020",7,"The game is very enjoyable, and gorgeous but my score is due to type of games on the launch of the ps5, I already played the original in the ps3 days so this game felt very much like the same except for the graphics and details on enemy design. it didn't really feel like a new game, and more of nostalgia effect. It feels like a cash grab"

729,GamerRN,"Nov 19, 2020",9,"I’ve platinum Bloodborne & DLC packs, Dark Souls, Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, Dark Souls III & DLC packs, Demon’s Souls (PS3) and Ive also 1,000 Gamer Score the games on Xbox One X, sans Demon’s Souls & Bloodborne as they are Playstation Exclusives. I can only comment on PvE, I have no interest in PvP. Demon’s Souls PS5 is as close to a perfect as one can get. Immediate load times, a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack, and is true to original craftsmanship. I wouldn’t give any game a 10/10, seriously nothing is perfect. But this is Grade A quality. A few points of constructive criticism: there are no longer male/female bodies, they are Type A, Type B. Which can be a bit confusing. Also, in 5-2, the merchant woman has a change in dialogue removing “Virgin Mary” originally in PS3, however not here on PS5. Interestingly enough, there is an added secret room to find in Boletaria, which Bluepoint have hidden away for discovery. Two final notes of constructive criticism: to delete a save file is VERY confusing. Also, it should not be a trend to pay $70.00 for next gen games. There are innumerable articles with evidence provided which debunk the cost of games are up argument. So in all, VERY enjoyable, a treat for the eyes, A must play."

The new animations they've added for backstabs, ripostes, and the new addition of 2 hand backstabs make it so that I want to test out every new weapon I find. This game is a visual masterpiece, and since they kept the bones of the original demon's Souls, you know that the gameplay is a masterclass as well. If your patient and have your wits about you, you can beat this game. Don't be discouraged!"

738,SupremeOSU,"Nov 26, 2020",10,Faithful and truly an amazing piece of art.I am so impressed that bluepoint made the perfect remake
739,fewcus,"Nov 29, 2020",6,"Whilst the gameplay and mechanics of Demon's Souls have been almost entirely left untouched (for better or worse), I cannot help but feel that the game's atmosphere, which drew me into the original and made it one of my all time favourites, has been left by the wayside. On a technical level the game is quite impressive, of course, but many of the changes to the art direction (in particular enemy, character and boss design) feel like changes which at best merely misunderstood the appeal of the original, and at worst are just plain bad. Overall, though, the visual changes can be said to be a mixed bag. The worst offender, one that is sometimes insultingly bad, are the changes made to the game's sound design and OST. The changes are sweeping, with a large number of music tracks being largely unrecognisable, misunderstanding the tone and mood the original was trying to set, and overall having an overreliance of 'epic' orchestral arranges with booming choirs that often makes each track hard to differentiate from one another. Generally, I would steer you to try out the original if you have the means to do so before you opt to play this version."
740,ChupaThangE,"Nov 28, 2020",9,"Demon's Souls (2020) is everything and more than what it needed to be from a Remake. With some new balances including a change to how the item system works, Bluepoint has added and subtracted where it matters to create a wonderful and balanced game. The only feature I couldn't believe wasn't in the game was the ability to delete character saves that you don't want. If you want to save room and clear out test characters you have to delete your entire storage. There is no easy mode, but a reminder that PVP is BUILT into the entire game. An easy mode would give people an unfair advantage...and it's addition would ruin the experience."

747,UT99,"Nov 26, 2020",10,"Demon's Souls remake is jaw dropping and more than lives up to the hype. The attention to detail in this game is mind blowing for a launch title. My only problem is some of the voice acting was more memorable in the original PS3 version. Freke's Apprentice is forgettable in this version and some the voice acting is surprisingly dour. Maiden in Blacks voice acting has thankfully been fixed but a lot of the voice acting can be a bit of a hit or miss depending on which version of Demon's Souls you prefer, Overall Demon's Souls Remake is a stunning game that you can play for hundreds of hours but it may not be everyone's cup of tea."

The bosses are all extremely simple and easy, and often boring because of it. Some of the areas in this game are obnoxious as well imo. I think they improved a lot after Demons Souls. This game is still great, but one of the worst in the Dark Souls and Bloodborne/Sekiro series."

I haven't finished the game yet, but 2 of 4 bosses were killed with 1st try. I'm not a DS genre veteran, furthermore bloodborne is the only game I played, nevertheless in my opinion bloodborne is harder than this game. Maybe, this is good: you still have a satisfaction after overcoming another boss, but you needn't to spend a week to pass it"

768,raihidara,"Dec 26, 2020",7,"The biggest issue with Demon's Souls is not that it is hard, but that it fully disrespects the player. One could reasonably practice against any enemy and easily defeat them given enough time, but the issue is that you run into a new enemy or trap and suddenly die, losing 30 minutes to an hour of progress each time. This game is a prime example of the old school mantra that wasted time = difficulty that most modern games have fortunately done away with. Top the wasted time off with a system that punishes your losses further and it's nothing but an exercise in masochism. The remake looks and sounds fantastic though."
769,paulrage,"Jan 12, 2021",10,"A great game where all begins. Demon's Souls on PS5 is the biggest launch tittle. The game loads really fast, has pretty graphics, is so fun com co-op and even offline. The game is so good that i already have more than 150 hours."

773,Dem0nK,"Apr  3, 2021",4,"Its not a remake, its a remaster. Bluepoint doesn't know what is game design and can't do anything good. 10 years old gameplay is stupid, resources farm is boring, and developers made it even worse when made weight for herbs etc. Only good point in this remaster is graphics and sound"
774,aydinnesty,"May  4, 2021",0,Almost no effort has been made for gameplay. It's nothing more than a simple remake.
775,Witchywoman212,"Nov 29, 2020",6,"As much as I would love to give this game a 100 rating (I love Souls games) I really can't.  I played on the PS3, and it was a drudge to get through.  But, I have platinumed every soulsborne game, and wanted to platinum this game as well.  i played it on PS3 too late to go platinum.  First the game has beautiful graphics, beautiful sound track, and is a forerunner to the later souls games.  From Software realized there were many flaws in this game that needed to be done away with to make the future souls games more enjoyable to the player.  I am glad they did this, because i would never attempt to play a game this brutal if they hadn't.  They realized the 2009 version had too many flaws, which made it a brutal game, and not much fun. I wish they had done away with the world tendency.  This makes the game difficult, and discourages co-op.  You have to go through the game with half your health, and if you pick someone up to help you with a boss fight, and you die woe to you.  Your world changes from white (much easier to get through areas, or black impossible to get through areas)  Souls is all about co-op, and invasions.  This is actually discouraged in this game.  Who would put down their red sigh, fight pvp, or lose, and have it ruin your game.  But that can happen.  I pick up a phantom in the 3rd area, we both died, when I came back into the area my world had turned dark.  One death and I was dark.  I did everything possible to get back my white tendency.  I killed all 3 bosses and the primeval devil, and my tendency did not budge.  I know this was a glitch.  i have written Blue Point about this.  In area 4, one death in corporal form, my tendency went from pure white to pure black.  Another glitch.  I couldn't get through the area because when the world is black, you have a difficult game.  Virtually impossible to get through, with all the black phantoms.  They guard the boss doors, and it can take hours to complete the area.  There is very little help from co-op becomes no one wants to go into corporal form to pick up phantoms.  Primeval demons can help turn your world back to white, but half of them don't show up where they should be.  The one in Stone Fang Tunnel is not in my world.  You are really screwed, if you can't get back to neutral tendency .  Might as well start another character and hope the glitches are fixed with a patch.  I feel for the people who want to invade.  There are so few people playing in corporal form  That can't be much fun for the invaders.  Blue Point had a chance to make this a better game, and blew that off.  I don't think I will play another Blue Point game if they slavishly recreate a game, don't take out the glitches, and make the game a little bit more fun.  What is the harm.  It is their game now.  From did away with the worst of the Demons Souls, and went on to make games more fun for the players.  Yes, they are hard, but sooo much fun. This game is not for casual players, and make sure you have your computer on your lap at all times so you won't screw up.  This game punishes every little mistake.  The game costs $70, and frankly that is too expensive, when the glitches were inherited and never fixed.  I would recommend you play a game where the developer actually wants you to enjoy your investment.  I think Ubisoft likes for the player to have fun, and their new assassins games are fun.  i will never buy another game from a company that makes the game miserable for the player.  Looking forward to Eldon Ring.  Hope it turns out better."

780,MedusaMadman77,"Dec  5, 2020",4,"Now that I've spent some time with it, I can truly say that this is a bad game. Dull and disrespectful of your time. It's only hard in that the controls were designed by a fool. It's like driving with your feet, and once your get the hang of that, it's the same boring grind over and over. Worst launch game I've bought since Orphen on PS2.. At least I can get some money for the trade in."

782,troybilts,"Jan  5, 2021",4,"I think you need to have some nostalgia to like this game.  Coming into it never having played a Souls game it really was not very fun.  Seems to be a giant grind fest.  By the time you get anything good the game is over.    So to use any of your powers/weapons etc, you just have to play it all over again. ugh....  Killing the dragons was laughably terrible, there were just giant fire breathing enemies that repeated their path like a scratched and skipping record. No skill or tactics needed, just fire-rinse-repeat.   Graphics were great though."
783,Rangertwin1208,"Nov 27, 2020",8,"As someone who loved Demon's Souls, the game is great, no doubt, and it's definitely a good entry for newcomers, especially with its quality of life additions. My main issues with the game however are, of course, some of the changes. New designs like the fat official definitely aren't as good, and some of the boss themes try too hard to be bombastic (Old Monk and Dirty Colossus for example). Also, don't expect any improvement in the Ai, since it's the same how it was in the original."
784,Maugaran,"Apr 19, 2021",7,Game is ok but not brilliant. +Grafik +Level +Combat System -Small Level Size -no Roleplay
785,ERRORCODE-20,"Nov 28, 2020",8,"As is the case with many remakes you get a bunch of dense, pretentious, fanboy purists that cant except change.  Even when they are truly minor at best. Nitpicking flaws that really arent there, while ignoring all the obvious and objective ways the remake improves on the original. Lets get this out the way. This remake, by all objective metrics, is better than the original. Instant load times that remove tedium, more unique animations, locked 60 fps at all times, items get sent straight to Thomas whenever you reach max load, etc etc etc. To address more subjective aspects such as overall art direction. The original had its charm and that's what made it great. The remake doesnt quite capture the orignal but it comes as close as you could really get while also being different and giving the original a new spin. Which is what remakes are supposed to do. A lot of what people dont realize is that. By updating the games graphics, the game would inherently have a different atmosphere. Now whether the atmosphere is worse is up to you. Also, I swear these people that are complaining haven't even bothered to use the classic filter. Which really does help at giving it that same feel from back in 2009. Is it going to be perfect? No, but it definitely helps. What really bothers me though is when these purists try to nitpick individual character designs and act as if it takes away much from the game. I'm sorry but just because Adjudicator has nipples now doesn't give the game a different atmosphere. Like at all. Yeah some designs may not be to your tastes, such as the fat officials (I very much prefer the original) but had these designs been in the original, it wouldn't have made a difference on the overall tone or atmosphere of the game. At least to not any considerable degree. And most changes to the environments, would've greatly benefitted the original had they been there. Boletaria is actually shrouded in fog now, Shrine of Storms takes place in a much heavier storm with heavy rain cascading throughout the entire level, Vanguard, while yes a big departure from the originals design, is far more intimidating and really strengthens Shrine of Storms intense and brutal atmosphere far more than his much more goofy look in the original. Latria's Mind Frayers are similarly more intimidating, and the increased level geometry coupled with the gothic architecture and lightning strikes just fit so perfectly with Latria's overall dark and claustrophobic qualities from the original. Its truly brilliant. All these aspects that I just mentioned would've greatly enhanced the originals overall appeal. Certainly far more than a few supposedly weaker character and enemy designs would have detracted from it. Now on to the music. This is another aspect that purists love to harp on. And ill admit. The music 100% does not give off that same old-timey undertone the original had at all. Which is why it's so disappointing to see these ""fans"" harp on minor visual changes more than the actually different soundtrack. With that being said. Is the soundtrack worse? No, not really. Many songs are definite departures from the original and lend to a different feel yes. But I wouldn't say its worse. Just puts boss fights in a slightly different lens.. Some songs I prefer in the original such as Phalanx and Maiden in Black, but others I prefer in the remake such as Maiden Astreas, Flamelurker's and the Armored Spider. I do wish they did give the option to use the originals OST or even mix them around. Like putting the original flamelurkers theme but keeping the new Tower Knights. That could've been interesting. All this is to say that this remake is actually amazing as far as remakes go. Its still for better and worse, the same exact game from 11 years ago as far as gameplay is concerned. Which imo means its still not better than Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne, or DS3 but still a great game. Which is why its an 8 for me."

790,DJKrimson,"Dec 25, 2020",7,Absolutely fantastic graphics and fun gameplay. Love the darksouls-like games but contentwise this is probably the worst one. The levels and the bosses can't match the ones in the other games. Still I had a really good time playing for around 60 hours until I got my platinum trophy. Rating it for the game and not for the remake.
791,mxnu54,"Feb 26, 2021",0,"Very bad gameplay, completely bugged. Not hard like in Sekiro, just bad. Never worth more then 30bucks."
792,dangyosabyss,"Mar 25, 2021",5,Its a 5/10. A ps5 game shouldnt control like this even if it is meant to be a 'faithful remake' (it isnt). The content is too light and there needed to be more items/armour/weapons (and I dont mean level locked special edition weapons that are useless as soon as you leave 1-1). The game visually is stunning (as it should be) bar the facial expressions of the characters. These are not good. Ps2 tier. Theyre not grotesque in the endearing way like in other Soulsborne games. They are just bad. Mass Effect Andromeda bad. And to address the elephant in the room and trigger hatemail - this is what happens when you let a non-japanese team make a souls game. American politics from the get go mar this game. The rubix cube characterisation is idiotic and is not needed in a japanese game made originally by japanese people. It only serves to show why so many people adopt a 'japanese games only' approach - theyre tired of propaganda in video games. There was none of this in any of the From Games prior. Consider it testament to how politics in the west ruin everything in gaming. I have a feeling that in the years to come we will look back on this game in embarrassment as blind pandering led to more offensive portrayals than it might ever have destroyed. I will say 'Satsuki' and move on. The control scheme doesnt make the most of the ps5's raw power. It still feels 'choppy'. Memes and player message palettes bordering on walkthroughs also have no place in Souls games. Souls games became popular because they were always themselves. They taught you rather than pandered to you. Reducing them to dated meme machines does them a huge disservice. We dont need pop anime or Simpsons references in games because all they do is lower the games content to the value of clickbait list fodder. tldr : DS got a AAA makeover making it pretty but in return was made every bit as vapid as that classification suggests by the western stupidity injected into it.

Это всё меняет ;-)) Только не забудьте лупу прихватить!При этом сама игра хороша, но это точно не заслуга консолей нового поколения и прекрасно бы себя чувствовала на PC4. Жду настоящего некстгена!Хочу добавить, что PS5 у меня пока нет. Смотрел часть прохождения на YouTube в 4к с HDR. Очень не думаю, что в реальности картинка будет намного лучше, жизненный опыт подсказывает. Но вот на корявость анимаций боёв и тем паче добиваний никакой YоuTube повлиять не мог. Странно это видеть в ""некстгене""!Оценил именно как некстген, а не саму игру!"

As well as from cool bosses, almost every one of which I remember well. A great start to the nextgen era. Bluepoint & FromSoftware respect"
798,PadFou,"Jan 13, 2021",3,"The game is good. The price is not. 80€ (price in France, that's 97,50$) for a remake of an 11 years old game that mostly only get graphics ameliorations, that's completly overpriced. Definitly not worth it. Wait for a lower price or play the original game (which stay beautiful)."
799,Thejodjeremie,"Nov 17, 2020",8,"The game is a great remake when it comes to graphics, gameplay, music, voice acting and more. I really enjoyed it despite it being very challenging and frustrating at times. I have played all of the souls games and this is just as good as them."
800,Youngproscia,"Apr  2, 2021",1,"You are new to this game. You choose a strong opening character. 5 minutes into the game half your health is taken away permanently. You start the next level . You are doing well and progressing through the level. Something happens where you misstep a bit and you die. Guess what? You are sent back to the very beginning of the level, to go through the same areas and enemies again. You make it further this time but three enemies overwhelm you. You die. Guess what ? Right back to the beginning.Wheeeee thus is so much fun!! Not so much a game as an excercise in anger and wasting your time.The 1 is for the graphics. Completely overrated. You have been warned...."
801,Game_Critical,"Nov 23, 2020",5,"Demon's Souls is a remake of the classic PS3 game from 2009 made by Bluepoint, not From Software.This game is a mixed bag, the graphics are of course great. The use of light and dark gives a good and creepy atmosphere. However they took some liberties and some area's look quite different from the original which is a minus. The game runs smooth on performance mode, however it's too bad they somehow can't make it work with the best graphics. The difference isn't that great so i'd recommend to keep it on performance mode. The game plays nice, the combat feels impactful and the different classes are fun to play.This comes with a big downside: The AI. Demon's Souls is a remake of the original in every sense of the word, which means that the janky AI and unrewarding PvP is still part of the game.AI glitches from the original still work and the enemies still get stuck everywhere because of the bad pathing which really throws you off. PvP is still as janky as the original, it rewards exploiting lag and bad mechanics and punishes skillful play. Hardcore souls fans will be fine and they'll enjoy it, but for me it was disappointing. This was the perfect chance to elevate the game to a higher level, but Bluepoint/From completely missed this chance."
802,Naveless,"Dec 23, 2020",6,"Excellent remastered, but that's not a remake. That game has the same problems, as original game."
803,xiaoemo231,"Mar  9, 2021",2,Remake and Outsourced works but expensive.The heroine will not respond to the player's actions.Custom faces not enough.
804,martinho_99,"Mar 20, 2021",9,"Some people here are saying they ""don't think the game improved"", ""the boss re-designs are looking worse than the original"" and ""the changes don't justify this remake"". I can't believe they played this game the worlds look stunning! All the detail they added, just compare it side to side to the original. Every boss now looks like a real terrifying monster not just like a blurred stain, actually I think even the boss design of false King Allant improved (the more non demonic, pure design matches his idealised view of himself better - the true King is as ""ugly"" as ever). The only thing that could be better is the voice of the true king, in the original game it sounded more like the rotten demon he is than just an old man like in the remake. Don't complain about the gameplay, the AI is the absolute same why should it play different then? I feel Bluepoint put a lot of love and effort in this to make it a visual and proper PS5 masterpiece."
805,ArthurMorgan22,"Jan 26, 2021",0,This game is truly a masterpiece. I have never played the original or any souls game but I am in love with this game. The soundtrack is amazing and the combat is really satisfying. This is the best PlayStation game of 2020.
806,Papas_Fritas,"Aug 17, 2021",9,Probably the easiest Souls-Bourne game. Graphically it's an absolute masterpiece and if you want to get your feet wet in this series this is best place to start in my opinion.
807,Simpson_761,"Jan 31, 2021",10,This game is mainly for returning Souls fans or others who desire a challenge. You will most likely struggle with this game if you do not put time and effort into it. But for me its amazing to see where it was originally to how amazing Bluepoint have made it look!!! Stunning.
808,SSoulSlayer,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"I played on PS3 and now on PS5, so much fun.  I think the bosses are not as hard as Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne, butgetting there can be very difficult and rewarding.  The game us beautiful and works beautifully.  If you are now to Souls games my advise is Dying is ok its part of the game, dont expect to live through your first time through a level.  Rank up if you need. .Love tge grind, try new ways of fighting.  Have fun, get frustrated? Play something else for a bit and go back, dont give up!"
809,Brimac,"Nov 25, 2020",5,Absolutely Phenomenal remake of the original. Having a blast replaying this in all of it’s modern day Next Gen glory.  Sony definitely needs to add Bluepoint to their team.

Graphics are good, controls are okay, not 100% though, sometime you seem to miss an enemy when they are higher than you for example. Also what's with having to focus on every enemy, that seems so outdated. Not worth £70, such a shame they are trying to rip people off, most AAA are £50 and they've taken years to write stories and come up with concepts, this is just a remake, what a rip off. I bought on ebay for much less and will be selling it soon. Game concepts are not explained at all, e.g. Difficulty, tendency, durability. It's really not fun when a game gets harder when you die because of either tendency or durability of weapons. No fun at all sorry. Avoid!"

This is hugely frustrating to the point where after spending an entire day being killed at the same point I gave up on the game and will be trading it in.  no difficulty settings either.  hugely disappointing I could get past this point and see the rest of the game."
816,PS_GAMER24,"Jan  2, 2021",0,"This was my first game in the souls series (never played Bloodbourne either) and I couldn't put the controller down. This game is GOOD. The attention to detail is on parr with Hideo Kojima games, the graphics are amazing (best looking game I have ever played), and the world they have created is consuming (in a good way). One of the most memorable experiences I've had gaming."
817,BryLo420,"Jan  3, 2021",3,Literally one of the worst games I’ve ever played. Boring and horrible combat. Graphics however are very beautiful. Graphics are probably the only thing I can say positive about this game. Never felt so robbed of $70. Do yourself a favor and stay away

Just cause some game is hard, doesn't automatically mean that it's interesting or fun. Seems like these games are just made for people who like to kill same boss 100 times and just compete with others (like who kills this or that boss faster). To me that's like most boring way to play video games. If all video games were like that, i would have some different hobby or i would invent actually good video games. Either way, i didn't like Demon's Souls. It's just boss after boss and that's it. That's the game. To me, video game needs to have way, way more depth and details to justify price like this. I have yet to try ""Bloodborne"" because i have read that many people who hate souls games, actually like ""Bloodborne"". So maybe ""Bloodborne"" has more depth and more interesting level design, hopefully."

For example, there are no difficulty levels that you can set or change. I would say that you should think very carefully about buying this game. It requires a lot of training. I can't say much about the remake, as I haven't played the original, but I know that developer Bluepoint has done a very good job in the past, and I expect the same in this case. 5/10 because I see just too little warning for beginners, but also a very good game for experienced players familiar with the game."

830,Hiyaky,"Mar 30, 2021",3,"The game exists simply to lead you to enemies, with shallow content and mechanics, there is nothing great in this game. Being unnecessary hard, Demon’s Souls have nothing to motivate you to continue fighting against whoever wants to kill you. You usually know you will die in any game, so it is necessary to create reasons to keep you playing it. In this game, it’s much easier to die, and no actual cause to make you continue, not even the combats are worth it.Another thing are the points your character have, with many, many options that don’t really change anything in your gameplay, only making the game more complicated.And, well, it is horrible to die for a boss and having to walk thorough kilometers and fight so many enemies just to fight the boss again, which turns out to desmotivate the player to even try again.If the game were updated with a new system of checkpoints, and try to make some narrative, it would value something, but the actual price is crazy. If you really want to play it, wait to buy it."

834,Acrobat,"Aug  9, 2021",10,"10/10. I played some of the demon souls games including remastered one, and they seemed clunky with poor graphics. This game on the other hand was stunning. It's only good game on ps5 that is new, and I'd say it's a must buy. I'd compare to to BOTW or HZD games with its openness. The final battles were also very well done. I'd say its weakness if maybe in the multi player given there is no voice coms etc. However, they kept it in it's original form from 2010 or whenever the original game came out so I guess that is to be expected.All round it was fantastic"
835,spyrospy,"Aug 16, 2021",9,"A great way to start of the new generation! A remake of the first Fromsoft Souls game, Demon's Souls delivers everything I love of the series, while showcasing what PS5 is capable of. It does suffer from being the first game in the series, but it is still an amazing experience."
836,Kvro,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Demon's Souls is where a genre defining experience started, the remake takes the exact same game but with godly graphics. It's a unique experience for fans and new comers."
837,agg02_,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"This was my first ever souls-like game and I simply cannot express how honoured and lucky I feel after playing this masterpiece. If I were to dig deep inside of it I still would not find any major mistake enough to not play it. Yes, it is hard and yes you will hate it sometimes. But giving it another opportunity, and another one and another one is the magic of it as a whole. Of course you will die and you will question yourself what was going on in the devs' minds when creating a certain enemy or zone or boss. But when you find yourself capable of eventually moving and feeling like a master... That feeling is priceless."
838,doodlerman,"Sep 27, 2021",9,"With all the customization available to players, you'd think there'd be an option to use the original soundtrack. Above anything else (including the enemy redesigns), that is my biggest gripe. The new compositions lack the charm of the original tracks. The Prison of Hope's new atmospheric soundscape isn't as haunting as it once was either, but I dig the soundscapes of the other areas. The enemy redesigns are hit and miss. Some of them aren't very noticeable (like the dragons, dreglings, blue/red eye knights, the Penetrator, etc), but others are downright outrageous (the iconic Fat Officials, in particular). But, beneath all the fresh paint, it's still Demon's Souls. And Demon's Souls is great. Is it $70 great? Not really. It's a game that's over a decade old and there aren't many additional bells and whistles added to the remake's gameplay, other than a few quality-of-life improvements. In some respects, it's faithful to a fault but somehow different enough to throw you off your muscle memory from the original. Despite all these conflicting feelings, I still think the Demon's Souls remake is great. I also think the original should be re-released so that this doesn't erase it."
839,keredd1010,"Sep  6, 2021",8,"Let's just get the obvious out of the way. The game looks, well, wow. Absolutely fantastic. One thing that can be said about From Software is that they are NOT known for their graphics. They usually forego facial animations altogether and Bluepoint really embarrassed them in this particular aspect of the game. So 10 out of 10 as far as graphical improvement and animation is concerned. One thing about this game that bugs me is that it feels incomplete. Some of the bosses are a joke and gimmicky. At times you face a boss directly after facing one making one think that there were supposed to be other section in between that never got developed. Even the sixth archstone feels like it should indeed be there. I think this may due to funding being cut as this was considered a failure when Miyazaki took it over. I suspect they were not willing to dump anymore money into it. Even the cut scene where the Monumental explains the archstones mentions the 6th one.  This leaves the game feeling half baked and the bosses are quite lacking. Even so, the game is quite a blast and very replayable as you can always try new builds with new weapons."
840,Sacred,"Jul 13, 2021",10,Просто идеальный ремейк !! Визуальное пиршество даже в режиме производительности. Да и сложность игры довольна снисходительная. Легкие боссы не мешают получать удовольствие от игры.
841,chr1so,"Oct  4, 2021",10,I'm a sucker for soulsborne games so was always going to love this one.If you've played dark souls you pretty much know what you're getting here.Looks pretty good on ps5

843,guiletheguiles,"Dec 16, 2020",8,"Bluepoint strikes again by transforming an already beloved game into something even more beloved! If you've played Demon's Souls back in the PS3, chances are that you'll feel, like me, right at home!Everything is here, just as it was back then. The creepy atmosphere, the experimental systems, the challenging tactical combat mechanics, the great soundtrack, the cryptic NPCs, tough bosses, the raw anger you'll feel after losing 40k souls to a stupid death... Everything! The difference is in the visuals, the performance and some very few quality of life improvements. Demon's Souls Remake is BEAUTIFUL! Probably the most visually detailed and stunning game I've ever seen. It even looks great on Performance Mode. **** even those unnecessary filters are pretty! Now combine this visual prowess with the bleak and difficult atmosphere of Demon's Souls, plus the insane redesigns from some creatures and NPCs, and you have yourself one of the most faithful remakes ever made. Maybe too faithful, actually!A few things could have changed, since remakes were supposed to improve on all things.For example, the world tendency system is still a confusing mess, checkpoints are still annoying as hell, item descriptions could've been improved to give us a bigger sense of the lore and, DAMN... I really wanted that sixth pillar to be an ACTUAL level in the game. They could've given us that, right?Well, you can't have everything in life... Demon's Souls Remake is the BEST way to play a very good/very old game. Probably the best thing to spend money on, if you own a PS5. You owe it to yourself.It's not Miyazaki's masterpiece, by any means. Far from it. But it's a hell of a good, weird and challenging ride."
844,binholeblon,"Jan 14, 2021",10,FIRST time on a Souls game and I n loving It.This game makes me feel alive
845,herrmoekl,"Aug 23, 2021",4,"I am a huge fan of Bloodborne and call it one of my favorite games of all time. Bloodborne was my introduction to From Software. After playing BB i played DS3 and then Sekiro. While Bloodborne was and forever will be my favorite of them i had a lot of appreciation for DS3 and Sekiro. Things i love about Bloodborne is it´s smart level Design, it´s extremely challenging but rewarding Gameplay and it´s horrifying beauty. All these 3 things are lacking in this Game. I probably am part of a minority with thinking that this Game didn´t age well. In my opinion there is two types of difficult Games: a good one and a bad one. While i would classify BB, DS3 and Sekiro entirely as the former here it´s too much of the latter. Tight hallways that take your view while having extremely aggressive enemies in the way not being able to really see yourself or them well. Unbalanced Boss fights put in weird spaces that don´t seem nearly as thought out as later entries in From Softwares catalogue. Then there is the Level Design. This is where Bloodborne shines and delivers again and again with it´s clever and rewarding distribution of Lamps (checkpoints), something almost entirely missing from this Game. Whereas in Bloodborne and Post-BB Games i felt rewarded after fighting through a tough area arriving at a checkpoint or discovering a new area here i never have those experiences. There is no feeling of joy after finishing a Boss after studying their attack patterns because most Bosses lack ambitious mechanics. Moreover the Mechanics of Bosses don´t really feel integrated into the Gameplay. Again, with all the Post-BB Souls Games there was a coherence between the Boss Design and Gameplay mechanics. Whenever i died in those Games to a Boss or enemies i always felt like i wasn´t good enough, thinking about the enemy attack patterns and how i could improve. When i die here i find myself most of the time thinking about poor design choices such as the things mentioned. Another example of it´s unbalanced mechanics is farming for healing items. While BB did have the need to find healing items as well the distribution was way more balanced out and enemies would frequently drop them. In certain areas of Demons Souls you wont find any healing items at all which adds to the overall feeling of frustration this Game leaves me with."
846,MickeyBrownEyes,"Feb 12, 2021",10,"Exquisite game, it masterfully preserves all the magic from the original and brings it to the next gen. What a lot of good memories, all remade and recrafted to bring us an unforgettable adventure again!"

848,johanBjorn,"Dec  2, 2020",7,"It's pretty, but you can feel its age as you play it. It's obvious that this was the first iteration in a really great franchise, because the core mechanics of the game feel much less polished. It's not a bad game by any means, it's just not particularly fun to me. It feels more like a grind than a joy to play."
849,ahmadhz1999,"Aug 22, 2021",8,"This is one of the best looking games that I have ever seen and you have the option to pick 60fps which is great. The gameplay is not the best but with the dual sense haptics the combat feels very real and satisfying. The music is not as good as other souls games but is good enough. The worst thing about this game is the enemy AI and this affects the difficulty a lot. Some bosses in the game are basically braindead and that makes it too easy to beat them. If this game is your first souls game then that is not a huge problem because the game might be already hard for you. However if you have played a souls game before, the AI will make the game too easy for you and that is not good. Overall even with the AI problems I highly recommend this game to people that like challenging games or other soul-type games."
850,Nimins,"Sep  7, 2021",10,Legendary game. Beautiful and filled with secrets och hidden paths. Great boss battles and nice level design. Many builds and lots of replayability. People rating this game less than 10/10 need to git gud.
851,Belafonte,"Apr  5, 2021",9,"I have to say that I am equaly amazed by the genius of the original game and by the deepest respect of this remake for the source material. Combats feel so good and the game is so beautiful. However, it is clear that the formula has been refined in the following Souls trilogy. veterants from Souls games might feel that bosses or some levels are a bit videogamey compared to the recent Fromsoftware games."
852,CrossXaberS,"Aug  7, 2021",9,I've already played the original and this faithful remake @ $70 is worth it for the fans of the franchise. This is not just a simple graphic upgrade. There are numerous change and tweak that actually improve the playing experience.PROS:- Load time is almost nonexistence. It really help get you right back in the game after a frustrating death/mistake- More streamlined inventory management where you can instantly send items back to Nexus so you don't have to be upset when you have to leave the loots there on the stage. You can even forge weapon using your materials/stones/ores directly from the Nexus. It's really convenient.- 8 directional rolling. + 100% freedom of movement compared to the original. Can't say no to that!- Performance mode @ 60fps is a game changer for many ppl saying 30fps is unplayable- Best nextgen graphic with the art style of soulborne games. *chef kiss- Freaking photo mode to really appreciate that godlike graphics and add your own unique touch.- New trophies list that is more fair than the original (RNG BS)- Penetrator armor challenge adds some new contents and reasons to push through CONS:- Artistic liberty taken with some character designs actually worse than the original (fat officials)- Miss the opportunity to finally realize the cut content of the 6th Archstone- Some contents locked behind paywall of the deluxe edition and pre-order bonus Overall:9/10

855,WorldRedbull,"Feb 27, 2021",8,"Demon's Souls is the first actual entry of the souls series, and this is it's remake. How is it? The Good:-The graphics are breathtaking. Easily the best looking game i've played in the past 5 years, it's very easy to get immersed in the levels, and notice tiny details that are really stellar.-The new animations, and haptic feedback serve the game incredibly well. They're easily the most refined in the souls series and with new facial animations it's set a new standard(At least in my opinion) for facial animations in Soulsborne games.-The standard PVE gameplay is amazing, going through each archstone world is a blast, and each area feels distinct and has a unique style to them. Combat itself is really good, it's your standard Souls game, tried and true with magic, dark magic, pyromancies(they're just lumped into magic but it counts), Faith, Strength, Dex. Your typical souls affair.-The story still holds up, it has its great moments like the final boss of the Valley of Defilement, the bridge to the Tower Knight, or many of the NPC's questlines.-A lot of quality of life improvements, World Tendency is easier to figure out, sending items to storage without having to go back to the nexus, reduced loading screens(they're like 5 seconds long at most).-Photo mode is pretty cool.-PVP can be really fun, A lot of weapons can be great in combat, but PVP does have its flaws.-Fractured mode is a fun mirror image of the game and can throw you for a loop if you're not careful. The Bad:-The weapon upgrading system is terrible. Some materials require literal grinding, others are incredibly expensive, and some almost don't show up at all. Getting your weapon maxed out is a pain, and you will want to jump off a cliff.-The PVP can be full of min maxing goons that are the most anti-fun people you will ever meet. There's no magic requirement for spells, so you can meet a level 4 mage that has a high level spell that one shots you, or heaven forbid someone brings the Dragon Bone Smasher early on against you.-Some of the bosses are pretty mediocre or just plain bad. Dragon God is terrible, the adjudicator is still really easy, and the dirty colossus boss is....a thing.-The hitboxes of certain objects or weapons can be incredibly janky. The boulders of Stonefang Valley are a good example. Overall despite these flaws, Demon's Souls Remake is still the classic game from 2009. It was a helluva good time, and is one of my top SoulsBorne games. I prefer Dark Souls 1 honestly myself(Second Favorite), but Demon's Souls  definitely would be third."

Bosses wil 1 hit kill you in new game plus. I like a challenge but to many aspects are broken in this game. parry is incosistent so i cant use that anymore. Lot of backstaps miss. I can go on and on its a decent game but the mechanics are a nightmare. Making this game way harder then it actually is.

Creo que todos alguna vez en nuestra vida tenemos que probar algún juego de este estilo, y creo que este Demon Soul es prefecto para iniciarte en el mundo Soul"
872,SplitMind,"Jul  4, 2021",7,"After DS3 I'd taken a break from Souls games for the sake of my sanity, but having got a PS5 my options for games were very limited and my curiosity got the better of me, so here I am feeling like I've been through the Souls wringer one more time. The graphics of Demon's Souls are actually a mixed bag for me. What you see is very well-crafted, however the biggest drawback is the level design and the dark and dankness of pretty much every level. When you get to more colourful and vibrant environments the game shines, however many levels such as the prison, swamp and tunnel were just so dark and dingy that I feel they really missed an opportunity to show off what the PS5 can do. I think this is a result of staying faithful to the original a bit too much, which is a recurring problem in Demon's Souls. The gameplay of DS has rarely been better than it is here. Anyone having played any DS game will feel at home. The backstabs, rolls and challenging gameplay are here in spades and typical Souls-fashion. For the most part this is excellent and they aren't changing what doesn't need to be changed. Yet there are some baffling design choices that should have changed. The game basically has an extra layer of difficulty that arises from bad design to me. A lack of bonfires means a long journey to get to most bosses if you die. Think Bed of Chaos only not so maddening, There are shortcuts but these aren't at all short at times. The level design leaves much to be desired. You have 4 levels split into roughly 4 sections, however each one is quite one-dimensional and some of the labyrinthian elements are downright frustrating and unbalanced, such as the prison and swamp. This detracted from my enjoyment noticeably and again seems the result of remaking rather than reworking the original. If there was one game mechanic I would have changed it would be health being cut in half when in Phantom form. This is bewildering design choice, making for punishing rather than challenging gameplay. Add to this the unnecessary world tendency mechanic and I was not impressed at having to spend 90% of the game at 50% of health. This is something sequels rectified and the remake should have also. Finally for gameplay, we have the boss fights. I'm actually torn on whether this is a good or bad thing, but most of the bosses resemble puzzles rather than fights. This means no matter how skilled you are you are not going to win unless you figure out the mechanic or look it up online as I had to do a good few times. I think only the Dragon God boss really irks me and anyone who has played the game will know why - it's just bad and banal game design. Having said that, the diversity of bosses is very good and few were outright unbalanced. Lastly, the story. As typical for souls games, the story here is minimal at the surface level but you can delve further into the lore if you like. This is something I've always applauded Souls games for, however at the beginning of Demon's Souls we do get a fairly hefty story introduction and I am happy to see that too. Overall, Demon's Souls is faithful to the original, for the worse in my opinion. However, this is still a pretty good Souls game and it actually makes me appreciate Dark Souls all the more. I am glad Demon's Souls was not my first Souls game as I can really feel the 'prototype' nature of it in comparison to Dark Souls. It's a bit of an indictment on modern gaming that a remake of a PS3 game is the USP of the PS5, but at least it's actually a good game and not riddled with live services and microtansactions."
873,Jaimeastur,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"BUENÍSIMO! Me ha tenido súper atrapado de principio a fin, una obra maestra"
874,Rezoman,"Feb 10, 2021",9,Fantastic remaster! Honestly I was happy to know that a different studio would be working on it since the dark souls remaster was literally just a frame rate boost. People who are saying that the dark atmosphere is gone are just a bunch of babies who are hating on the game cause it still has a dark atmosphere.
875,Christo1,"Aug  3, 2021",10,"It took me some time to truly appreciate the difficulty of this game a d it’s mastery level, but once you do that you see what a true gem Demon’s Souls really is.  This is one hundred percent a masterpiece and I hope they make a new installment in this series on the Ps5 again soon!!!"
876,BrightAbyss,"Dec 30, 2020",9,"Demon's Souls is a great game, but it isn't for everybody. Like all From Software products, the game is challenging. Players could spend many hours on just one boss and that can be very frustrating to some. Despite this, I can promise you that when you do eventually beat the boss, it will be extremely rewarding. If you are more of a casual gamer not looking for a challenge, then this may be a game to pass on. If you are a competitive gamer who has never played the original, then you will absolutely love this game. Now if you have played the original or are a From Software game veteran, the gameplay is almost identical to the original. This means that yes the AI isn't the smartest, your character doesn't move like a more modern game, and places to reset the world are much farther apart. This is the main reason why there are a few people that gave this game a low score on this site. The company stayed true to the original game, only making it look and run better, and that's all I wanted in it. That's why I enjoyed it so much, but some people will disagree. At the end of the day, it's a great game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a challenging, gorgeous, and satisfying PS5 game."

886,iMustang,"Jun  7, 2021",9,"I loved this game much more than I ever thought I would have, in no short part from how beautiful the PS5 remake was to experience with stunning visuals, fantastic music, and a fantastic experience with the dualsense controller. Yes it was brutal, yes I died a lot, but I became inspired to do better with each failure I had which made my victories all the sweeter. Maybe it's because I was conditioned by the initial difficulty and the lack of checkpoints, but I always seemed to feel rewarded when the game would give me something to make things easier or I found a way to get more souls. That feeling of trial and error, risk and reward, and frustration to triumph made the game unique and fun to play, almost like a hard mode for Legend of Zelda. I do wish the story was a little more transparent, and I do still want to watch a deep dive video to the lore to appreciate it more, but I wish it could have been experienced to a higher degree in game. Still, that's a very minor complaint as the story is fairly straightforward to begin with. I always thought these sorts of games could never be for me, but I definitely found something special in Demon's Souls, and I may just have to hunt for the Platinum in this little gem."
887,Daniel0809,"Jan  9, 2021",5,"Only thing that makes these games hard is no check points, thats it. Its not a difficult game but its very time consuming because they make it hard by starting all over when you die. Great graphics though"
888,DoctorCocToPuss,"Dec  3, 2020",7,"I'll start off by saying that I don't believe this game is the system seller it's been propped up by games media to be. It is an extremely faithful remake, all things considered, that's focus is entirely on preserving the feel and gameplay of the original. This was a difficult coin to toss for Bluepoint as you'll discover in the rest of the reviews. Many people are ecstatic that the game remains devoutly faithful, while a smaller minority are angry that the game lacks innovation. In my opinion its served them mostly well. The idea of a ""remake"", to me, is to provide a modern facelift to an older game while remaining true to what made the game so beloved mechanically and narratively when it was first introduced. Bluepoint has done just that to near perfection as far as I'm concerned. Combat and exploration are unchanged. That said, I'm not sure that the original Demon's Souls was ever that ""perfect of a game to begin with. It was From Software's first foray into this style of game and, as a result, it lacks the quality of life improvements of their more modern games. For example, checkpoints (archstones in Demon's Souls, bonfires in Dark Souls) are EXTREMELY sparse. Leading to unnecessary repetition of entire stages should a boss best you. Granted, this isn't a huge concern as many of the bosses are mechanically very simple and/or very easily defeated once you've discovered their ""gimmick."" In comparison to the bosses of later FS games, these fights are laughably simple, but still offer a good challenge to a beginner going into the game blind. Art direction, stage design, and build flexibility was and still is a highlight. Story is out there to be discovered but is not handed over. You must seek out the answers to your questions via the environment or NPC's. This helps to further immerse you into the position of the player character in my personal opinion. Unfortunately, this also means you can miss a large chunk of the narrative should you decide to ignore NPC's outside of what they have to sell you. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to someone who's never played any From Software ""Souls"" style game before. I believe it's the best game to be introduced to this style of game, due to it being ""relatively"" easier than the other titles. If you've played the likes of Bloodbourne, Dark Souls 3, or Sekiro, this will seem like a mechanical step backwards. If you're a die-hard fan of the original i'd be surprised to find you dislike the remake."
889,Stoys,"Feb  3, 2021",8,"The game looks soo good. and it plays really well.even though blueprint has  done an over the top job making this game feel like a new game,there are still some old mechanics that makes me dislike the game.like the  ""punishment"" for helping others in a world.there is no replay value other then the trophies and platinum.and the pvp is broken IMO. hit boxes and stuff is soo wierd.But i overall loved the game.and i would recommend it too every ps5 owner as this is a really good ekslusive game!i wish future soulsborne games are gonna look like this or hopefully better!"
890,ZXSth,"Jun 24, 2021",8,"As the first real new Souls game in quite some time, and with many among the fans of the series waiting with bated breath for Elden Ring, Demon's Souls has great potential to quench the thirst of any veteran of the series. At the same time, this game felt, to me, more like an appetizer than a fully realized game - I was truly invested, and I was craving something more by the end. I cannot speak from the perspective of someone who is experiencing the remake as their second visit to Boletaria - I come into this as a veteran of the 3 main Souls games, and as someone who (I am ashamed to admit) gave up on Bloodborne. As such, the stand-out features of this game, for me, were: Its absolutely gorgeous graphics; its smooth performance and nearly inexistent load times; and its loyalty to the trademarks of the games that game after (or before, depending on your perspective) it. What leaves me slightly irked is that Demon's Souls definitely feels like a predecessor, and some of its mechanics really shows the game's age when compared to the complexity of games that came after it, especially Dark Souls 2 and 3. For someone like myself, who came into the game fresh, it felt like more Souls, and that was phenomenal. But even with that fact in mind, I still found the game to have the least replay value of any game in the series, and I could only muster one playthrough of New Game Plus (which, for what it's worth, was easily the toughest NG+ experience I've ever had in any Souls game ever). My many, many playthroughs of Dark Souls 2 and 3, and even my 3 to 4 of Dark Souls speak to two things: That the Souls formula is starting to show its age; and that Demon's Souls probably needed to be a bit more than an extremely (perhaps even problematically) faithful remake with a fresh coat of beautiful paint. Demon's Souls is a great game - it's also a fantastic introduction to the series, and a wonderful way for those who didn't play the original to immerse themselves in the game that kickstarted a gaming legacy. But for those who have played the original, I'm not sure there is enough here to substantiate more than a single playthrough, if even that. For what my experience is worth, however, I thoroughly enjoyed my  time with Demon's Souls, even if it didn't last quite as long as I had hoped it would."

892,giannis2001,"Mar  8, 2021",8,"I love From Software's souls games and Demon's Souls was the first one ever made. It's actually pretty great they remade it because I never had the chance to play it on PS3. The game overall is really good but I personally enjoyed the others souls game more. Most likely because of the mechanics. Dark Souls games have more mechanics on gameplay like Plunging attack, jump, poise etc. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the gameplay of Demon's Souls as well. Also, it's the first of the series so it's only natural to lack mechanics and it's actually better than the remake didn't change that since they wanted to make it like the original. As of the visuals, there is no denial that they are the best we have seen yet on a souls game,and from the best in general. I highly recommend the game and if you find it hard (I personally believe it's the easiest of all the other souls games) you can get tips by walkthroughs that make the game way easier to beat."

913,joel_tdl,"Jun 17, 2021",8,"El padre de Bloodborne. JUGABILIDAD:El Demon's Souls original fue uno de esos títulos que impusieron moda, que sona ser imitados y mejorados hasta el cansancio. Para mí no es posible iniciar ésta reseña sin mencionar a Bloodborne como la obra maestra que es y que, por supuesto, nace gracias a éste titulo. Pues bien, hablando de éste Remake hay que comenzar con su sistema de combate, que es probablemente el apartado más importante en un Souls. Dicho apartado es decente, aunque ciertas armas se prestan mucho a hacer spam de R1, lo cuál facilita la mayoría de los enemigos y jefes. En consecuencia de lo anterior, yo no lo considero un sistema pausado, y lo que mejor me funcionó fue un método de ataque rápido y agresivo. Los jefes son buenos (¿o malos?), pero tienen mecánicas bastante simples: movesets bastante predecibles, muy repetitivos y en su mayoría muy simples de evitar. No es que el juego sea fácil (aunque es un paseo por el parque comparado con Bloodborne o Nioh), pero acostumbrarnos a una estrategia funcional es muy rápido... y dicha estrategia va a funcionar básicamente con todos los enemigos. Además, el uso de magia puede facilitar DEMASIADO la pelea contra varios de ellos. Así que si buscan un reto mayor, lo mejor es no invertir en éste apartado. La cantidad y uso de los ítems se siente más bien poca, pero sumado al equipo, son los necesarios para darle algún tipo de profundidad. Por su parte, el sistema de inventario es interesante: el juego nos provee de un cambio respecto a los típicos límites de inventario “por slots”, asignando en su lugar un límite por peso. Pero eso sí, me hubiera gustado que al tener el inventario al peso máximo, simplemente no pudieras recoger más objetos, en lugar de tener la opción de enviarlos al almacén.Sea como sea, creo que está bien manejado y no juega como punto en contra como le ocurre a juegos de otros desarrolladores (coff coff Nioh). Otro punto a favor que hay que mencionar es la libertad de poder jugar los escenarios en el orden que queramos, lo cual le da un buen toque, ya que podemos cambiar de área cuando nos sintamos atascados en alguna. Y es que con la integración al SSD, nos tomará meros segundos el saltar de área-a-nexo-a-área.Además, las zonas son tan variadas (tanto en estilo, época, ambientación, enemigos, y estructura) que hacen gala del apartado visual al tiempo que nos dan esa sensación de novedad. El tema de la tendencia de los mundos es muy interesante, y afecta directamente a la difitad de los niveles individuales. Pero en lo personal no supe aprovecharle y simplemente dejé que ocurriera sin prestarle demasiada atención. Por lo que en general, Demo's Souls Remake es un gran souls... con una difitad mas bien moderada. Algo obligatorio que hay que mencionar: el juego se me crasheó en dos ocasiones y hubo necesidad de reiniciar la consola. No presenta un “problema” por el sistema de guardado automático del género (no perdí progreso), pero sigue siendo un gran error, que esperamos sea corregido. GRÁFICOS:Impresionante. El juego perfecto para estrenar el sistema Playstation 5.El nivel de detalle y acción en pantalla es increíble, la buenísima paleta de colores al mas puro estilo de fantasía oscura y la gran implementación del HDR son un deleite.Las áreas son tan diferentes entre sí, que hacen del juego la oportunidad perfecta para apreciar lo que el sistema PS5 puede lograr, sin exagerar en el hiperrealismo. Tanto los niveles oscuros, como los bien iluminados, lucen simplemente estupendos. La narrativa es buena, y las cinemáticas son dignas de repetirse varias veces. Así como de recordarse como un referente en el género fantástico. SONIDO:Complicado... no tengo mucho qué decir: mientras que, por una parte, considero que algunas piezas son increíbles, hay una parte de mí que me dice que no disfruté del soundtrack como debería.Probablemente se debe al hecho de estar ""concentrado"" en otros aspectos jugables. Y si bien, es enteramente mi pa, ésta es mi reseña y debe reflejar mi apreciación personal de los apartados del videojuego. INNOVACIÓN:El primero de su respectiva “franquicia” ... bueno, no realmente. Es el Remake de aquel, por lo tanto no se puede considerar su innovación como algo fríamente parteaguas. Eso sí, confirma que de original, Bloodborne tiene poco: algunos jefes y sus mecánicas son claramente similares, por no decir prácticamente calcados. Pero esto ya no corresponde a la review de este titulo."

916,Shtern,"Aug  9, 2021",3,"Наверное самое худшее во что я играл из Souls Like игр, это первая игра в которой мне было по настоящему скучно, просто бить миллион лет мобов, бить миллион лет мобов и все это на первой локации, но даже так, если сначала игра кажется интересной и захватывающей, то это только поначалу. Как только мы побеждаем 2 босса в этой локации, нам нельзя идти дальше пока мы не убьем какого-то архидемона ""В рот оно Е*Б*С*"" вы уходите и что вы можете наблюдать с горем пополам у вас будет может быть 25к Душ, вы их тратите на характеристики, потом что-то там сортируете и дальше у вас 5 обелисков еще 1 из которых сломан и как говорится гуляй рука балдей игрок, но вот ты стараешься идти по кругу, а тут тебе херас два, мобы уже на второй локе фармятся нормально, только ударами в спину, то есть игра как бы говорит тебе, ЧЕЛ если хочешь тут быть, страдай, я понимаю что суть игры страдать, но сука, не на каждом же обычном мобе, потому что там, сука, есть еще усиленные, ну даладно мучаясь от того что пытаешься делать все снова и снова, доходишь еле как до босса во второй локе, убиваешь этого злоебучего паука и дальше начинается Ад, потому что ты банально просто нее можешь пройти нормально, но даже так, ты себя пересиливаешь, добегаешь до личинки которая сидит в тунеле, фармишь её минут 5, что бы пройти и там находишь босса, который тебя в порошек стирает, а ты даже не успеваешь патерн в его поведении увидеть, не то что придумать как и чем его бить.После всей этой вакханалии и смертей в миллион раз, ты замечаешь вот что, в мире этом, появляются какие то красные мобы, то есть считай охотники, как в БЛАД БОРНЕ, ты их убиваешь, но порой встречаешь таких, от которых у тебя просто жопа сгорает, что со мной и случилось.Так вот я узнал про эту конченую механику тенденции мира, я начал просто, сука, УМИРАТЬ, то есть тебе игра говорит, хочешь доп контент? Сдохни раз 5-7 в форме чела, а потом страдай ради чего? А хуй его, просто страдай, так я встретил в самой перовой локе за воротами бабу, которая выглядела как палач, 1 удар и я мертв, найс баланс я бы сказал, так вот, вроде заучив патерн ее поведения, я, вдумайтесь сейчас, 33 минуты хороводы водил и пиздил ее что бы убить, ибо 1 ошибка = смерть, что и случилось, после этого у меня уже сил и желания в это играть не было. Игра должна быть сложной и веселой одновременно, что бы у меня было желание превозмогать себя снова и снова, как я делал в Блад Борне и Дарк Соулсе, но нет, тут просто настолько скучно и однотипно, что тебе просто играть уже не хочется, я играл неделю, если не больше, я ни в одной игре столько раз не умер по приколу сколько тут, но от того что я валяюсь, как в World Of Warcraft мертвый из-за ПВП постоянно играть вообще не хочется."
917,IcarusRyukiZ,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"A truly masterpiece. With great graphics, detail, visual and music remake. Definitely recommended! But it is a challenging games to new comer. But always try, dead is just a way to learn this game"
918,Filmanwalt,"Mar 28, 2021",8,"So the game is over after 30 hours and 29 minutes as well as level 85. To classify you should note that I have played Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro before (right before this Playthrough), but Demon's Souls is the first of all this Games. But it was clear to me from the start that I would only play this game in the remake. story Soul title, everything is very, very interesting, you only understand half of it and are still happy about the ""story background noise"" that always accompanies you. King, annihilation, demons, bondage to the nexus; everything cool as always.Spoiler: to the endI let the young lady with the dirty feet do her job! I don't know if she could have been killed too. Graphics / performance / glitches The game looks awesome. It's probably the prettiest game out there on nextgen consoles right now. The graphics are incredible, the atmosphere is very well absorbed and I like the overall look of the game very much. The individual areas all have something for themselves, are sufficiently different in their look and the Latria tower, as well as the storm area, optically appealed to me best, next to the first world. The game went really well and I played it in performance mode. Occasionally there were a few lootglitches, but this is absolutely to be overlooked. On the other hand, I have to mention how bugged the gargoyles were on me. One glitch after the other, attacking the air or getting stuck on the bridge, etc. once I had to end the bossfight for the time being because the creature simply glitched away. It's a shame and I haven't seen it in any other soul game. Gameplay So right after Sekiro you have the feeling of being a snail and walking at a snail's pace. It's very sluggish, but after a bit of getting used to it, I was completely back in it and I didn't mind. Then it was that special Souls feeling again. I really liked the weapons and while I played with the Claymore relatively quickly for a long time, I used boss weapons especially towards the end, after I figured out how it worked. I found the old hero's blade really cool, so I played it through. I also liked some boss fights very much, but these were mainly those fights that were more reminiscent of Dark Souls (e.g. the Flame Sneak or Penetrator). I didn't really like that many of the boss fights consisted of mechanics that you just had to carry out and the boss was down (e.g. the dragon god, who for me is one of the most boring bosses of all soul games). What all bosses have in common is that they are far too easy. The last two bosses or the penultimate one was cool but totally easy (maybe I was already relatively high in the level, but the bosses were already very easy before). The last two bosses also rather disappointed me as the ""final boss"", and to be honest, I didn't realize that that was the end. In addition to the at least lame boss fights, at least in terms of gameplay, there are farms that are probably not absolutely necessary but felt very helpful (I mainly farmed souls here in order to then buy arrows, herbs, etc.). Fortunately, they shut down this farm aspect in the soul games and I never really farmed in any Dark Souls part. After all, there is a place in Demons Souls later that makes it extremely easy to farm many souls (it's actually quite fun) or there are different farm spots. What is left to say ... oh yes the world trend. Wasn't my thing, I have to say honestly, because I prefer, as in the successors, that I discover secret ways (e.g. by hitting the wall). I don't want to compare too much with the successors, but I ended up playing Demons Souls as the last and I'm glad that Fromsoft has changed a lot. I still have two points of criticism: The simple chaining of worlds reminded me too much of Dark Souls 2. In Dark Souls 1 it was just better with the world network. And inventory management sometimes pissed me off, especially because I always had the load too heavy and constantly had to swap things around. Conclusion Again, I emphasized my points of criticism of the game, but that doesn't change the fact that I had a lot of fun for 30 hours and 29 minutes. Demons Souls is part of a long success story of these games and I liked it better than Dark Souls 2. With 8/10 demon souls it is very well served, but despite the same rating, it is under Dark Souls 1 for me and is ""significantly"" weaker than the rest of the games. This ends my journey at Fromsoftware ... for now."

920,Rektnarok91,"Jul 17, 2021",6,"It's gorgeous but man... it definitely feels like the ""first"" souls game. It's slower, more tedious, clunkier, and the story is a bit more straightforward than the unique plots of later games. This isn't a remake (like Resident Evil 2) it's just a graphical update.Weirdly it's the easiest From game I've played but you die more to annoyance and jankiness than to legit challenge. I found little joy fighting through the mobs of easy enemies to get back to an area you died to falling or some other kind of bs.Especially after playing DS3, Bloodbourne, and Sekiro this feels downright in slow motion and boring. But regardless, DS1 (and even DS2) holds up, and I played it after the new games because it's a really unique and challenging experience. Honestly, I don't get who this remake is for? It won't recapture the magic of playing it on the PS3 for veterns and isn't updated for newer gamers.Except for the graphics, 60fps, and quick loading there is nothing about this made for modern game sensibilities. It feels too much like King's Field before Dark Souls came into its own. I know die hard fans are glad it's exactly the same as the original, but I really wish they updated aspects of the game and attempted a true remake.Still, if it's your first souls game then I think I suggest it because it still is great compared to most games if you've never experienced the Fromsoft formula. But if you have, this will probably bore you."

923,Explicit1,"May 10, 2021",9,This is an incredibly faithful remake. The only demerit and criticism that I can give is that Bluepoint should have improved the bad aspects of the enemies and bosses that are still present here in the remake from the original game.

Would have been a 10 but the implementation of adaptive triggers is quite poor on the bow.

927,Electrohead,"Jan 11, 2021",9,"This is ultimately the same experience as the original; which is to say the game is excellent. The graphical presentation is outstanding and is an overall great technical showcase for the PlayStation 5. BluePoint also included some nice 'quality of life' updates, such as being able to warp to any Archstone rather than having to always return to the Nexus. Some negatives I had were the fact that the game's crafting system still requires a lot of unnecessary grinding for specific items and the music in the remake isn't as memorable as the original. BluePoint also chose to pass on the opportunity to 'fix' the broken Archstone as well as redesign the lame 'Dragon God' boss fight. Despite some minor nit-picks, this is the definitive version of the game."
928,Szntax,"May 22, 2021",9,"I was new to the whole From Software franchise. I heard about Dark Souls and Blodborne but hardly played them. Why is that ? These games have absolutely no intention to make things easy for you. Every Action hast ist consequences, run around beat a NPC and be surprised of having Killed en important merchant or worse. The most discouraging thing might be the difficulty. Meet two opponents in the begining and be surprised on how they beat you up. Later on Meeting end Bosses who seem impossible to beat, but the more you keep on , the more you probably improve. But have Twitch, Wikipedia and friends to help you along and things get better. Whats to love here ? The graphics are cool, the fighting ist fun, the Investory is super minimalistic, but most of the items have their use case, so when you find an item, you can be happy. There are always solutions, always things to find out and always some surprising death traps on the way , that don’t even pretend to be fair. But after you spent hours to beat an impossible boss, that is very rewarding. Lot´s of places to explore, lots of enemies waiting to be slain, and lot of items waiting to be found."

937,srinu634,"Feb  4, 2021",10,"Demon's souls is a very game with stunning visuals and grueling atmosphere. Bluepoint Games has done a great job with the remake and it looks visually so pleasing. Also, it's so nice to have the option of selecting Performance vs better graphics and the 60 fps performance mode runs so smoothly on ps5. What differentiates this game from Dark souls 3 is that, In Dark souls 3, the bosses are pretty difficult but I personally found them to be easy in Demon's souls. Also, Demon's souls has better level design which vary from tunnels to prisons to swamps. The combat of Dark souls 3 felt faster compared to Demon's souls.  Of course, this is a personal opinion. As per cons, I noticed that the locking mechanism sucks in this game. It's frustrating and sometimes just doesn't work when each split second matters but you are trying to lock onto the enemy and end up dying :| ."

Większość śmierci zawdzięczam ... grawitacji. Tak, umarłem bite 40 razy, spadając z głupich przepaści albo robiąc unik na wąskiej drodze, Fun: 9,5/10 Bawiłem się przy Demon's Souls Remake naprawdę dobrze, jest to chyba moja ulubiona gra na playstation na ten moment. Modele przeciwników, rozbudowany system walki, który pozostawia wiele, rzeczy do dyspozycji graczom, a także rozbudowanie lokacji, to istne złoto i mam nadzieję, że coraz więcej gier będzie takich. Minusy: Brak dodania 6 krainy z Gigantami. Według mnie twórcy, jeżeli faktycznie robią remake to powinni pododawać więciej od siebie, jak na przykład 6 archstone + praca kamery, w dużej części lokacji jest beznadziejna."

For a game that is all about its atmosphere, immersion and gameplay, a remake that presents the game in unbelievable 60 FPS detail, with perfect sound and controller feedback, and almost non-existing load time between areas, makes the Demon's Souls experience come to life like never before, doing the original From Software vision for the game full justice and a little more. I bought the PS5 solely for this game, and my sky high expectations were easily met - just fire that Soul Arrow once, and you know what I mean. Sorry, Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne, The old king has returned and once again claimed the top spot. Best game ever made? I am hard pressed to find a finer example of the art form."

The combat has only improved with better actions and more fluid combat and this makes it more enjoyable to play than the original which has some outdated mechanics. My only issue with the remake is the fact it has lost some of its charm it once had. The soundtrack whilst impressive as a score is not very memorable or fitting since all the tracks are mostly orchestral. The original had such good variety in its music and some of the boss soundtracks are totally inferior in the remake. As a result I can't really memorise the music in this game. On the other side of things some places have lost the atmosphere they once had. Not sure if it's the modern graphics or the redesign but this also takes away some of the charm. Overall however it was overall a solid game."

This is a beautiful game, and a great showpiece for the power of next-gen consoles. But while this game is very visually appealing, unfortunately it remains the worst of the Soulsborne-style games. This game features levels that are interesting and engaging your first few times through. The problem is that they are incredibly punishing marathons and feature few to no shortcuts. So you will die a million times, and getting through the levels becomes a tedious chore. And then, for some reason, most bosses are easier than the levels that preceded them. Thankfully, FromSoftware reversed this trend for the rest of the Soulsborne games. Levels can be challenging, but you unlock shortcuts that are much more respectful of your time. The bosses in those games are often very challenging, but each death means usually just a short walk back to the boss."

The game has been remade very meticulously and is perhaps the best souls remake to date."

975,Ligth-Bringer,"Jul 26, 2021",9,"Demons souls its a great game that shows what the PS5 can do, breath taking visuals and fast loading worlds. its a bit easy at times (some regular enemies are harder than 2 or 3 of the bosses AI needed a update to react faster but that's all the bad things) but i have played and finished all the other souls games. if you love dark souls you'll love this especially if you never played the original demon souls. recommended."
976,Yo-Ho,"Dec 15, 2020",5,"I really enjoyed the original, but this remake didn't do it for me, it's just so different in terms of atmosphere and visuals. The visuals do not match the lore and it's really annoying. The music is butchered and the enemy designs are worse."

979,DanceroftheLoth,"Dec 19, 2020",8,"I really enjoyed Demon's Souls Remake, and blupoint did a very solid job at remaking this ps3 classic, but i had a few issues. First Demon's Souls is the easiest souls game ever and the fact that the Gameplay wask 99% the same was a little bit disappointing, and some areas looked a bit different but overall this remake is a really good showing of ps5's power and a really solid entry in playstation's catalog."
980,YoelofLothric,"May 11, 2021",9,"The remake is so beautiful , the Gameplay could have used some work but i love the fact that they kept it the same, i hope this souls title brings joy to every gamer out there, hope one day it comes to PC."

999,SpookyBoogie8,"Jan 24, 2021",9,"I didn't play the original. This was my 1st game to buy and play on PS5, and it met most of my expectations. I played it every chance I got and platinumed it after 60 hours. Stunning visuals, great soundtracks and sound system. When the dragon swoops over the bridge the bass booming in my headphones and haptics made me feel legitimately scared. Tower knight fight is something I will never forget, the feel of steel hitting steel is a great demonstration of PS5's next gen capabilities and is executed superbly.Now onto negatives. There isn't much that Bluepoint studio introduced gameplay wise. I wish the world 4 was longer. I only played DS3 from the soulsborne series, so comparing it to DS3 I wish this had a higher replay value, it feels much shorter and there seem to be less builds you can try (I played as a spell sword). As I platinumed it I don't feel compelled to replay it immediately like I wanted  with DS3. But I'm holding on  to my physical copy because I probably will one day."
1000,Deathbyrope,"Aug  5, 2021",9,"This game is truly amazing and I'm glaf it was remade for the ps5. The duelsense controller and graphics truly shine on this one and of course the remade textures, motion capture and cutscenes looked amazing and suited it well. The music and ambience was done really well too."
1001,Rydberg98,"Jan 28, 2021",10,"First I have to say, I didn't play the original. I played Bloodborne and Sekiro, so I'm not new to the souls genre. For somebody who hasn't had the chance to play the origin of the Souls Series I was excited to play the Remake, as I don't own (or will ever buy) a PS3 console now. First warning: If you're not into hard games with unchangeable difficulty level, then go away, because you probably will be frustrated by this game. That being said, it is a nice start in the Souls Series because it it easier than Bloodborne for example. If you understand a boss you can probably beat him even with terrible timing. Level Design stays close to the original I heard and isn't nearly as clever as in Bloodborne. Before some Bosses there are shortcuts, before others not. Nonetheless I liked the game and the bosses, because they were diverse and after a few tries easy to beat. The graphics are astonishing, though not as scary and depressing as in the original (as far a I can tell from youtube videos). The remake has some quality of life improvements (send to storage function, sodden ring). Online Mode ist nice, but for the start you should play offline until you are confident enough to encounter other players who want to kill you (or if your are struggling with a boss and need some help). Like any other soul game, you have to figure out good builds, weapons and additional stuff on your own. No shame to seek help in Lets Play and Walk Throughs for the start. I also liked the Soundtrack, though I heard from many that the OST in the original was better. I think it ist mostly because of nostalgia, I would also be angry if they made a Bloodborne remake and changed the soundtrack, because during countless Boss fights this music burned itself into my mind. When you played the original your are not set to like the remake, but in my opinion you should give it a chance. For me this remake was justified because the souls series gained its fanbase mostly through Dark Souls and Bloodborne, so most of them haven't had the chance to play this game. I am glad I was able to and don't regret buying it for 80€. High Price, yes, but worth it I guess. Especially to call it robbery, like some of the reviews did, is an exaggeration. Wait for a sale if it's too much for you or honor the developers if you can afford it."
1002,RaptorNemesis,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"Le meilleur jeu next gen pour le moment et en plus un remake. Comme quoi retravailler les textures, les éclairages, les paters des boss et garder le scénario ainsi que l'ambiance de l'original, fait de se jeu la grosse exclue PS5."

1007,lhunsaker,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"Bluepoint Games has delivered a spectacular revival of one of my all-time favorite games. The only reason the user score for this game isn’t higher is because people are review-bombing this game since it wasn’t remade exactly how they wanted it. From an unbiased standpoint, this game is a technical wonder and is visually/audially a masterpiece (Playing with 3D audio is a MUST). The game plays precisely as it did on PS3, with some quality-of-life improvements (like being able to roll in more than just 4 directions while locked-on). There is also a breathtaking new soundtrack that builds from the original. Cant say enough about how great this remake is.This game will challenge you, immerse you, and if you’ve played the original, leave you feeling incredibly nostalgic. Overall, the experience is second-to-none."
1008,SergioPinto,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"This game is Bluepoint Games's greatest accomplishment yet. They managed to surpass the original Demon's Souls, which was already an incredible game. In its place, they created what I consider to be THE BEST Souls game to date. The attention to detail is superb, translating into breathtaking visuals and a vivid atmosphere. The gameplay, although tweaked a little in order to modernize it, remains true to the original. The game is personally much more enjoyable now, since not only were some of the original game's faults corrected, like a less fluid combat system (which feels very intuitive in the new game), but also some of the new elements like weight on plants add a new layer of difficulty. The improvement in graphics is surreal, as Bluepoint redid all the models and textures in the game. Not only that, but things like animations and lighting have also been highly upgraded. Other elements like shadows and water dynamics behave as if it were real life. The level of polish in this game is practically unmatched right now. Some would even call this game a true cinematic experience. In short, this is a must-have for all players. PS: The people giving this game a rating of zero, one or two are either clearly trolls or have nostalgia glasses too deep into their eyesight."
1009,KillerGmbH,"Feb  6, 2021",8,"The last from Software Game i had not finished on my list.The biggest thing are those graphics, the look awsome!!For everything els, mhhh its an old game with old mechanics. But still better than most games today.Levels are harden then the bosses. Souls games are normally all about the boss fights, this game is about the atmosphere and the levels.For an game of 2009 its one of the best, now in 2021 its great but with flaws."

1011,MortalRide,"Jul 11, 2021",10,"This game man, this game... I started souls games with this game. I have played Bloodborne before. But i rage quit at the bridge where there are 3 dogs waiting to attack me. But unlike Bloodborne, Demon's Souls wrapped me with its arms. It didn't let me go. Sure, when i started to play first time, i got frustrated easily. But this is what Souls games do. You have to be patient and try again and again. After that when you got strong, the pleasure that you feel is unexplainable. You can feel your attack hit the enemy more beautifully, unlike many other games. This is a PS3 game when you look back through the history, But when you play it, it doesnt feel like it. It feels like a next gen game from the ground up. I thank to From Software (for doing a core mechanic like this for beyond its time) and Bluepoint Games (for doing such a crazy remastered game like this and making all people call this game remake). The words become insufficient for describing this game. Thank you again. I recommend everyone to play this game. Also if you have time, you should play with every character and try different builds. Because all these characters and all these builds would make you feel that you are playing a new game but not the same game. FYI : I got the Platinum Trophy  :)"

1019,CandleWax,"Oct  2, 2021",8,"As a pretty big souls fan, I was very excited to see a new souls game coming out for the ps5, although a little skeptical since it was made by Bluepoint and not fromsoftware. I have never played the original demon souls for the ps3 so I went into this game completely blind and excited, and I was not let down, though its not a 10/10 because of a couple issues. Story- Like all the other souls games, Demon Souls tells a great story through its world, npc dialogue,  and item descriptions. There are many interesting characters with their own quest lines that are fun to complete as well as some great bosses that of course have their own story to tell. Gameplay- I really like the weighty feel of all the weapons in this game, even the spells which I never used in ds3, it makes all the weapons seem powerful in their own way. I would have to say the biggest problem with the game was the bonfires, they are very spaced out, making every time you die more of a chore to get back to where you were, it can be very bad when there are more maze like areas which can make back tracking a real hassle. Other than that, exploring the super atmospheric areas that are crawling with enemies and dangerous hazards, while still being beautiful, is some of the most fun I had with this game, and the best part is at the end of an area, they throw a challenging boss at you.Bosses:  Some bosses are great, challenging yet fair, fun to learn, and cool/ intriguing designs, but there are a couple bosses that do feel a bit lack luster, either because they were way too easy or redundant, like the dragon god which was less of a fight and more of a puzzle. Weapons: Its almost a good and bad thing that you can tell that this is the game that started the souls franchise, because there are not many weapons in this game, mainly in comparison with all the others. This might just be a me thing, but I wished there was a wider selection, especially when you are choosing a strength build, you just do not get a lot of choices. Other than that, a lot of the weapons are very cool, and like I said before, they have a nice feel to them and some weapons were a real challenge to get yet rewarding. The light and dark mechanic: Since iv never played the original I was kind of confused about this mechanic in the game, I dont feel like going into depth on what it is, but to sum it up, each area can have either a ""light tendency"" or a ""dark tendency"", you get a certain amount of light tendency by killing enemies and bosses, and dark by skipping enemies, killing npcs, and dying too much. I did not like this mechanic very much and I felt like it could have just not been in the game, mainly because there are some items or quests that require a certain tendency, so sometimes you will have to start a new playthrough just to acquire and item you missed because you weren't killing enough enemies and were dying too much, as well as the fact that this mechanic has no bearing on the outcome ending, as far as I can tell. Graphics: Not much to say, graphics are amazing and it runs great, definitely looks like a triple A game for a next gen console I would recommend demon souls to both new and seasoned souls players. There are a couple issues with this game, but compared to what the game gets right, those issues can be overshadowed. Along with the new ratchet and clank, the Demon Souls Remake by Bluepoint is a great way to start of the ps5."
1020,Nikita1298,"Jul 27, 2021",10,"This game is the first souls-like game in my life. I’ve been playing Demon’s Souls for a week and I can say that this game is absolutely amazing. Why I like it:- cool enemies. Some bosses are really difficult. Rarely seen in games.- fast loading. If you die, you are reborn in 1-2 seconds- graphics and sound. Experiencing total immersion- game length. If I buy a game for 60$ I wanna play for more than 15 hours"

1022,Onefunnyguy,"Mar  8, 2021",10,"Visually stunning game that is actually running two game engines at once; Bluepoint has their engine handling all visuals while the original game's engine is responsible for combat timing and logic. So it still plays like a From Soft game but looks absolutely amazing. Bluepoint is much better at netcoding thsn From Soft, so online play has been very smooth.This is probably the best example of a next gen game available right now. Even if you don't think From Software games are your thing, I urge you too give it a shot."

1025,Chandler43,"Apr  9, 2021",10,"A masterpiece that got a fresh coat of paint. There's nothing wrong with this game except that if you aren't good at challenging games then expect to not be a fan of Demon Souls. It's the easiest of all the Soul games but still can be challenging if you are not familiar with it. Blue Point stayed true to the original and buffed up all the glitches and errors. It's definitely a masterpiece and worth getting a PS5 for, however, the 70$ asking price for a already made game is a little ridiculous. But 60 and below is worth it."
1026,ariangoodarzi,"Apr 24, 2021",4,personally i think demon's soul is the worst souls game after dark souls 2 graphicly it looks amazing. the gameplay is pretty good but my god the balance is really really bad. the magic builds are just op. the pvp sucks. the melee builds are not nearly as good as the magic ones it is unbalanced as heck. the story is alright nothing really that special tho. the bosses have borken hitboxes however they are really damn fun to fight against. the map design is really damn linear. not even close to dark souls 1. the actuall pve is really fun and the enemys are really cool.so yeah 4.5 score from me

Beautiful to look at ugly to play.
1048,Tromble,"Jun 28, 2021",9,Demon's Soul's (2020) works its absolute hardest to improve and polish the rough edges of the original. Although Demon's Soul's (2020) is sometimes misguided in its changes (particularly when tampering with the art direct of enemies/armour) it does far for good than harm. This complete remake would easily push Demon's Souls to a 10 if it was not for the fatal flaw of lacking an ability to manage your characters without deleting all of them. This is such a strange oversight for a well established and Triple A studio. I would highly recommend either iteration of Demon's Souls.
1049,Bodhi_Hoatzin,"Aug  8, 2021",6,"The fact that Bluepoint didn't do anything to introduce more basic, QoL features and took virtually no liberties to improve upon any of the original game's design flaws made for an extremely disappointing if not frustrating experience. For the majority of my time playing, I found myself only fantasizing about how much better this game would be if it were more like its successors. While the bulk of the game makes for a good experience, the remainder holds it back severely. Lest we even acknowledge the price... Overall a very disheartening experience."

1051,Carlink,"Jul 27, 2021",10,"I only played Bloodborne and Dark Souls Remastered from Souls saga (the second I could not finish it). I bought a PS5 pack and I had to choose a game, I wasn't sure for Demon's Souls... and what a blast of a game, one of the best I have played in my life. Stunning graphics, lots of fun... if you have a PS5, you have to play it."
1052,Tademon,"Aug 25, 2021",10,"A true next gen experience. I would welcome more QoL changes from the original, however the game still deserves a 10."
1053,DKRules,"Aug  6, 2021",10,"Truly incredible. Although certainly not perfect, as no such game exists, I believe this is everything a remake should. Faithful to the original, while still putting so much care and totally revamping the game including lightning-fast load times, probably the best graphics I've ever seen in a console game and adding a few quality of life improvements such as being able to send items to storage at any time. It certainly is a brutal challenge, even though it is quite objectively the easiest souls game... which isn't really saying much. Overall incredible experience and one that I cannot recommend enough."
1054,blankcheck,"Aug 13, 2021",4,"This is a good tech demo for the system, but the gameplay is weak.  I've played and highly enjoyed every other FromSoftware game from Dark Souls through Sekiro, so I was looking forward to this.  It looks really pretty, but playing it is seriously tedious.  It's more of a super-remaster than an updated remake - crappy gameplay elements from 2009 didn't need to make it into a 2021 release.  Clunky & slow, needlessly grindy (like getting herbs), bad online gameplay, and some odd remake-specific decisions...if you've played any of Demon's Souls successors, you've gotten used to playing with the improvements made to these original elements, and it's likely this game will feel pretty poor in comparison.  But it looks great."
1055,Unonesimo,"Aug 13, 2021",10,"Juegazo donde los haya. Una dificultad bien medida, unos graficos increibles, una jugabilidad a prueba de bombas y una rejugabilidad casi infinita.Un juego de 10"
1056,Soco9135,"Aug 26, 2021",0,"Wow a game i played long time ago, fortunately i didn t need to pay for this game, when Playstation want to milk you, they will milk you like cows."
1057,Philspencer,"Aug 22, 2021",10,this game is amazinggreat ostgameplaygraphicsmemorable moments everything is perfect
1058,DOOM5814,"Aug 23, 2021",10,Лучший стартовый эксклюзив!! Крутая игра! Мой первый опыт в souls жанре. Очень понравилось!!!
1059,Marc_craM,"Sep  6, 2021",9,"Have beaten all demon/dark souls series (and bloodborne)..and this was a great experience. Yes, it's challenging and you will die a lot. Yes, you will get pissed off and scream f*ck or want to throw your controller..but, like all souls games, it's as rewarding as it is challenging. Overall, I would give it a 9. Play with a headset to enjoy the 3D audio. I cannot give a 10 as it's a remaster and there's nothing transformative when compared to the original in 2009, outside of the graphics."
1060,Emberspirit,"Sep 15, 2021",10,"Wonderful 9.5/10 ,i love thisDEMON'S SOULS remake.Graphic,sound,haptic feedback is amazing.."
1061,MalikTheGamer,"Sep 17, 2021",0,ran out of ideas ? sure lets remake a bad bad souls gamesdeserves zero ....
1062,Jmaneater21,"Sep 20, 2021",10,Beautiful game smashed all of my expectations of a video game. I'll be playing this game for years to come.
1063,Bendeagle,"Sep 21, 2021",10,This is the best remake I ever played and as a soulslike fan I loved it. Plus ultra!

1065,Koernerbrot,"Oct  7, 2021",10,"This is not just a texture pack as many here claim. Bluepoint has (re)developed this game from the ground up. They stayed true to the original, so lore, gameplay, level design, etc. are just as awesome as the original, but this time with some quality of life improvements, outstanding graphics, buttery smooth animations, constant 60fps, etc. I definitely recommend it for any SoulsBorne fan as an entry point on the PS5."
1066,fadz13,"Sep 28, 2021",10,"BluePoint Games are not just the masters of remasters and remakes, they are a GOATy tiered studio that's full of talent and they did an incredible job with Demon's Souls Remake for PS5. It's the best-looking game, period."
1067,Cookie_Punki,"Sep 29, 2021",8,"Demon's Souls Remake ha sido mi primer contacto con un juego Soulslike y la experiencia ha sido tremendamente positiva. Para alguien como yo, que desconocía este género, ha sido un auténtico desafío, especialmente los mundos 3 (Torre de Latria) y 5 (Valle de la Corrupción), y algunos jefes en NG+. Técnicamente es de lo mejorcito de PS5 hasta la fecha, la historia está muy bien narrada y me ha gustado todo lo referente al sistema de combate, las habilidades y armas propias de cada personaje, las distintas opciones de organizar el inventario, las particularidades de los anillos (¡larga vida al de agudeza mágica!) o la relevancia de algunos NPC durante tu partida. Bluepoint Games ha hecho un trabajo notable y ofrece 25-30 horas de diversión y frustración a partes iguales, y alrededor de 10 más si quieres completar una partida extra para conseguir el ansiado platino. Quizá podrían haber añadido un DLC –como veo que hizo FromSoftware con Bloodborne– y así justificar mejor su elevado precio."
