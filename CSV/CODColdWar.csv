0,JustGoblinV,"Nov 18, 2020",0,"It blows my mind that people are praising this game. Buggy as all get out and their servers are terrible. This is a BILLION $ publisher and a studio that has been making games since 1996. I understand they had to ""pick up slack"" from the other studio but my god what they released is just so bad and uncompetitive it pains me that I even wasted time trying to like it. Controller aim assist is actually better than some aim bots (aim bots use skeletal tracking and usually don't compromise for bullet velocity or player direction, whereas this aim assist does) and nobody talks about it because the majority like to feel like they are skilled players when it's really just the game. With no input-based matchmaking, turning off crossplay doesn't matter because everyone still uses controller. Snipers are slow but incredibly broken, no flinch, glint is hard to see, movement speed is fast, and they one shot ""chest level"" or if you're on controller - foot level and it will magnetize to the chest. The campaign was dull and felt like a Michael Bay movie, all action no story. Zombie. Pretty good, but that's it. One map with a 30min easter egg and bosses that are more annoying than intimidating. Hackers are back. Turning off crossplay to try actually playing against some M&K players I ran into hacker after hacker, blatantly aimbotting."
1,Unselles,"Nov 16, 2020",3,"This is honestly one of the worst Call of Duty games and a huge downgrade from 2019 Modern Warfare. I expected much more from Treyarch than this lazy cash-grab. It's like any other Call of Duty there is, no innovation, nothing. The only things this game does better than MW2019 is the objective play and in-game statistics, also move to scorestreaks. Campaign isn't too bad, it's just very generic gameplay wise.The weapon/character animations are janky and some look straight up horrible. Graphics are also pretty mediocre and downgraded, same for player movement and the maps. There is no more parkour, it's all very basic level design. The in-game camos are a joke, it's like from 2011. I know people say that the game is ""old-school"", but we don't live in 2011 anymore, people should higher standards than this."
2,Krisskan,"Nov 15, 2020",0,"My focus is on the multiplayer, it's awful. Honestly, The maps are a mess, they feel unbalanced and uninteresting. Can't bloody navigate an area without getting screwed by the spawn system. The guns are alright, but man do they lack variety. 5 assault rifles, 3 pistols, 2 launchers, 2 shotguns, etc. What the hell. That why the progression is slow as **** This game has been rushed, there is no point in denying that. It speaks for itself. Don't buy this, you are not missing anything worth experiencing."
3,Tranceholic,"Nov 15, 2020",0,"The game is utter SH*T , a step back from modern warfare in every mode , maps are horrible!  clearly the game was rushed AF"
4,Therien,"May 30, 2021",0,"Stay away if you are on PC. This game so rigged in favour of controller players you wanna kill yourself after 2 hours, and the campaign is boring AF."
5,MaxFlame,"May  8, 2021",0,Aimbot cheaters are everywhere in this game. For 20$ a month you are a champion in CoD. Activision doesn't care. All they want is your money for the skins.
6,Dullakhan,"Apr 11, 2021",2,I bought the game a few days ago so here's my take:Cold War is a decent game instead of another cod this year The Devs should focus on what would please the fans e.g taking out skill-based matchmaking and more weapons.
7,bam420,"Apr  8, 2021",0,"Shït ass trash ass game. All style, no substance. Maps suck. Sound design sucks. They even managed to ruin Hardcore mode. "
8,PaulLee,"Apr 24, 2021",3,"I can’t see s**t in most of the map. It's also really annoying to spawn within a bombing range or where people are fighting. And the most important balance in multiplayer is really the worst. It's one of the worst multiplayer games I've ever played. I don't know if I'm playing this game just to use a submachine gun, or if I'm playing this game with a smoke screen to catch the enemy behind the smoke screen with a thermal imaging scope. This game is wrong from the ground up. Everything from the engine that makes up the game to the gun balance must be reconfigured. Of course, the single player campaign was well made.  But that's it.Call of Duty: SMG Warfare"
9,alucard420,"May  6, 2021",0,"This game is an insult to the black ops franchise. Just like modern warfare, Its a mess. Please don't spent 60$ on this. R.I.P Call of Duty......"
10,Palel01,"Jun 10, 2021",3,"First, the story: The story is forgettable, its not boring, I do like the decitions part, but its easily forgettable.The zombies: The best part of the game, I personally dont like zombies that much in any COD, but here is not that bad, I liked it. The multiplayer: THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE GAME, THE COOL PART, THE PART OF THE GAME THAT IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU WANNA COME BACK TO THE GAME IIIIS **** boring...its the worst part of the game, just that, its bad, its **** Aslo, I hate what they did with warzone."
11,UmaSenpai,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"This game is unplayable in PC. It was performing well during the first two weeks then it starts disconnecting, lagging, stuttering and there is this one time that my PC stops working cos of the lag. I needed to force restart my PC. Hey Treyarch fix your game!"
12,ColMiller,"Apr 23, 2021",0,"This game is garbage. Treyarch is a garbage dev. Every update breaks my install, forcing me to troubleshoot for literal hours. The game itself is pretty bad, featuring one of the shortest times to kill I've withnessed outside of a mil-sim which this is not. What you see on screen is reflective of whats actually happening. Guns are boring and lack variety. Entire game wants to nickle and dime you so bad. I can't get this taste of **** out of mouth. I wouldn't buy this."
13,AndisMan432,"Jun  6, 2021",4,"The only good things you get from this game is decent campaign with okay characters and two endings, both equally as interesting. Zombies is also a more causal experience but is still fun and is always a nice mode to play while kicking back and relaxing. Honestly, the zombies is the best thing in this game and it's no where near as good as zombies in games like black ops 3.  Therefore, the single player modes/co-op modes are pretty good. However, multiplayer is really, really, really bad. It is one of the worst cod multiplayers since infinite warfare, in fact, I'd even say this is almost 2x worse. Maps are terrible, gunsmith is a down grade from mw 2019, it's littered with micro dlc and worst of all, match making is easily the worst it's been in the whole franchise. Skill based matchmaking is a joke and playing this game for long periods of time is a mental health threat. I would even go as far as to say this game's multiplayer makes it more of a, ""want to preform self-harm"" simulator then an enjoyable and rewarding experience. This game gets a 4/10 and all of those points come from single player and zombies, multiplayer is a flat out 0 for me, save yourself and go play Modern Warfare 2019, or quite literally any other cod from the past couple of years if you are looking for a good multiplayer game. However, if you only buy these games for single player or zombies, I would suggest getting it, those modes are solid."
14,FaiqGamer,"Mar 11, 2021",8,"My opinon/review on Black Ops: Cold War for PC. What's good in Black Ops Cold War PC:-Good Campaign-Dope Soundtrack-Decent weapon selection-Decent Gunsmith-Nice zombies mode, (inclduing the new one) What's Bad:-Skill Based Matchmaking-Maps are kinda unbalanced in some modes-Technical problems such as Disconnection/crash"

16,garethvk,"Jan 29, 2021",8,"Treyarch returns to Call of Duty with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and updates the franchise while staying true to what has made it such a massive success. Unlike Black Ops IIII, Cold War features a campaign and it is one that offers players side missions, alternate in-mission objectives, dialogue options, and differing endings. Set in the 80s but jumping in time to Vietnam and other timeline events; the player is cast as an operative named Bell. Players have the option to customize their character in terms of name, gender, backstory and such but it does not play much into the game as “Bell” is what players are known by. From Eastern Europe, to Vietnam, Cuba, and other locales, the game includes 80s technology and music as players must stop a Soviet General named Perseus from unleashing a Nuclear onslaught. As fans of the series can guess; players will undertake various missions using combat, stealth, infiltration, elimination, recovery, and more to save the day. There are all sorts of weapons for players to select from ranging from Western to Eastern and allows players to experience a variety of options from sniping, run and gun, and even a Bow. Vehicles also play a part of the game but they are more heavily featured in the multiplayer portion of the game. The game does offer variations on the ending based on a player’s choice of completing side missions and choices they make along the way and the game also offers players the chance to grab enemies and use them as a shield in taking on enemy fire. This is one option I would love to see appear in multiplay. The graphics are solid and some of the landscapes from jungle to frozen tundra really stand out as I was playing on an EVGA 2700 GTX card. The game was also considerably more stable than Modern Warfare was at launch as I did not encounter any issues with my gameplay. At first I thought the campaign was short but I later realized I had become so engrossed in it that I mistakenly thought so. The levels do offer some real treats which I would love to discuss but do not want to spoil. Multiplay is the bread and butter of the series as it is what drives the popularity of the series along as players will spend countless hours leveling up, customizing, and playing the various maps and modes as new content arrives until the release of the next game in the series. Some have complained that the maps are a bit sparse and uninspired but I have enjoyed my time in the multiplayer and enjoy the fact that I can now select only the modes I wish to play for Quickplay to avoid being placed in a mode I do not wish to play. The Co-Op Mode I enjoyed so much in Modern Warfare is gone this time around in favor of a Zombie mode and while it does not shake things up much from the prior Zombie offerings; it does offer plenty of entertainment and I look forward to seeing more content in the future. There is an Assault mode where players can use vehicles ranging from Tanks, Snowmobiles, Jet Skis, Gun Boats and more which adds to the fun as ramming your ride into a landing area which an explosive attached is great fun. The only issue I had with the game was with Warzone as attempting to launch it took me to desktop and out of the game so hopefully this will be smoothed out soon as new updates are already out for the game and next week will see the return of the popular Nuketown map which now is updated to 1984. In the end Black Ops Cold War does not reinvent the franchise but rather gives players more of what they have come to expect with a few new wrinkles to the mix. 4 stars out of 5sknr.net"
17,vbarbarian,"Dec 30, 2020",9,Can't stop playing the new zombies. Multiplayer is ok. People getting angry and leaving 0's because they can't quickscope noobs for 5 hours straight is pretty funny. Overall I like it.

21,Kunray,"Nov 16, 2020",1,"rather lackluster, not much content, far too overhyped for what we got unfortunately, if  doesnt turn this train around the future is a wreck waiting to happen"
22,Playernr1,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"One of the best Call of Duty games in long time. It had kind of bad launch, but it's way better now. Can't wait for COD 2021, hopefully WW 2 !!!"
23,fullmetal3000,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"I mean it's pretty cool game, specially single player part. Multiplayer is also fun."

25,psyduuck94,"Nov 20, 2020",2,"I just refunded the game because of these reasons:1. Potentially the worst visibility in any Call of Duty game yet.2. Glitches that force you to restart your game3. Incredibly poor hit detection, especially noticeable on snipers even with stationary targets.4. Bad tickrate causing ghosting and ""shoot first, die first"" situations.5. 8 multiplayer maps, one of which is a miniature repeat of a frankly dreadful map.6. SBMM is stupidly strong"
26,Drakontas,"Nov 20, 2020",0,"Not worth its price tag by a mile.Campaign: Too short, 5 hours for the 1st playthrough, ''choices'' have very small changes on the outcome. FailedMultiplayer. Looks solid. Still garbage because it pairs you as a lv 1 with lv 30's as enemies. This doesn't get better as you advance. And that is as fun as getting teeth pulled out.Zombies: Standard CoD Zombies. Nothing groundbreaking. Conclusion: W8 for it to be discounted, then buy it if you want to."
27,TheoML,"Nov 19, 2020",2,"Should have had at least a year more in development. Feels, sounds, looks and acts as a free to play shooter. Zero incentive from the devs of fixing the game, despite it being broken for a week since release now. Campaign is dull and zombies (The 1 map we have) suffer from bugs related to crashing both PC's and Consoles, which erase all of your progress. Something as simple as equipping your calling card does not work, that should give you an idea. This is a shameless cash grab, but it has potential, and I believe it will be a good game in 6 months or so, but for now, SKIP ! On top of this, prestige is not back, despite treyarch claiming so. It is a system that works just as the seasonal level from MW."
28,TacoNeko,"Nov 20, 2020",0,"bad game, don't buy. bugs everywhere (there's this one graphical glitch that turns the background into strobe lights). all hitreg issues imported from MW2019. it's sad to see that a corporation with billions of dollars to spend is contempt with releasing games of this quality."
29,Yeon015,"Nov 20, 2020",0,"Worst Call of Duty ever. No matter how familiar it is to the console, it needs to be released in a balanced manner, which is a game for console users. Even the enemy is invisible. Treyarch is now out of development."
30,CrazyChuck,"Nov 22, 2020",0,"0/10 Refund and apology please.When I gauge a game on how fun it is, I tend to compare it to it's hookability. A good game will make you want to avoid work or school or even just destroy your life, DOTA and League players can relate.HOWEVER with Cod BOCW it is not fun here are some bits on why I and others wanted a refund:*Always online, Even the single player or solo zombies.*It's priced at 70 dollars*Very short Singleplayer.*Boring Singleplayer*Trying to milk the **** out of the corpses known as Woods and Mason (They don't even look or sound like the characters).*Hitreg in Singleplayer is bad.*Spend more time on trying to make the game woke instead of making better game code or scripts.*Bugs in Singleplayer making the game unplayable for some.*The writing and voice acting is very 'lame' or boring.*This is priced at 70 dollars.*Activation were too cheap to by the name rights to use the guns real names. They used to use the real names of weapons. Now a PP-19 is a bullfrog, Spas-12 is Gallo SA12, HK G3A3 is now Krieg 6 and so on and so forth.*The multiplayer has a dumb overlay compared to say COD MW.*Guns are so unbalanced it's insulting to us shooter fans.*Gun attachments are all pathetic that it's insulting to those who grind.*Hitreg is even worse on multiplayer. Put 6 video's of me shooting someone in the back and nothing happening on my discord, All in the same day.*Hitreg? also effects the deployable so sometimes there will just be immortal field mics around.*THIS GAME IS 70 DOLLARS.*The new mode Firestorm is weird and makes no real sense either gameplay or logical. Compare it to Plunder in COD Warzone (free btw) where you collect and deposit cash and the ones the with most cash wins, Firestorm you collect uranium and deposit it bombs then set them off making the make go smokey for a bit but you win by points... not by number of bombs made or blown up. You can win the game just by collecting uranium or setting off other peoples bombs. And the radiation doesn't even kill... THE POINT OF EXPLODING DIRTY BOMBS IS TO KILL PEOPLE, Why am I the only one that has a problem of these hippy friendly dirty bombs. And why does setting off 20 dirty bombs or more than the next squad mean victory?*Firestorm also suffers from the same problem WARZONE Plunder did with spawning parachuting enemies, You kill them but they spawn 10 seconds later over the same spot. Warzone had building to water this problem down, Land of roofs if you are getting lasered out of the sky, Or move to another building if someone keeps dropping on you.*The vehicles are something nobody wanted, likes, or finds a challenge, Like they tried to copy Battlefield in the weakest way possible, They are glass cannons, Do tons of damage but as soon as others are aware of them they die faster than you can say reload.*The TTK. Everyone is getting this one wrong. The Time To Kill is higher on paper, Weapons do less damage, People have more health... However, Headshots are instakills from just about every weapon, Shotguns are instakills from >15 meters away, The PS5 aim assist seems to lock onto peoples heads (aka instakill) Xbox aim assist seems to lock onto bodies, and PC players can all go get aids and die as far as that is concerned.*However hackers on PC made their debut 1 hour after launch, Much anti cheat, very work.*Game in both singleplayer and multiplayer feels unfinished. Even the movement feels of compared to other Cod games, Like they haven't smoothed out the mocap animations.*Zombies is fine but there is only the 1 map and it's very simple. (dead ops arcade doesn't count. We buy first person shooters to play first person shooters, Not a mobile game app. It was also better in black ops 1)*Zombies EE song is so generic it feels like it was only added because it was cheap or free.*They have made better games in the past with a smaller budget before.*THIS GAME, BY THE DARK ELDER GODS IS $70 DOLLARS. I legit had more fun vacuuming the carpet and cooking cookies than I did playing this game. That's why I say it fails at even being a game. It is just a cheap money grab at the Black Ops franchise and proves that mainstream critics are so out of touch compared to the people how actually play it for more than 30 minutes. It's not even funny bad like ""Fast & Furious Crossroads"""
31,chavanx,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"Multiplayer experience is terrible, game crashes from day 1 every 2 games. Sure, they deliver patches every 2 or 3 days but I get the feeling it's just balancing stuff and not core code solutions. I have a pretty decent pc build, I've tried everything from underclocking the gpu, delete folders, priority to exe, antivirus check and still crashes every time.Please don't buy this kind of games until they get their thing together, I suspect it's not a dev problem, more like a rush product problem as always."
32,Wralth,"Nov 23, 2020",3,"Campaign: It is fun, quite short but overall it's a good solo. 7/10 Zombies: Actually a good zombies probably a 7/10 Multiplayer: I feel like playing ranked in cs:go with the SBMM, if you don't use the super OP guns, then your opponent is way better than you (he's your average level but has a big advantage using OP weapons like the MP5). That's the worst multiplayer cod I have played so far (started at cod4). I expected to have fun but this is just a sweaty tryhard game which is not even enjoyable. 1/10 Graphism are mediocre which doesn't help... Moreover the game is really badly optimized. Unless you have an RTX 3080 to be able to run the game in ultra with RTX ON (so it looks just a bit decent) above 80 fps then the game looks crap. 1/10 Sounds are not that good 3/10 Summary: A good solo game with bad graphics. I regret wasting 70€ since I'd value this around 25 at max. Keep your money, buy something you'll actually enjoy."
33,vivang12345,"Nov 23, 2020",0,"This game is absolute garbage of a cash grab multiplayer is a **** show with everyone spamming the mp5 since it the best gun in the game and can beat any gun at any range. Not mention the new scorestreak system which is just dumb AF as now you don't need skills to get them anymore all you need to do is wait for game progression and destroy some stuff and boom you got yourself a spyplane cruise missile and other bull**** score streak. This means that once you get to mid match or near the end of a match everyone is just out here spamming their score streak like no tomorrow. They release the game for 60-70 dollars and all you get is 5 multiplayer map a shortass campaign and only 1 zombie map. Map design is also garbage with either a map favoring one side or just designed really dumb to be too big or too small with a random spawn system that trash. For 60- 70dollars this is all the content you get for a triple A game. The only good thing that this game have is zombie and even that is still **** First, it takes you more than 5-10min to find a zombie lobby and even then when you start you have a 50% chance of getting disconnected either from the game for going to long or losing connection to the host for no reason. Oh and lets not also mention the spawning and respawning of the zombie and boss zombie which can practically teleport all over the map and if you happen to miss or just stand for like 1 second to where one of the teleport location is you just get one shoted by the boss out of nowhere as they can just teleport to your location if you get too far which mind you is probably just a short run away. Oh did I mention they already have cash shop item since the game launched yep a 60-70 dollar game launching with little content wants to launch a cash shop first before content."

35,Gigaboly,"Nov 28, 2020",0,"This supposed to be the next gen cod, but probably the worst call of duty every made..First the graphics terrible, looks like an indie game on xbox360, definitely not AAA level, feels like a different game not cod. The sounds like a box, guns sounds and feels weird, attachments are the same, unfinished. Visibility is awful, very hard to spot anybody as everyone blend with environment,  movement is slow and clunky, not enough maps, terrible map design.Game is a big step back from other cod games and 10 years behind MW.The game is currently unplayable, is that bad...Campaign and zombie is good but not worth the price tag, wait for big sale..."
36,llentinantl,"Jan 31, 2021",4,"Multiplayer of Black Ops Cold War tries to mix features of Black Ops series and recent Modern Warfare reboot, and fails miserably in both directions. After getting awesome fluid gunplay of MW2019, we are receding back to plastic toys with blaster sounds and no recoil. Weapon customization is half-baked clone of MW2019, with almost every weapon having same mods in each category (sometimes not even properly displayed on weapon, such as ammo mods on Magnum), while MW2019 (and even previous game of BO series) had unique mods set for each weapon. Class system lost awesome Pick-10 approach to become clone of MW2019 class system, and failing even on that, as wildcard ruins both balance and variety. While I like progression of Black Ops more than MW2019, it is not Cold War's merit of having it, rather not losing it from previous games. Visuals are bland, with some maps having extremely ridiculous color correction.Game is out for several months, yet there are numerous bugs. It seems we came full circle, coming from BO3 tasteless ripoff of Infinite Warfare, to tasteless MW2019 ripoff of BOCW. I was never expecting to be excited about next Infinity Ward entry in series more than about Trayarch's one."

39,jelikey,"Jan  9, 2021",8,"When purchasing this game you have to realize that multiplayer isn't everything, the campaign, at least for me is one of the best in the series. However, from a multiplayer POV it is just okay. Lack of maps and those that are there are mediocre at best. I play for the campaign, but I understand that a majority of people came for zombies and multiplayer. Zombies is meh, a fun thing to play with friends, but worse than bo1 and bo2. I do in fact like this zombies but I can see how it would be a hit or miss with some people. Some people forget the launch state of Modern Warfare which was not very good, this game is better but progression is slow and there needs to be more maps added as non-dlc maps. If they give it the same treatment as Modern Warfare then I think that this could turn out to be a great game. For right now, however, keep your money and wait to see what happens."
40,TorXan,"Nov 21, 2020",0,Game Sucks.  Putting things mildly. Why did I even buy it. Quit COD a long time ago should never have come back.

42,californiatears,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"Thank you EA for this wonderful game and game series! I never cared about cod multiplayer, because there's so many of them already. I play only singleplayer and singleplayer is only reason i care about cod and that was great!"
43,daftv4der,"Nov 15, 2020",5,"Multiplayer only review. Very disappointing release. The multiplayer is extremely repetitive and shallow, the weapon balancing needs a ton of work (without attachments you're even more disadvantaged than you were in Modern Warfare), and the game runs awfully on my machine, despite having a 2080 Super and Ryzen 3600. I have to run everything on near lowest to get it to run at over 120fps. The spawns are shocking as well, often spawning me in front of enemies, or flipping multiple times in a minute, so you have no ability to form some form of map awareness. There are very few maps, and the selection of modes and maps in multiplayer are extremely limited if you leave out Zombies (which I don't play). Overall, it just feels like another rushed COD cash grab."
44,JayanWarden,"Nov 18, 2020",0,"I tried to like this game.But it really doesn't hold up in any shape or form. Singleplayer:The game tries to log into the BattleNet Servers even when they are down and you click ""Play offline"".That results in not being able to play the campaign when you have no internet or the servers are down. Which they are often.The campaign is *very* short. The writing and voice acting is insulting for a AAA title. Worst campaign of any CoD so far, in my opinion. Multiplayer:Infinity Ward wants you to stay at a 1.0 K/D ratio at all times. Which is why ""skill based matchmaking"" is the norm now and can't be toggled off.Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike SBMM, especially coming from games like CS:GO. But you don't even have the option to turn it off, just like in CoD:MW 2019.This results in every round being super sweaty. You can't turn on the game to enjoy a chill multiplayer round where you can goof around. Everyone needs to tryhard, because they get matched with people with the same skill.This results in people sitting in corners, waiting for you to run by, amplified by weapon and map design. There are corners and places in every map where campers get the upper foot, basically only dying when they miss their shots. Same with chokeholds on all current maps. It is incredibly easy to spawncamp, especially in hardcore where you die when you get shot in your pinkie. I am now prestige 1 level 45, but I can't really recommend the game."

An Mp5 nerv and promisses for a better SEASON PASS. *gib more money pls*  Hundrets of players with the same Error Codes like me and still no answer from support. 235092950 Workarounds that don´t work.

48,Sleezy,"Nov 18, 2020",1,"What a lazy wack ass game. You can tell they shat out this game just to make some yummy yummy fast money. It’s **** trash. The maps are **** donkey dick. And to give it a good ol yanky doodle surprise you never know where the **** you’re gonna spawn. You could spawn right into the enemy team where you’ll get **** harassed by the mp5 (don’t think this is the last time you’ll hear about the mp5). But the maps are just lazy and boring. Nothing good about them. Just a bunch of corners to run to where you’ll find an enemy waiting with their **** heal needle and a god damn mp5. Now the mp5 is just the **** best god damn gun in any game. It’s a **** multigun. The damn thing is good from all distances, it’s your shotgun, fully automatic, and sniper. The damn thing is **** straight up blessed by the **** gods. And sure but cod always has issues day one. When you have been having the same issues for years and still can’t get a good day one release it’s clear they are not trying. They are just **** beating the god damn life out of this horse bro. And you think maybe just maybe I can look past this and have fun. Just maybe..... nah mother ****er good luck even trying to get into a game. You’ll find one and then just **** get kicked or people in your party will just get **** yeeted out for no reason. But what do you expect? These ****ers have just been making the same **** games for years don’t you ever expect a good fun balanced experience day one. And have fun with the constant random crashes. For some reason it just happens. It’s that god damn crisp cod experience baby. God **** damn. The zombies bland as **** The story probably pretty alright. It has some good stuff but the amount of poo ass pissy butt **** going on just overweights the good. It’s hard to enjoy the game when you have the mp5 out performing every other gun in the game. I’m no **** game review pro but when I’d rather beat my dick for the 10th time than play this trash we have a problem. Lazy out the god damn boom shoot. Just so much **** stinky ass lazy poo. **** lazy poo. God damn lazy."

The amount of Bugs is not even Funny anymore, it's just sad to see such an unfinished Product release. Overall The Gunplay is goodMovement feels fine, could be faster for meWeapons Level too slow Multiplayer Weapons balance is badSkill based Matchmaking ruins the Fun and makes me not want to play with my FriendsThe Hit Reg is actually decent when Compared to other CoDs When u like Mw there is no Reason to buy this Game for the Multiplayer Zombies Zombies is Great like always, a good Map, grinding Weapons to Gold is Fun and we get new Maps for Free, if u want this Game for Zombies buy it Normally I would give this Game a 5 becuase half of the Game is good, but because the Developers are lying like way too many times about how they are listening to the community and then never even react once too the Hate that Skill Based Matchmaking gets is just sad and there are other Points where they are just telling Marketing lies and the exclusiv Playstation Content is also not cool, because of that I give it a 0 cause I feel personally insulted when someone lies straight to my Face."

Take it from me, a jackass who's played every COD in the last 12 years and managed to find some fun in each of them. There's like 7 new maps (8 if you include Nuketown) a small pool of weapons and one zombie map as well as the campaign which I didn't download. Maybe I'd be more forgiving if the game was absolute eye candy but it just looks like another COD game with like a third or or even closer to half the content you'd expect. My friends asked me if it's worth getting and although playing with friends is more fun I urged them not to get it. I'm glad this game is as bad as it is, now I can finally be done with the series like for good. It's been fun but time to move on."

57,JesterDEWIT,"Nov 14, 2020",3,"Call of duty: Black ops cold war takes the old and adds new, unlike black ops 4 where that game took the old that worked that people liked and replaced it for the sake of making something brand new, I'm mostly referring to the zombies in that case, but this game takes the old that fans liked about Black Ops series and adds new to that, without removing the old. As it goes for the Cold War theme and the story.I really want to sit down and ask few questions to the people who made the story, ask them things like what they were going for and what message, are they trying to put out if any. I get a few hints in mind. And if it's true I think it's really bad for this game series. The multiplayer can be fun while keeping with the games theme and even giving you an introductory cutscene just it starting up to add to the set theme, but particularly in the multiplayer I don't like the animations in this game. I don't know if it's because I've been spoiled with the motion capture from on MW and there feel for realistic lookingbut fast gameplay they went for. But if I go play Black Ops 3 zombies for some reason I like the animations better. I have a theory that it cold war uses the game engine from Black Ops 4, and I didn't like how that game felt, and a lot of people didn't, as I've heard. As I was playing through the campaign i was thinking about this the whole time but didn't want to admit it but I'm going to admit it.... The reason why they called Black ops and why Hudson woods and Mason are in the game.. they pulled a Disney...you know like other new Star wars movie had all the old characters in it but they were not themselves and we're not involved in the main plot? Basically what they did it feels it me... Little throwbacks here and there but they pulled a Disney it feels like..... Maybe that's why they didn't cast the original voice actor for woods, he probably would have been pissed off like mark hamill was with Luke in The last Jedi. Look... nostalgia....is a good powerful, almost like a drug for the brain, and it helps give a happy feeling, a lot of people loved the original characters and there were bits of them in Black Ops 4, but it seemed like there was a trick for using nostalgia in a way to buy the characters, or the game. what I'm saying is like I tried to explain earlier I feel like they made a ""Disney clickbait"". If the original crew were not teased in the trailers in this game then not called Black Ops. I don't think it wouldn't have been as popular and I don't think much people would have bought it if it wasn't for them being in the game. They're nothing like themselves, of course they may not sound like them, but from what I know they could have got woods his voice actor easily but they didn't, and for some reason they got a guy who sounds like he's trying to sound like the previous voice actor.... why? I understand that their previous title did not go so well (Black Ops 4). But to bring back, beloved characters from the dead, so to speak, just to have the nostalgia feeling kickin so people would buy your game, then for them to be completely different. Why would you do that?I know people would complain to me and say that's what the new modern warfare did but the new modern warfare reimagined the whole Modern Warfare trilogy, but in modern times. This game, tried to put itself between black ops 1 and 2 story.. But they treated their characters like if they reimagined them? they added bits and histologia to keep you going, there's multiple endings and there's one that makes me question what's the point of this games story? Matter of fact, I think they all do that, and the thing with these Call of Duty games. The theme is the story, and the setting, and if the story is good. The rest of the game feels and looks good. If the theme is trash. The rest of it all falls apart (zombies and multiplayer). To be brutally honest, I'm upset that they didn't try to get james C. Burns To play Woods again, as they did before. It makes sense if you were reimagining the story like Modern Warfare but they didn't, I want to know the truth of why they did not try to get him. Imagine how you made James feel, how you made the fans feel. I've seen a bunch of clips on YouTube of him acting, a bunch of interviews, and that's woods right there. you can't put the body of his character in people's views for nostalgia to get them to buy your game. Maybe that's not what they did. I don't know but that's how I feel and I feel horrible... I feel worse Wondering how James feels. Short summary there is fun to be had with this game, especially the zombies.But the theme for both multiplayer, and zombies the bad story and it makes the rest of the experience feel bad. Just like it would in any other Call of Duty game. Not trying to be a hater but this this reminds me of black ops 4, sometimes beloved characters should be put to rest instead of brought out of their grave and treated like this. Master Chief is a great example"
58,TomasLacerda,"Nov 14, 2020",1,"The game is insulting. I already asked for a refund on this.The game is awful. Gameplay, AI, it's just insulting how bad it is.

59,Betrayal,"Nov 14, 2020",2,"Glad I was not hyped for this game, seems to have been another let down, after a successful release of Modern warfare 2019, Cold war has fallen short...a few things I am unhappy with, in no particular order: Missing features ( such as mounting weapons on surfaces and tactical sprint )Unrealistic movement.Multiplayer weapons are broken ( Usually I understand this when a new COD releases but I honestly hate all the weapons in this game )Spawn locations/Spawn switching ( Constantly having to turn around on smaller maps as the spawns are constantly switching making it very difficult to even know which direction to go, I seem to keep having an enemy in front of me and behind I have no clear direction in which the enemy is coming from, this will lead to most people camping )Maps seem bland and boringSever connection has been terrible ( Understandable with a new release of COD this has happened plenty of times in the past, but still annoying when you either get kicked and/or having to wait in the lobby to find a game for about 15 mins )Since new patch game keeps crashing (This is the biggest issue I have so far with the game, I have stopped playing multiplayer as i find it no fun so the little fun i do find is within the zombies game mode but even so after waiting for about 15 mins to find a game...it crashes )Graphics are good ( I wouldn't say they are better than MW 2019 but I have to admit on PC with Ultra settings the game looks great, Campaign is where it really showed, during cut scenes and action sequences, I've heard on console the graphics are not great  )Campaign is lackluster ( I always play campaign before anything as I can usually tell if the game will be decent or not and to be honest it was good, but it felt short and predictable, this will not be a campaign we will talk about in the future like previous COD titles ) This is just a short list of the things I've noted, I'm sure when I can play the game again without it crashing ill be able to find a few more things to add. This game feels like its missing things and its a shame as we were all expecting another MW 2019 but its no where near as good or as innovative, after having black ops 4 I was hoping it was going to be a change for the Black ops franchise but again its another disappointment but at least they have a campaign. On a positive note Zombies is great, it feels like black ops and black ops 2 zombies with a couple changes, currently only one map but it has a lot of nostalgia for OG COD zombie players. They have also brought back Zombies Arcade which is just as great as the original one, I think Zombies was the only reason I did not score this game any lower, Its the only decent thing I can really say about the game."

61,Ammonium,"Nov 15, 2020",3,"The campaign is ok but like always it's Russian bad and USA good but wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it especially when the core of every CoD the Multiplayer is and they seriously **** it up. The Gameplay itself is fun but to start with just 8 maps at the release while Modern Warfare had 20 is not good. I only play the entire time the same 3 maps and it get's boring really fast and i have now around 15 hours of Multiplayer playtime also it took 5 hours for example until i got Moscow into my map rotation and only played it now 5 times in 15 hours. Then the zombies mode...I love zombies but that it's player hostet without server is a big no in 2020 in my opinion. Also when the host has a crash and the game does host migration the entire lobby crashes too in 8 out of 10 times. Just Unacceptable.And the problems with crashes also the server performance is so bad that the TTK feels often like MW. And i wouldn't recommend to buy the game at full price to anyone. The Game is unacceptable for 60/80 euro it feels like an early access game. Then the Camos look bad muddy and are just copy pasted from BO2 without optimization. Also the exp to lvl your weapon / grind attachments are so low that it takes forever to get them. And the standard multiplayer Operator need to be unlocked through missions, It's as if they put all that **** grind into the game so that you overlook it's serious lack of content. Then the Map visibility is just bad and enemys blend too much into the enviroment often and Cold War itself feels really like i bought a 60 euro Early Game... It's so ridiculous i feel ripped off so hard. And when someone comes and thinks ""But it just released a few days ago"" First of all you are the reason that Activision released that **** You also don't go to your stylist and pays him 50$ and he just cuts 5 strands of hair. Like i said i really feel ripped off and i only bought it because i liked the ""Beta"" (Which in fact was not a **** Beta) and i really really regret buying it. So please don't make the same mistake."
62,PDog44,"Nov 14, 2020",3,"If you thought you were going to get a better COD multiplayer experience then MW You're sadly mistaken. Another COD that will kill your computer if you don't have good specs and another COD that has the MP5 as the king over all guns. You play multiplayer and watch the killfeed and it seems to be nothing but MP5's and instead of a shotgun sniping you across the map like in MW it is now a M16. I was inlove with the older COD games but wow, these recent games can really leave a sour taste in your mouth. Instead of the 1 second gunfights you get in MW you now have the participation award killstreaks. I find nothing but MP5 in games. there is no diversity in weapons. its almost like the ""nerf"" the MP5 got didn't happen. its still the only weapon that is used in multiplayer and there is no more of those sniper battles you have with players and no more of those medium ranged AR battles.... its just some kid running around with an mp5 laser sight and stims. tired of this. I really wish i could've gotten my money."
63,Death_Hawk,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"DO NOT BUY THE PC VERSION, IT'S AN UNSTABLE, BUGGY MESS, CANNOT RUN ABOVE 30FPS ON ANY SYSTEM. Multiplayer/Zombies Review:Multiplayer is a complete step backwards from modern warfare, less maps, less modes, less features. While it's generic COD in its implementation, it fails in every aspect. The guns look and sound worse than in modern warfare. The devs spent so long with pointless reflections and water effects that they forgot they were making a game. Zombies is quite possibly the best it's been since black ops 1. The reimagined nacht is fun, I look forward to where they decide to take it. You'd think with this mediocrity, the game would get a 5/10, but with the complete lack of optimisation, this game is clearly a cheap cash grab. Since the game is unplayable in its current state, I cannot rate it any higher than 0 since the core function of a game is to run."

70,azgoodaz,"Nov 18, 2020",3,"Let's start off by saying a CoD game with 25% of the content locked behind a platform will never get a 10/10. I paid $59.99 on the Battlenet Launcher for the PC version and I felt like this game was worth $49.99 for how much content is in this game, that's how much it should have been. Cold War is a scam. Campaign is Mason (the player from past Black Ops games) and now the character you played as for some parts of the campaign... he doesn't even talk. You have to choose pre-selected prompts and then the other characters speak. Kinda disappointing for a $60 - 70 game. Zombies is fun but a lot of things from multiplayer and Warzone, it's ugly. Easter Eggs have been figured out in less than 24 hours of release... Very well thought out Easter Eggs (sarcasm), Black Ops 1 and 2 had better Easter Eggs than this garbage. Warzone is fun but it still implements that horrible armor system where you have to micro-manage your armor. It would be nice if we had a Hardcore Warzone where Armor doesn't exists. Make it more fast pace. Multiplayer has limited game modes, nothing like Modern Warfare, not very unique game modes either. Most game modes are just modes from Battlefield. Gameplay feels washy and floaty, feels like my weapons are all over the place compared to Modern Warfare. Hardcore got the ugly duckling treatment yet again, Core as more modes than Hardcore. Multiplayer has only 8 maps compared to older Black Ops titles that had 12 - 14 maps at launch. Weapons are pretty limited and somehow a Game Designer though to put 'Ghost, Ninja and Cold Blooded' all on Perk 3. What's the point of this? Pros:- Campaign- Theater Mode Cons:- Overpriced for locked content and items- Nuketown is getting remade again.- 8 maps.- Limited game modes- Hardcore got ugly treatment- No Operator customization, everything is in Battle Passes. This isn't a game where if you have $60, you want to buy this. I personally would just buy Modern Warfare if you really have the money, just wait when that game goes on sale. For being 3 years in development for this game, this feels very early access. It doesn't feel finished and it doesn't feel or look like a $60 game nor a $70 game on consoles. You can tell the development doesn't care anymore. CoD is just a cash grab, this game is just a scam, a really good scam."

The gunplay is bad, the sounds are the worst I've ever heard in a Call of Duty game. Sprinting or running feels terrible. You can't mount weapons, you can't cancel reload, as of February 2021 the game still feels bad in a i7-10th Gen and RTX2070 SUPER, the maps are really bad, you can't change teams in the lobby or have them automatically assigned (private matches), there are no dedicated servers, only 3 LMG's and 3 Snipers, and the overall experience feels a lot worse than Modern Warfare.

82,imBuffnstuff,"Nov 18, 2020",2,trying to integrate this with Warzone was just dumb. Feels downgraded. Movement feels sluggish. Like a bunch of 5th grade developers made the game. Sound design is beyond awful. Looks more like it was built for a mobile experience. They are just beyond lazy.  Save your money on this one.

What can you even say to something like that. It is beyond me how someone can say this is a finished game. This is yet another example of a game being pushed out before it is remotely close to being finished. it crashes on all consoles, but is by far worst on PC. Stear clear of this absolute trash game. I wouldn't even call it a game. More like a crash simulator.A solid 0 out of 10 seeing as it is literally unplayable."
84,Tombiest,"Nov 19, 2020",0,"This has to be the most broken game I have ever played. period. I legit can not believe that i spent more than $5 on this game let alone $60. the guns just seem to kill at a random amount of shots, that is if you go longer than 5 minutes without the game shutting your pc off. there are only about 5 maps, 6 if you include the zombies map, and less than 30 guns throughout the entire game that take at least 10 hours to level up one to level 10.I'd say the campaign is worth it but its deleted my save all 4 times I have tried to get through it. Zombies is the games only saving grace but if you've made it to round 20, you've already seen everything it has to offer. I'd recommend saving your money or buying modern warfare, its what I wish I had done. I have never kicked myself in the ass for buying a game more than I have with this one."

89,Gojiraaa,"Nov 18, 2020",0,"This game is hot garbage but it's no surprise considering Activision's  track record. The game was clearly rushed, lacks content, full of hitreg issues, server issues, bugs, and worst of all plagued with cheaters. It's is clear that this game was rushed and incomplete. Even the graphical fidelity is extremely subpar. The colors are so washed out and the textures are bland. This makes it increasingly difficult to spot enemies. The gameplay is pretty mediocre and blocky. Less content then other COD releases, less maps, less weapons, etc. They even favor PlayStation by giving them XP boosts, game modes, and other benefits only available to PlayStation players that XBOX and PC don't get. You're playing at an inherent disadvantage if you play on Xbox or PC, on-top of all the other glaring issues that will plague your experience. And don't even get me started on how strong the aim-assist is, if you play on PC prepare to be melted by low-talent players who's game plays itself for them. You would do yourself a huge favor by skipping this terrible game. I wish I could give it a -10 honestly. Zombies might add a little bit of value but I'm not a zombies guy so that doesn't really factor into my review. Couldn't hit the refund button fast enough on this steaming pile."

92,jestifizzle,"Nov 20, 2020",4,"I think the reviews of 0 are just review bombing so here's an honest review. The game plays and feels like a pre-alpha. Core fps mechanics are completely broken and inconsistent: Mouse & keyboard aim feels unnatrual, controller aim assist was reworked (and made a lot worse) for some bizarre reason, ignoring the fact that they have had a good, working aim assist for the last decade. THIS GAME HAS SBMM! And it is enforced visciously with the lack of any ranked mode. Visuals are worse than modern warfare 2019 despite sharing the same engine. All this without even getting to the multiple bugs and crashes especially on PC. The game is currently not fun to play in the slightest, and probably the biggest problem of all (which is borderliine criminal) from the development team and publisher is the fact that the game costs $70 for something that feels like an independent work in very early pre-alpha phases of development. Zombies in the only reason worth getting this game however that too contains multiple game breaking bugs. As far as I'm concerned, blaming the tough year of 2020 doesn't excuse the poor product that they have delivered to us. I would go so far as to say that this is a scam product overhyped by marketing and that the publusher and game title should be boycotted."
93,Jonnyblackjack,"Nov 18, 2020",3,"I’ve played call of duty games my whole life growing up. Modern Warfare to Cold War. This is the least satisfying call of duty game I have ever played. The content is not there. Prestige tokens that have no shop on launch, only 6 6v6 maps on launch, weapons level slower than actual player levels. Where are the zombies maps? Where are the secondary weapons? Where are the 12v12 maps? To be quite frank, Warzone integration should have been in the game AT LAUNCH. NOT 4-6 weeks after the launch of the game!!! The campaign is great! The one zombies map is pretty good! The multiplayer is a disaster. I have prestiged once in this game so far and I have been using two primary weapons being the XM4 and the MP5. Neither of those two guns I used almost exclusively are max weapon level. There is a clear artificial barrier placed on the speed of gun leveling in this game. Normally that would be okay but attachments are VITAL in this particular game. They decrease the recoil and damage range of weapons drastically. The bottom line is that this game was not finished and it was not ready to be released this month. My score reflects the content in this game compared to previous titles and also the initial launch experience as a long-time player. I am willing to bring this score up next month depending on what kind of changes and new content they bring to the table but for a launch of a CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS game this is disgraceful. Any semblance of nostalgia that I had from previous black ops titles is withered and dead. This is NOT a black ops game. It’s the first cod game that within the first week of launch I can’t bring myself to play because of sweaty sbmm multiplayer lobbies with slow progression and one zombies map. But hey the campaign is pretty damn good."
94,TheMessenger,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"Just cause Playstation 4 / 5 version are bad (because weak loser console), doesn't mean you have to troll PC / Xbox Series X versions that run on ultimately superior hardware."
95,awesomekratos12,"Apr 27, 2021",4,"This is the most boring cod released by far. This game feels like Black Ops 1 but with slightly better gunplay. While Black Ops 1 was good for it's time, fps games have evolved quite a bit since 2010, but this game just feels like a huge downgrade from MW 2019. The gunplay is worse and more clunky, the graphics are average at best, back to small, claustrophobic maps that cod has always been known for, and it's all the worse for it. The only strong point of the game is the zombies mode since they've at least tried to somewhat innovate on that front. You have a new outbreak mode which is basically a series of open world maps where you complete objectives to progress to the next map, each time you reach a new map the difficulty gets harder and harder. But this is the only good thing about the game. The campaign is utterly forgettable and boring, and the multiplayer as I have said before plays almost exactly like Black Ops 1 from over a decade ago. How did we go from a relatively solid CoD in 2019, to a massively gimped CoD in 2020/2021? Save your money and play something like R6 Siege instead. If they sold the zombies mode separately, this games multiplayer would be more dead than it already is,"
96,cr3d,"Jun  1, 2021",8,"This game in my honest opinion, as a cod veteran who has been playing the franchise on and off for 9 years, it is very over-hated. The biggest downfall of this game is some of the silly decisions Activision/developers have made revolving the multiplayer. two massive ones that are the real issue for the vast majority of us is the strict SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) and the fact that lobbies with randoms disband at the end of each game... the sbmm makes the game very competitive because you are being hammered to your skill ceiling 24/7, basically you can never catch a break! and the lobbies disbanding is just a sad reality, i have so many happy memories of trolling people and having a laugh and even making real friendships within matchmaking, but now you have to friend people and it ruins the experience, before you could all just chill and not leave the lobby and talk to a bunch of strangers, not anymore! with the negatives all said and done, zombies, campaign and multiplayer are all strong contenders this year, the zombies being a little easy but other than that, the 'trifecta' which makes Treyarch so great is true and strong in this call of duty title. Amazing campaign which i will play again when i have forgotten the plot in a year or so. the mp content, maps and gun play are really good. TLDR: That is all I have time for, a rather short review but it says all you need to know really. If you don't like being competetive, this game is not for you, even party games and jokey game modes are turned into a cesspool of CDL skins and sweaty gfuel-drinking cheese heads that use the most op create a classes. 8/10"
97,tdebug,"Nov 16, 2020",3,"Campaign is nice but very, very short. Literally can finish it all in 2 evenings, doing all possible optional missions. Not sure it worth the asking price to be honest. So it's 4 points max for 60€ it is not enough of gameplay. Zombie part is completely pointless, idea-free, messed up running and shooting. 0 points for this."
98,Tsyuko,"Nov 18, 2020",2,"My whole review is only about MP, I never play anything else in CoD... As 6v6 MP only player I considered MW 2019 absolutely the worst CoD ever created. It had terrible maps with too many angles, terrible doors, infinite claymores with restock, no dead silence perk, TTK too fast, camping spots(even remastered maps were ruined with them), strong SBMM in casual playlist, washed out graphics etc. It was the only CoD ever I almost refunded. It was like game itself decided if I kill or die. The last thing I ever wanted from CoD series is realism - the only reason I buy CoD is that it's casual fast paced arcady shooter,  so I consider Cold War being huge improvement(to me every single CoD is masterpiece compared to last year MW). It's fast paced, maps are better(but not perfect), perks are more balanced, TTK is little bit slower(but still quite fast), there is just 1 land mine with long CD, game actually has some colors, camping is not the only way to play and it can be countered. It's CoD again and not Insurgency clone made for CoD haters and realism seekers. First 10 hours I had flawless experience - it reminded me times of BO1 and BO2 which are my most favorite CoD games. I wanted to go for 8+ rating but then thick skill based matchmaking kicked in and it ruined my experience with game little bit(and little bit more). Hard campers and sweats started to often fill my lobbies again(but at least whole game is not designed only for them). There should be casual playlist with weak or none SBMM and ranked with this kind of SBMM with ranks and extra rewards. Also on some maps there are flashing textures(sand on Satelite, mountains on Cartel). This was not happening on beta. There are also small bugs here and there like unlockable calling cards are not saved when you pick them. Another problem is lack of 6v6 maps on release so for now its like 6.5/10 for me untill everything is fixed. After that and when they add more maps it would be like 7.5/10. If they add also ranked and nerf SBMM in casual playlist I would go even for 8.5/10 easily. No performance problems at all on my side, runs exactly as MW (i7-7700k+1080Ti), 80-100 fps 1440p maxed out(tested MP only) EDIT: Changed rating from 7 to 2 just because of SBMM... It's not objective but I just can't do this anymore. I like game itself in general (much more than MW) but I absolutely refuse to sweat each and every single game to my maximum potential just to keep 1,2+ k/d in CASUAL playlist. I am not ranked player in any game - I HATE e-sport and ranked tryhard-meta trend, only reason I was playing COD was because it's casual MP game and it's not anymore. Game offers absolutely no choice in this matter, no ranked vs quick match playlist, there is only ranked without rank. Burn in hell for ruining this casual MP series and otherwise good game with system like this. I hope at least Battlefield will never give up on completly random server list system... I always liked COD more but this is just unbearable. Game itself decide who and when will do well or terrible in each match, not player skill. You had 2 good matches? Bad for you, next 2 you will be annihilated... You suck in 2 matches? Well, here is your candy - you will be rewarded with some easy game next. This is not even multiplayer, it's just singleplayer with adaptive difficulty with players carefully picked instead of bots."
99,Navax,"Nov 20, 2020",5,"Ok I was so hyped for this game but activision hella sure knows how to **** a game. Where do I start? How do I even begin to describe this thing?! Well let's talk positives first the new graphics looks awesome, even compared to modern warfare this is a huge step up, the campaign is pretty great but way too short and why didn't they bring original woods and mason actors? And as the last positive thing zombies are decent remind me a lot to bo1 with dead ops arcade returning being a super entretaining  mode improving upon bo1 and 3 in my opinion and the style of the game is beautiful, it seems really artistic. So there is all the positive stuff as a single player expierience, I'd say black ops Cold War is a solid 8.5/10 but there is a negative in single player, WHY TF DO I HAVE TO LEAVE MY CAMPAIGN OR ZOMBIES SOLO GAME IN ORDER TO PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT INPUT? What the hell treyarch? There is not even a match making going on if that is the excuse. So as you probably already notice, my huge problem with this game is the multiplayer and luckly they can be fixed but this is, and I'm dead serious , the worst CoD mp experience I've had past WWII. First off, the game only jas 8 maps so it's the second fewest amount that a CoD has had only surpassed by WWII, second the game has only 9 modes (those are pretty great btw major props) but where's gun game? Infected? CTF? Gunfight was promised to make it's return in this game but that's not the only unacomplished promise, Treyarch explicitly said they weren't going to put sbmm in this game and I have ran into sweaty people like no tomorrow, also in the beta lobbies didnt separate after the match so why does it happen now can I know? The connection and the performance of the game are worse than in the beta I lag so hard and the game have stuttering (even on the campaign and zombies), I change the graphics to low and still happens with a 2060 and I guess u can argue its not the most powerful card out there and that sbmm makes connection worse but why is it worse than the beta? Also hit detection is awful and worse than beta. The mp it self has decent maps great class customization and it's good overall but broken by sbmm, horrible weapon balance (evryone runs the freakin xm4), connection issues and awful hit detection. In conclusion, unless you're really thrilled to play a campaign set in the cold war with iconic characters like Mason, Hudson, Weaver and Woods, I'd say don't waste your 60 dollars YET cause as I said, this problems with the mp can be fixed and zombies and story are awesome. Update the more I played it the more cancer I got. This is the worst CoD MP ever made and Im being generous giving it a 5"

However, from a multiplayer POV it is just okay. Lack of maps and those that are there are mediocre at best. I play for the campaign, but I understand that a majority of people came for zombies and multiplayer. Zombies is meh, a fun thing to play with friends, but worse than bo1 and bo2. I do in fact like this zombies but I can see how it would be a hit or miss with some people. Some people forget the launch state of Modern Warfare which was not very good, this game is better but progression is slow and there needs to be more maps added as non-dlc maps. If they give it the same treatment as Modern Warfare then I think that this could turn out to be a great game. For right now, however, keep your money and wait to see what happens."

The PC-Port is awfully optimized, if you bought a raytracing GPU you dont even have to think about activating raytracing in this game, doesnt change much and reduces the FPS by about 20-30.Bad tickrate, so ""SHOOT FIRST, DIE FIRST"" is very common but shouldnt be a thing at all.Bad visibility, 60% of the time you dont even see where your bullets are going and you just guess that you are hitting the enemy.Glitches so bad that I cant even play zombies with my friends because every game someone's game crashes MULTIPLE times.Poor weapon balancing, the MP5 is able to kill you from short, medium and long ranges with about 3 hits, doesnt matter where as long as its not the toes. This game had a beta on every console it released and its evident they didnt change a thing when it comes to weapon balancing, this would be fixed in a day but well its still in there and practically EVERYONE is playing MP5.Multiplayer was fun the first few matches but afterwards it just was draining and me and all of my friends couldnt play this game anymore. After some time you just feel like you shouldnt engage the enemy because you will be killed immediately by his mp5, so whats the point ? This game couldve been made in two weeks when it comes to the IMMENSE amount of bugs there are. Its mindblowing.Dont buy it. Just dont."

The guns sound like plastic. The movement makes everyone look like they're wearing heelys. The fact that they used an old engine for a 2020 game is beyond me. You can already tell this game was a complete money grab and that little to no effort was put in. And to charge a premium price tag on top of that is absurd.

Guns are not balanced and the time to kill does feel consistent. Gone are killstreaks and back are scorestreaks that reward every player, even for doing poorly. The servers are terrible, and the game feels like a huge downgrade from MW.

Could you please try the following to see if it will help: -Could you move the Cold War application away from the Modern Warfare folder-Clear Cache: https://bit.ly/3nUriYP -Reboot system – unplug system for 5 mins-Ensure drivers are up to date-Scan & Repair https://blizz.ly/341qoSe-Update OS Could you please also let me know: -ATVI ID-Battletag-Did any images/error message occur if so can you provide me a photo? Please let me know if any of this has helped :-). ^RZ To make this short, I- Updated everything on my PC, Chipset, GPU etc-No OC software running in the background-Deleted and reinstalled the game twice (I even deleetd blizzard apps and left over files with revo uninstaller).-Removed COD MW plus Warzone (note, I didn't ever have one issue with this game). So Support got back to me to ask me to upload some info on my computer like the normal Dxdiag, but also wanted me to upload all of this data to a site called ""Pastebin"". I had to first copy the data to a notepad than paste it to this site and get the URL and link it in this message on twitter. The next part I had to go to the install location of Cold War and hit the ""ReportCodBug.exe"". It created a folder with a bunch of error files inside it. Inside this folder was 10 folders (all zipped) with each folder having 6 files. So in total 60+ files. The Twitter support wanted me to open each folder, copy all of the date to a notepad, link it to this pastebin site then give them a link to each. I'm not even joking. They really wanted me to do this. @ATVIAssist -Could you go throw each and throw them in a pastebin link please? Sorry for the confusion. ^RZ I uploaded my Dxdiag and linked this report folder yet no one has replied back. It's been days now. No one from the support and even looked at my replies of these urls with the data. They simply don't care.
If I known this game was this buggy, I would have never bought this. If the game wasn't buggy, I would rate it, but can't because I can't play lol"

115,Aurelien2000,"Nov 22, 2020",1,"Franchement c'est dans l'ensemble une catastrophe à l'heure actuelle. Déjà je précise que je ne joue pas à la campagne donc je ne prendrais pas cet aspect du jeu en considération.Bon alors pour ce qui est du multi tout d'abord c'est très trèèès pauvre en contenu. Seulement deux vraies nouvelles maps 6v6 en plus d la bêta et aucunes nouvelles maps 12v12 ! Aucune innovation c'est du vu et revu dans l'ensemble... Les spawns sont trop frustrants et pensés pour des victimes, combinés à un système de score based matchmaking qui gâche totalement l'expérience de jeu pour un joueur expérimenté comme moi. Les streaks sont cools mais mais très peu 'nombreux malheureusement. C' est très clairement l'un des pires multi que j'ai jamais vu et pourtant je joue à cod depuis longtemps. Même si le plus gros problème reste largement le sbmm il y a aussi les bugs qui sont multiples et assurent des parties très énervantes. Exemple :je suis dans un bâtiment et je meurt par un tir d'artillerie qui tombe dehors tout à fait inédit xDIl y a également l'invincibilité au respawn face aux streaks qui empêche de faire des carnages, les armes totalement déséquilibrées comme la mp5 ou les mitraillettes de façon générale qui tuent en une balle même de loin allez comprendre, ou encore le système ""d'équilibrage"" des équipes qui fait que je ne peux enchaîner indéfiniment les victoires parce qu'au bout de 3-4 games le jeu va m'obliger à me coltiner des types qui en rien à faire de l'objectif allez comprendre pourquoi. Dernier point et pas des moindres il n'y a qu'une seule map à peu prêt amusante et nerveuse c'est cartel en 12v12. Sauf que de ce fait ça oblige à tout le temps ralancer pour tomber dessus :(Bref rien de plaisant que de la frustration, on en ressort plus tendu que détendu !Sinon pour ce qui est du zombie il est vraiment sympa mais les bugs de co gâchent tout. La grande majorité des games crashent parce que l'hôte quitte la partie, qu'il y a une maj des serveurs, ou que le logo câble ethernet de 2010 apparaît xDC'est infernal et pourtant je précise que j'ai la fibre donc je ne comprend pas pourquoi le jeu ne me fait pas héberger la partie ou pourquoi ils n'y a toujours pas de serveurs dédiés dans ce mode de jeu. J'espère que ce sera vite corrigé mais c'est tout de même une honte de sortir un mode de jeu dans un tel état. Enfin je joue sur pc et j'ai de gros problèmes d'optimisation alors que sur le précédent opus le jeu tournait parfaitement en full élevé. J'ai vérifié sur internet et aparament je suis loin d'être le seul dans ce cas là donc bon à moins que ce soit corrigé très rapidement ça veut dire que même sur ce point là il n'y a rien à en tirer."

Have fun with the new COD, featuring quick scoopers, wall hackers, and trash, but don't worry! New and improved non-binary choices, give me a **** break. Don't buy this absolute trash of a game."
118,Shoulderknight,"Nov 23, 2020",0,"This game is pure utter trash. I tried very hard to like this game. Played the Multi-Player for 15 hours or so. The imbalance is insane. The only response from devs is to Nerf something. You can go 37-14 in one game and in the next you're guaranteed to fight for your life to break even due to its BS SBMM. Don't even consider leveling a new gun. In pretty much any MP game you can stand your own with no attachments. But in this one, you are so hamstrung and have to claw your way slowly to level your gun with decent attachments to be somewhat competitive.  Half the maps are garbage and the other half-decent. And the kicker is there are barely any maps. This game is so broken, so not fun, and incredibly stressful. Skip this one and save your hard-earned cash. Shame on you Sledgehammer and Treyarch. Get your act together and fix this filth."
119,Cookiebooky,"Nov 19, 2020",3,"The worst CoD I have ever played. Only redeeming quality is the campaign. Multiplayer and Zombies are a joke. In multiplayer it feels like you are firing bb guns. There are no weight to the guns and they all sound the same. Grenades feels like you are throwing a rubber duck. Death animations are super bad. Actually the animations in general are ass. Maps feels like they were designed by a 12 year old. Where CoD MW innovated in a lot of ways, this seems like a huge setup, almost feels like a chinese F2P game, but even some of those are good. TTK seems super **** and hitreg is over there."
120,Pixel_Fuzz,"Nov 19, 2020",2,"Maybe it's Activision fault or Treyarch, I don't know, but the game is not enjoyable at ALL! It feels rushed and unfinished. Gunfight it's a coin flip. First shoot - first die. The movement it awful.  And final the SBMM (Skill Based Matchmaking) gives me nightmares. It put casual players against pros... Brilliant."
121,Umoon,"Nov 19, 2020",0,Как можно оценивать игру от 0 до 10. добавить пару баллов чисто за работу большого коллектива ? Я потратил деньги на это говно. А с другой стороны мне втюхали очень некачественный продукт. Сюжет короткий. Графика в этой игре - это назад на несколько лет.Эта игра не достойна титула AAA. Иначе нас просто обманули. Очень жаль что весь мир катится в сторону количества а не качества. Это последняя игра Call of Duty которую я купил. Особенно обидно что разработчики сделали моей любимой игрой Black Ops 4 затмение на PC. А после этого два года подряд мне продают полное говно.

124,N0NNY,"Nov 22, 2020",0,"I’ve been a long time fan of call of duty and modern warefare was a disappointment but this game just reaches to the low of the low of modern warefare 2019 it is so bad I regret buying it every single day I play it the game crashing bugs are everywhere so you can’t even play it for that long. Hit detection is so bad in this game it’s like there isn’t any. You can’t see the enemy team cause the visibility of players is so damn bad. Hope you like only using 3 guns again this year cause the m16 ak47 and mp5 are the only viable guns in multiplayer otherwise you’ll just get outgunned even when you shoot first and don’t miss you’ll still die if you don’t use those 3 guns but even if you do you have to pray that hit detection is actually working at the time otherwise you’re out of luck. In summary, this is one of if not the worst games of the franchise. Suck a dick and die for this one activision and treyarch"
125,Briansax99,"Jan  8, 2021",1,"go to hell activision you and your desire to charge so much money for a **** campaign with **** characters that you do not remember when you finished the campaign, the zombies are fine but after 10 hours you do not return to them Touch and multiplayer with SBMM is worse than a kick to the testicle and worst of all they have the nerve to charge more than 60 dollars."
126,Jawzer,"Jan  9, 2021",2,"I actually picked up Cold War during a holiday sale. Still dont think this game is worth it even counting that. Boring campaign and complete downgrade from last years MW. They took all soul and personality out of zombies and only gave us one map. Multiplayer is a complete joke, because of low visibility, boring maps, and overall just terrible weapon balance. The mechanics of this game is just budget MW. Been playing cod since black ops one when i was 10 and loved the franchise so much i went out of my way to play the old ones and every new one since. This is the first cod where ive genuinly have had zero fun and dont plan on continue playing the multiplayer. I plan on coming back and trying out the new zombie maps when they release doubt they will be any good though."
127,majmusi,"Jan 17, 2021",1,"This is my first review ever. Because it is the game that I think deserves the negative review bombardment. It is trash in it's current state. As of the time of writing this review I have spent 3 days and roughly 18 hours in this game.Where to start? SBMM? lack of content? constant crashing? Activision and Treyarch not listening to the community? Hackers? Activision helping hackers with privatising stats? Garbage hit detection? The multiplayer is awful, literally unplayable, infested with hackers if you are above a certain kdr. SBMM makes maybe 1 out of 8 games enjoyable. The content is pitiful, maps are boring. Weapons level up so god damn slow, even when there is 2 weapons XP. And you also level up very slowly, 90% after the match I get show that I've leveled up for at least two more levels than I actually have. Camo challenges still don progress and some are just plain stupid. An okay one is 5 kills without dying but then you realise the spawns are **** on every map and just when you have that 4 kills most of the time someone will spawn almost immediately behind you.Zombies is a relatively enjoyable mode - for some time. Then you get sick of the map. Ok Dead Ops arcade is also there, still that's not the zombies experience for most of the playerbase. Actually the only playable and replayable mode is zombies mode.Campaign is actually pretty damn solid. Very good, but...it lacks so much stuff. Mission 9 is still a great question to how that's even possible but I won't spoil anything.Sadly I'm one of those who blindly believed COD cannot be such a let down and prepurchased the game with ""how bad can it be?"" mindset. Very very bad. Don't buy it, don't support Activision's greed. Crack it if possible to enjoy the campaign and zombies.Why did I decide to give 1/10 score?Because of the price, the lies, the quality and the SBMM implementation itself.I would give this game probably 8/10 if it was 20 dollars or something like that and you got Battlepass included and all the prepurchase DLC. It's not worth more than that. I think this is where COD finally dies and I'm hoping Battlefield can take it's place again after BFV."
128,somwehere,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"EA is one of my favorite companies. Let me explain why. They aren't lazy losers like CDprojectred, that's why. They actually make working games every single year. Every year.Cdprojectred released no games since 2016 and in 2020 they came out with most amateurish game possible. You have to be absolute hypocrite to hate EA. I absolutely don't care how much money they wanna make. They are company, that's why companies exist by the way lmao. All i can ask is working games and EA delivers that."
129,HollywoodStar,"Nov 14, 2020",9,"This game plays incredibly well. The movement feels fast paced, the gunplay in phenomenal. The sound design is my favorite part, a lot of the guns' noises will put hair on your chest. Prior to shooting the Hauer 77 I was a little boy. After shooting it, I drink whisky and smoke cigarettes... I am a man now. The zombies feels so good. It is only one map, but the progression both in and outside of the actual game makes it feel endless. The new scrap features makes me feel as if I always have something to work towards in the game, and the Aetherium crystals work the same way outside of the game. The multiplayers maps are somewhat hit or miss. The gunplay is very fun, but some of the maps feel pretty poorly designed to fit with specific game modes. Overall though it is my favorite multiplayer since Black Ops 2. To rebuttal the people that complain about the game feeling cartoonish and arcade-like, that has always been the charm of Call of Duty in my opinion. If you want a hyper realistic game, go play Tarkov or something."
130,Onsides,"Nov 14, 2020",8,"This game is so fun. The multiplayer feels good, movement feels good, zombies is so much fun. I haven't played the campaign yet but everything else about the game and the gameplay feels fantastic. My biggest gripe with this game is that the party system sucks. Trying to join a party takes at least 3 attempts before it lets you actually join and once you are in a party, it isn't 100% guaranteed that you will end up in the same lobby as your friends. Other than that, the game feels really good. Brings me back to my childhood of playing black ops 2 for hours on end. Love it."
131,c300g97,"Nov 22, 2020",10,"Best black ops we've had since 2, awesome campaign from Raven's studios and the multiplayer feels like a great mix of classic and battlefield, which makes it awesome"
132,Jkitzy,"Nov 16, 2020",9,"The progression is good in it. The campaign is the average cod campaign where shoot every enemy then you win but it can get boring very quickly it tries to be engaging at the end which it does. the zombies is very fun and they are trying new things but some things need balancing as some things are overpowered and some things are underpowered especially in multiplayer.Really feel like Treyarch is keeping it real, this version of CoD feels closer to the original versions that sparked the entire CoD rush. Mutiplayer maps feel great and flow so much better than the sandbox style mp maps in MW2019. Zombie mode has tons of content, and allowing you to progress your weapons and profile through playing zombies as well))"
133,Bread162,"Nov 19, 2020",8,"[Played on PC, cost $79.99 CAD]The game overall is really fun. I have only played multiplayer and zombies currently, but I find both are enjoyable. The gameplay feels like a slightly more arcade-ey version of Modern Warfare 2019 which will not be to everyone's liking, but I personally think both games feel pretty good. I feels like a mix of the new Call of Duty with the old Call of Duty, with both the good and the bad. Positives:- Zombies is REALLY good, I personally think it merges the more complicated new stuff from BO3 and BO4 zombies super well with the more classic zombies gameplay of Black Ops 1, where the maps were a bit smaller and easy to set up. The systems are really interesting, but the menus used for Armor and Pack a Punch are a little cumbersome when trying to Pack a Punch or refill your armor quickly when being chased by zombies.-The sound design is good, while most definitely not as real feeling as Modern Warfare, all guns have punch and sound very heavy. This is not to everyone's taste as it can sound more exaggerated, to in my opinion I think that it sounds good while playing.-I have not played the campaign yet but I have heard it is quite good-Free zombies maps, and all content updates to the game are free due to Activision's new model Negatives:- Standard multiplayer feels really small, I personally really like the Combined Arms mode, but the standard multiplayer matches I've played have felt lack luster- The game has a fair few bugs in it, which isn't very acceptable from this franchise after so many years. They should really know better, especially with charging $10 more on the new consoles. The majority of the bugs I have experienced are in zombies rather than multiplayer, but I still think zombies is the best mode in the game.- The skins you can unlock for your guns in this game are significantly less interesting than the ones in Modern Warfare in my opinion, and while there are more with having zombies and multiplayer camos, the only interesting ones are the zombies skins"
134,jhollis977,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"This is as polished as Modern Warfare, with everything you know and love from Black Ops.  Throw in 80's music and the Cold War setting and you have a pretty damn good game for $60.  This has also been my first game to try Ray Tracing on, and it looks phenomenal."
135,mtcx,"Nov 21, 2020",9,"So, this game is a total hoot.  While the campaign isn't that interesting - it's a very linear story line shooter that isn't challenging at all - I lost interest after about 4 missions.  The multiplayer is a blast though. It's classic, straightforward multiplayer bash fest.   There aren't a lot of maps (I assume this will improve over time) but this is actually beneficial to your performance - because they're memorisable in a reasonable amount of time.The game is largely bug free (although the hit boxes are a bit overly generous) and is well executed - the menu system is simple and clear (I'm looking at you COD:BO4), the game mechanics are easily grokked.  If you're looking for a ""cold war sim"" experience, this is not it. The whole ""cold war"" theme is flimsy as hell and irrelevant but who cares, it's a blast."
136,jdmarcinek,"Nov 20, 2020",9,"Honestly, this game is everything i wanted as a cod player, because campaign is great, multiplayer is almost perfect, almost because weapon leveling is long af, and it doesnt have too many maps but without that its great, zombies are amazing i dont know honestly why this game has so low reviews cuz i really enjoyed it and i think most people either but everyone is hating this game here (i mean on metacritic) it sucks :| i guess probably these people didnt even played that game and just say what other say :("
137,4life-,"Nov 20, 2020",8,"I dont recognize any of the technical problems users are reporting on.Nor did i play any of the multiplayer modes So this is based purely based on my experience with the story. Looks cool and i love the 80s feel. Actors did a nice job,the sound and music for me was great,although it would not hurt to get more licenses to some sweet 80s classics. The graphics on my PC was great. Pretty much maxed out what i could,and it looked amazing. As mentioned before - No issues or crashes for me. Logging in via Battlenet was easy and stable. Story is very short. I love the ""Detective"" part of this game. Brilliant idea with the code cracking and finding the correct suspects. And i absolutely LOVED the ""KGB"" mission. However i wish the game was more like this mission. I absolutely loved it,and keep going back playing every option in this mission. This is something i hope the devs see,and take to heart. Also GREAT that a single player is in the game. SP is NOT dead. MORE MORE MORE,and please make it longer. I will happily pay the full price for a amazing action filled SP story. I play COD almost exclusively for that. All in all. A great game but too short. Maybe if they could sell just the Single player part for a reduced price,and i do hope they keep remember us story driven players. The game is a solid 8 for me. I would give it fullscore if there was more missions,and maybe more like the amazing KGB mission."
138,xDBluCZxD,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"After one year of suffering with MW Treyarch is back. Campaign is awesome, fun and mind blowing, Multiplayer is Black ops 1 + Black ops 3, 4 so its fun, chaotic, full of action. Zombies are awesome too. I am glad Treyarch is back and I cant wait for content!"
139,JD-Day,"Nov 20, 2020",10,"Amazing game. The singleplayer is awesome. Great variety and open maps. Zombies are even better and are extremely addictive, even in solos. The Multiplayer is %85 because the scorestreak system is stupid."
140,Jackiebiscuit,"Nov 21, 2020",9,"After playing this game for many hours, I can say it has basis to amazing! This game may have many bugs but I expect most game launches to be buggy when it comes to games like this. There is a severe lack of content but that doesn’t hurt the quality of the game in my opinion. The zombies experience is easily the best thing about this game as they have completely outdone themselves with the great cross progression system and adding many quality of life improvements like the removal of perk limit and being able to mantle everything and having the ability to easily maneuver through zombies. The multiplayer side is a bit on the rough side as I wish we had more maps but it’s fairy balanced (aside from the initial mp5 which just got nerfed) compared to most cod games, and as we all know, modern warfare 2019 was god awful with its balancing. The campaign is a very great but short action based adventure! Loved the gameplay as well as the stealth scenes. I did love the gameplay of the previous cods campaign as well and the story a bit better but I prefer cold wars story overall as well as the multiple outcome of endings. Overall, the current state of the game is alright but we just need more content! Easily the best cod we’ve had in years with its basis being so strong, they just need to build on it."

If you loved the old school CoD shooters then you will most likely appreciate Cold War.  The audio and actually being able to hear foot steps is so nice, hats off to the audio. Does it look worse than mw2019... yes and no, the maps are very clear and crisp and vibrant making enemies easy to see at long range.   The audio is not as realistic like MW19 but the gunfire doesn't drown out everything else around allowing you to hear better.  You can actually hear foot steps now which is amazing.  Careful sprinting around...lol It doesn't have all of the fancy bells and whistles MW2019 has but a few things this game has over MW is map design hands down,  Cold War has some of the best maps I have seen in years, they  flow very nice and the pace is good.  The TTK is much faster in Cold War allowing you to kill with a few shots versus a solid full clip. Overall I feel Treyarch made a FUN to play CoD this time,  it feels like Black Ops 2 all over again."
142,FatherHay,"Nov 17, 2020",7,"A lot of people, I think - are giving this game an unfair bash. With immense amounts of toxicity revolving around the game's skill-based matchmaking, rather than the wider gameplay. The campaign drew me in, and I beat it in a single sitting in about six hours. It's short, but it's definitely worth your time. The Zombies mode is fantastic fun with some friends; allowing you to even level up your multiplayer rank and weapons through its gameplay loop. I also, contrary to many people's opinions - didn't find the multiplayer that bad, in fact, I'd argue - there's far less issues with the matchmaking system in this itterattion, than in MW. Where I often found teams to be heavily stacked and the whole game to be some messy sniper camp fest. In general, the game's good - but it's far from brilliant, and most of the user scores are basically rants about how skill based matchmaking is bad. And those who say the graphics are last generation looking, clearly forgot to wear their glasses, or are running the game on toasters."
143,AfterDie,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"This is the best game in the last 5 years! After modern warfare 2019, this is just a breath of fresh air. Great storyline, great multiplayer! The game is not without flaws, but after the disastrous modern warfare 2019, Cold War 10/10, Thanks Treyarch !!!"
144,sexyfish,"Nov 14, 2020",9,"They made the campaign great again! Loved the set pieces. Multiplayer maps feel much tighter as well. Zombies not perfect, but a step up and a great addition."
145,Alexandr_K,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Игра мне понравилась, не лучшая в серии, но очень достойная. Начнём с компании. Она просто удивительная. В ней есть как и главные задания, как и побочные, которые также влияют на концовку игры. Также компания удивила меня не только правом выбора и несколькими концовками, но и сюжетными поворотами, например: Я был удивлён, что Белл изначально был за Персея, и в его, после прибытия в аэропорт, выстрелил Араш, но главные герои Black Ops спасли его и перепрограммировали, удивительно да? Так же меня поразило, что в этой части Call of Duty присутствует реальная серая мораль, которая показана не на словах разработчиков, как в MW 2019 года, а на деле. Так же удивило, что все заключения сюжета так, или иначе оставляют осадок. Т.е ни один финал нельзя считать хорошим. Если сказать правду, то Американцы смогут уничтожить бомбу, но Белла из-за того, что он слишком много знает, убьёт Адлер. Если сказать ложь, то главные герои не смогут уничтожить бомбы, а Белла застрелят за предательство. Ну а если сказать ложь и устроить засаду, то главных героев Black Ops Cold War убьют. Именно это неоднозначность и право выбора и делают сюжет Black Ops Cold War необычным, и я бы даже сказал одним из лучших сюжетов в истории Call of Duty. Перейдём в сетевую часть. Многие игроки хейтят графику, анимации оружия и карты. Я скажу тут только одно. Графика, конечно, не лучше чем в MW 2019 года, но и не хуже. Некстгена она не может показать по одной важной причине. Эта игра выходит как и на пастген версии консолей, так и на некстген. И тут возникает вопрос к тем людям, которые хотели увидеть революцию в графике. Каким макаром консоль 2016 года сможет потянуть некстген графику? Вы себя слышите? Или у вас напрочь отсутствует логика?! На счёт анимаций оружия.. Они почти в точь-точь как в MW 2019 года. Просто разработчики убрали визуальную отдачу, которая в MW 2019 года и придавала некий реализм оружию, но и одновременно мешала нормальной стрельбе, вспомните Узи. Звуки оружия на высоте, анимации тоже, карты достаточно не плохие. Мне не понравились только 2 карты - Пустыня и Картель. В пустыне очень много пустого пространства, и траншеи, в которые постоянно прыгают враги и мешают нормальному передвижению, а в Картеле посередине карты расположены кусты, которые мешают нормальной видимости. В общем всё на высоте, мне понравилось, а на хейт в мою сторону мне откровенно насрать. Моё мнение вам не изменить."
146,CougarV6,"Mar 14, 2021",2,"A huge step backward compared to Modern Warfare.   Game is ugly but less optimised,  Even Black ops 4 was more polished. Many bugs with team matching and voice chat. Looks like game rushed to publish. Really shame."
147,PowerGamer,"Dec 23, 2020",3,"Constant random crashes for everyone that I know that tries to play the game.This is the only game I have that does this. And everyone is saying it crashing on Reddit, etc., too.Not only on the PC but on consoles as well. If they tried they could monitor where in their code it's crashes and fix it but apparently they don't even bother. Maybe it's a bug(s) that very hard to track down because they are in the middle of some random thread or something, but there is no excuse. This is just very bad and lazy game development. To add insult to injury they just pretend the crashes don't exist (""It works for me!""), and instead of fixing anything they just keep adding new features and asking for more money."

Treyarch have failed this miserably, following a ban wave a while back thing actually improved and seemed to resemble something like a playable state ... a few weeks pass and BAM business as usual, blatant and persistent wall & aim hackers, absolutely broken console auto aim (it allows the player to decide the level of AI assistance based on their playtime ... a boosting honor system if you will, can't see why that would ever be abused eh!) and lastly one of the worst skill matching systems of any game i've played.

Because after you go to play the campaign its like, nah you gotta download it, heres part one… that’s right part one… youll play a mission in this joke of a campaign and then its like oh you nee to download part 2 now, heres another 26gb patch ontope of the 20 you just downloaded, but it doesn’t stope there, theres another 20 gb part 3.. .thats right.. nearly 70 GB patched in for not even 4 hour long campaign. That they couldn’t just put on the disc… downloading multiplayer and zombies makes sense because its primarily online.. but a 4 hour long campaign, it’s a joke…I for one do understand why so many people love call of duty, its multiplayer, and thankfully its just as fun here as its ever been with all of its modes outside of team deathmatch.. that’s usually my favorite mode, but I just wasn’t feeling the maps this year in deathmatch, but I had an absolute blast anyway for hours playing that ultra addicting, spawn shoot die gameplay, and its been a hwile since ive played a call of duty game.. since ww2.. so im not sure if these things are new but I am loving the instant respawns here on the next gen.. and I also appreciate that camping snipers have a little reflection to give away their location.. ive never been a fan of zombies mode, its obviously here.. I cant fairly critique it as it just isn’t my thing… but the main reason I play a call of duty game, at least in my currently life where I don’t have the time to sink days into multiplayer is the campaign.. but thankfully I do have the fun and addictive multiplayer to play through while it takes more hours to download than it does to actually play…Here you play as yourself, during the cold war, and the campaign actually started with tons of promise.. I wouldn’t mind if every year we got a well told 3-4 hour long story full of amazing set pieces and a mind blowing experience to compliment the fun multiplayer, and this campaign had its moments, it felt like an interactive movie with great moments and missions, some of the best stealth missions ive ever experienced in a first person shooter, but halfway through the campaign just falls apart, it becomes generic first person shooter level design and story telling, theres even a section of the game here youre redoing the same thing like 5 times in a row… that’s how much you can tell the creative juices have evaporated after an impressive start.. I didn’t want to stop playing, but I had to to let part 2 download… such a let down…Call of Duty is what it is…You know what youre going to get every year…it never changes outside of the setting..and this is where the let down comes into playIm personaly okay with a little 4 hour journey each year, but please put a little more effort and see that effort through, especially if again,, its only going to be 4 hours… it better be solid.But at least you have some new maps to play with.I give Call of Duty Black Ops Cold Wara 7/10"
150,AsheZx,"Jan 10, 2021",4,"An excellent, innovative zombies mode and fantastic campaign is brought down by a terrible multiplayer experience that is clearly incomplete, rushed and poorly executed. Not to mention the plethora of technical issues, such as challenges not completing, game crashes, visual bugs etc. that plague this game. If you buy this game, buy it for it's campaign and zombies, and don't ever pay full price for it. £15 is all this game is worth."
151,Lirezh,"Nov 25, 2020",5,"Nice updated game mechanics, better upgrading system, nice visuals, fluid gameplay, short loading times and a better bonus mechanic.And no cheat protection at all, the first premium cheats were available BEFORE launch. The COD game developers know how to make a game feel good but they don't know how to develop it resistant to the worst cheats. Wallhacks are probably the #1 cheat the average joe prefers to use."
152,chumpwithnoname,"Jan  4, 2021",7,"I liked single player, however there are lots of problems with this game itself:1. Indestructable things like bottles - this is next gen shooter? You basically can't shoot any bottle in this game...2. Even with RTX ON there are no self reflections in the mirrors. I've seen games from 20 years ago which had this feature.3. Gunplay is bad. Most of weapons are somehow feel wrong - they are underpowered.4. Sound is very bad. It is light years behind Battlefield games.5. Lots of stuff is low-res in this game even with 4k textures low.6. Game sometimes likes to stutter on 3080, you need to restart it to get normal performance. i'm giving this game 7 points cause I didn't pay for it directly and got it as a part of 3080 package deal. Also I don't care about multiplayer cause it is created to milk players."
153,luckydutch,"Mar  4, 2021",3,Picked it up on the free weekend. Still plagued by the same-old issues. Jump shooting and slide shooting is out of control. The guns and maps are OK but the core gameplay is ruined by absolutely everyone exploiting jumpshots. Pass.

155,Puggles,"Jan  1, 2021",4,"This game was so promising at release, but now I can say for certain that this game is going to get worse over time and it already has been. With the story mode I liked it as It wasn't long and dragged out like some of the other campaigns. Compared to black ops 4, I prefer the zombies in cold war to BO4 zombies. The reason why is that there is no monetization in the zombies game mode like for example, the elixirs and gobble gums. I would feel that the downside is that there is only one map and it gets repetitive replaying the same map over and over again. The map design in COLD WAR's zombies is great as it has wide open areas to train compared to BO4's narrow map design. I like the loadouts, specials, and the return of original perks..... Otherwise Its a step in the right direction. My problems is with everything else. Like for example, you need a constant internet connection to play every game mode like campaign and solo zombies. It does not make any sense to me and if the developers decide to shut down the servers. The end result is going to be the death of this game forever. So much for the preservation of games. For some reason every update for PC it ends up making the game worse with constant UI errors, glitches and crashes that make the game unplayable. I also disagree with the inclusion of modern warfare being shoehorned into the menu screen without the option of removing it. The reason I paid for this game is to play COLD WAR, not Modern Warfare. It also makes the menu screen look cluttered. As an old COD player, this is my first time being exposed to the ""seasons/battle pass"" scheme. I can say for certain its not worth the money. Because in my opinion, there really isn't a whole lot of content in it that enhances the experience as it only has COD points (I despise cod points), skins, one new character, double xp tokens, and other cosmetic items. And seeing how there was a badass trailer for stich, I thought there was going to be more added story missions but I was mislead. It seems like Treyarch also cares more about selling cosmetic bundles rather than releasing actual good content. These bundles are not worth the price and they are being produced at a rapid rate.... No, I am not going to pay 20$ for an character that should have been in the battle pass (honestly, go **** yourself Treyarch/activision. No, i am not going to pay 10$ -20$ for an anime gun camo for 2 guns that shoots purple tracer rounds. Its ridiculous and its infuriating because the game was perfectly fine without all these cosmetic microtransactions. It just goes to show how much corporate greed has found there way into video games. The final problem I wanted to talk about it the multiplayer. It lacks consistency with every gun being nerfed and buffed. The lack of maps is shocking and despite that, the games spawn system is dreadful. Every second the spawns keep on getting flipped which can be annoying. And I still get spawned killed regardless! Please remove SBMM In conclusion, I would recommend to not buy this game. The game initially can be very good and fun, but after a while it starts to become boring, repetitive, lack of content, and the addition of corporate greed that recently got shoved into the game. Seriously Treyarch/Activision? The game was fine without the microtransactions and the monetization schemes! If this is the best you can do then I don't see how anyone will stay on this game after a year. This game could have been a return to the good old COD days. But it ended up becoming a mediocre game and a missed opportunity."

157,Deothor,"Jan 15, 2021",0,"I wish I could review this game for what it has, but because of bugs and really BAD performance I couldn't even play through 1 full match.I also couldn't play with a friend because of some 'party not available' bugs. If that's what AAA games are, then I think I'll stick with indie games that at least are playable."
158,TheSnipingBacon,"Nov 30, 2020",9,"Overall this game is the best Call of Duty in recent years. As a Call of Duty veteran I can say that this Campaign is by far the best in the franchise, with Black Ops and MW2 coming in right behind. The mission designs and the storytelling is top-tier and the twist in the story brings back tons of nostalgia. If you love the first Black Ops campaign like I do then you are in for a real treat. ""The numbers Mason, what do they mean!?"". The replay-ability and different choices you can make open new dialogues and makes you want to replay missions. The way you have to find evidence across multiple missions in order to complete the two side missions is a great addition to the series as well. The campaign brings you to places that gave you huge nostalgia with the Summit, Jungle, and Firing Range vibes. One of the better parts of the campaign are the stealth missions you have to play which include the KGB Headquarters, a fortified Russian Base, and the German streets. Overall the campaign alone is a 9/10! The multiplayer overall is a fun but aggravating time. This game has only been out for a while, so it will take some time to fix, but the guns need HUGE balancing. The good thing is every gun is useful since the time to kill is very fast, but there are still some that are far superior than others (MP5, Krig, AUG). The camper problem is at an all time high with people sitting in a corner with a Stoner w/ACOG just absolutely lasering you. Also the skill-based-match-making puts you into constant sweaty games. The majority of the maps are bad (Cartel, Armada) with a couple that actually are playable (Moscow, Garrison). The recent addition of Nuketown is nice but tiring since this map always ends up in a Black ops game. The overall balancing of the perks and equipment are good, but scorestreaks need some tuning as well. I cannot tell you how many times I have been killed by a Napalm Strike when I was indoors not near any windows or doors. RC-XDs are basically a one shot to destroy which needs to be tweaked I feel. Calling cards are not that cool in this game and feel very dull or just not pleasant for the eyes. Overall multiplayer would get a 7/10. There is one word to describe Zombies...............AWESOME. They have really outdone themselves with this zombies being one of my favorites. With your weapons xp and normal xp carrying over to multiplayer from zombies, it makes zombies even more worth it to play. Die Maschine is a good map and is always a fun time even with randoms! Overall zombies gets a 8/10."
159,El_Mundo,"Jan  8, 2021",1,"Absolute downgrade to Modern Warfare or hell even Black Ops 4. The character movement is extremely shaky and wonky, the graphics are mediocre, nearly no maps (like 10 total) and less guns total than the Machinepistol category in MW. New guns are an insanely hard grind. For example ""Kill three enemies in quick succession with the knife in multiplayer"" to unlock a sledgehammer. Only thing is that every enemy drops you in 5 shots. Shotguns do less damage than even pistols. They brough player hosting back instead of Dedicated servers which leads to a lot of connection issues in an already bug infested game. All that is already bad but the worst part is, that people that play with controller have the strongest aimbot in any shooter i have ever seen. Its okay that there is one in the first place as its not easy to aim with a controller but in this game you only need to get somewhere close with your aim and it moves center mass on its own with reduced recoil. This results in aimbot behaviour people would have been reported for in Modern Warfare. If your aim isnt pro league worthy and you are on PC, forget it. To add insult to injury Playstation players also level considerably faster. Both character level and guns. Gun leveling takes forver if you arent a Playstation player. Just stay away from this game."
160,Darkvenom39,"Nov 16, 2020",5,"I feel bad for giving this game this score. It had so much potential!After seeing the trailer where former president ronald regan was introduced and seeing mason, woods, hudson, and my new favorite adler. I was so hyped for the game especially after seeing that it is based on real life events and with actual facts of the real perseus actually being lost on our real life planet till this day! and i also loved the interview with yuri bezmonov in the trailers it really got me hyped.So far the beta came and everyones impressions were bad but for me it looked like classic black ops with a fan favorite spin to todays era.But when the game came out i literally forgot it came out because no one was talking about it, and luckily i got reminded that i got a battlenet gift card from my boss to buy the cold war as a bday present from a week before the release. So i downloaded the game and so far the impressions were good about the campaign. It is full of action! Like non stop explosions and shooting and soundtrack is phenomenal. And also the acting is great. But i felt like it was super short and you could finish it within a playthrough including the floppy disk secret ending. It took me about 5 hours to finish the campaign and it didnt feel right for the fans because, There was less of mason and woods and more about ""Bell"" which is you and the whole character creation stuff is pretty pointless besides the perks but still a major disappointment and i really wanted this story to kick ass after my hype from the trailers. But it felt so rushed and effortless and very straight forward it left me wanting more after i finished with the best good ending. So overall about the campaign i wish it was longer and the desicions you had to make to sacrifice one character to choose to save the other was so poorly done because i didnt have any emotions towards those characters and the ending part is where the choosing is at, and yeah the interactions with the characters in the hideout is pointless 100% dont interact with anyone. So in the end the campaign is a total missed potential of something truly big and record breaking. Multiplayer wise, well... Its not good. With so little variety and like 3 maps to play and awful customization and modes were okish, the new modes arent as fun. So i wouldnt recommend the MP mode as well its just meh. Zombies! ohh yeah the zombies! Its fun but you wont find a public lobby and players to play with besides yourself and friends. Overall: This game is such a missed potential and if you got it as a gift or on sale then good for you, otherwise dont spend money on this call of duty. Im still sticking to infinity wards absolute masterpiece from last year (Modern warfare) and i will not be playing this game anymore. The good things about this game is the implementation to pc with Dlss and RTX but other than that it also has its good moments in its campaign and zombies is fun. This game just left bad taste in my mouth and i would probably visit it after updates, and im also asking myself how did 5 major studios release such a crap within a year or so of development, this is what happens when you rush to release a new COD every year, this should be stopped! I want the next COD to release when its ready with at least 3 years down the line."
161,Raziels,"Dec 21, 2020",0,"En mi reseña me voy a centrar en el multijugador ya que es a lo que más horas le dedico siempre a la franquicia. Llevo jugando a la saga desde Cod 4 y jamás he visto un modo multijugador tan destrozado y tan descompensado, todo gracias a su SBMM( Skill Based Matchmaking), la frustración que da jugar a su modo online es desesperante, jugadores escondidos en esquinas, partidas en las que parece que estás jugando la final de un torneo o la liga de Call of Duty. Nunca he sido un jugador especialmente bueno, mi KD es de 1.24 y tengo la sensación a veces de estar jugando contra jugadores profesionales y mi equipo agazapado en cualquier esquina por miedo a perder su proporción o porque es gente que no concuerda con su ratio real. El diseño de mapas es lamentable y sumado a su SBMM se hacen insoportables, todo para beneficiar a jugadores que se esconden en cualquier esquina. Jamás estarán los Cods nuevos a la altura de MW1 y 2, Black Ops 1 y 2, juegos en los que se usaba un sistema de búsqueda de partidas por conexión y no te emparejaba por habilidad, eran partidas rápidas y para divertirse, ahora desde la salida de MW de 2019 es imposible jugar partidas rápidas porque parecen todas competitivas y llegan ha cansar y agobiar el estar todo el rato jugando de esa forma. La partidas rápidas son para jugar sin competir, si quiero un modo liga me uno a el y  no esto, por mi parte Treyarch has perdido un jugador más mientras siga Activision apostando por éste modelo de emparejamiento y de negocio. Como veterano de la saga no os vuelvo a dar una oportunidad más y más después de sufrir el SBMM de MW y su multijugador plagado de camperos con SBMM.En definitiva para mí es el peor Cod que he probado en todos mis años de experiencia con la saga y lo peor es que habrá fanboys siempre que lo defenderán a pesar de todas las quejas que lleva teniendo éste título desde su Alpha, no os gastéis el dinero en este juego esa es mi recomendación"
162,philzlz,"Jan 29, 2021",7,"I received this game for free with a purchase of a new nvidia gpu. While the singleplayer was enjoyable at first the last missions were pretty disappointing. The whole game you are hunting Perseus but the last objective makes you destroy AA guns for an airstrike, pretty underwhelming. Why not a mission where you hunt him down or abort the launch of the nukes with a timed objective? The multiplayer was better in the last iteration, there are not enough maps and the ones that we get are pretty underwhelming. Modern Warfare has more realistic gun sounds, graphics and overall was more fun to play."
163,zNeverSleeping,"Dec 20, 2020",0,"Eu já joguei muito fps, e eu posso dizer com certeza que esse game tem a pior gunplay que tive o desprazer de testar. Numa tentativa desesperada de deixar os jogadores de console pareis ao jogadores de PC, a desenvolvedora preguiçosa Treyarch ""capou"" propositalmente a mecânica de troca de tiro do jogo. Tracking? Headshot? Flick? Nada disso importa, um jogador de console medíocre ainda é capaz de te dar hitkill usando duas pistolas e uma assistência de mira que ofende até mesmo um jogador de PS3. Resultado: a gameplay é massante e oferece um teto de skill ofensivo para aqueles que buscam melhorar. Enfim, diferente do Modern Warfare, que vale a pena jogar, esse daqui está fadado ao fracasso."

I assume this is what people mistake as lag when they complain that the game is laggy), but now I can rack kills same as usual.

167,RedBobb,"Mar 15, 2021",7,"Follows Modern Warfare's engine and Season Pass conceptThe fact that you can buy 'upgraded' weapons (instead of plain skins) is a bit rubbish. Storyline offers something new, being more paced but still actions scenes present. Giving you a lot of freedom to play the way you want too, almost giving some aspects of an RPG that you wouldn't normally expect from a CoD game. Multiplayer still seems bare, however the pandemic will have had an effect. Needs more maps, however returning to NukeTown is awesome. I'd recommend it on sale, maybe not for full price unless you're invested to play the game.Graphics look nice but can also be reduced to awful looking (for those of us with lesser rigs). Zombies is supposed to be good, however not so much my cup of tea personally. I'd recommend trying it if you can get it on sale, or if you were invested in Modern Warfare (2019)"

173,GoodGuyMatty,"Dec 26, 2020",0,"This game in every single way is a massive step back from it's predecessor Modern warfare. Graphics are worse, gunplay is worse, animations are worse and the game is riddled with glitches likely never to be patched by a now soulless fan-favorite COD developer: Treyarch. This studio is responsible for making the top three best COD games ever made, which are (in descending order): Black ops, Black ops 3 and black ops 2. These incredible games were the reason I was excited for what now seems to be a lazy, pathetic sequel to an otherwise fantastic trilogy. To start the user interface is perhaps the worst in any game I've played yet, with still no option do modify audio settings without having them reset as if I hadn't. It seems that there is a missing 'apply' button, this also means that I cannot communicate in anyway with game chat, limiting me to the systen specific text chat, which console players are unable to interact with. I am also unable to host an in-game party because my status is permanently set to 'offline' for whatever reason, meaning nobody can join me, nor can they accept an invite, which would only do nothing. Furthermore, I've experienced plenty of crashes, a plethora of connectivity issues (which in the zombies gamemode will result in a seemingly instant death after reconnection), UI overlapping issues and far too much more to list. As for the gameplay; The Campaign featured even more terrible issues; AI teammates would constantly get stuck in place, forcing me to restart an unfun, underdeveloped level with floating objects and poor enemy placement, which would prove an immeasurable nuisance on the 'realism' difficulty, which would require me to constantly replay checkpoints after an unavoidable, scripted 3+ enemies would shoot at me at the same time causing an instant death. Levels were clearly not play tested on higher difficulties. The multiplayer is just as bad, with the game using 20hz servers meaning that many shots dont even register. For reference PUBG (remember that game?) uses 60hz servers. There are plenty of underpowered and overpowered guns to never be balanced because Treyarch clearly just doesnt care anymore, and it painful to watch. I'm tired of writing, so I'm gonna dumb it down a bit. The maps are **** gunplay is **** (especially sniper ADS). zombies is not good either. Its definitely the best part of the game, but that's not saying much. Cold war zombies is better than Black ops 4, but hasn't got **** on Black ops 3, which is the best possible zombies experience you can have across all call of duties. In conclusion this piece of **** is an overpriced, underdeveloped, unloved by its parents, disappointment that I am embarrassed to have paid $100 (AUD) for. Now that were on the topic of price, what the **** is up with that? Every other game on pc is like $80 max now! Even triple A games. Why the **** does this piece of **** game cost so much? Also black ops 1 on steam is $50 and it came out 10 years ago. Lower the ****ing price and people would actually buy them for nostalgia you ****ing corporate retards. You're paying such a high price when a third of the game isnt even active anymore (multiplayer) **** this game."

176,LeManne,"Nov 15, 2020",5,"First, let me start off by saying that I had a generally good time with the campaign in this game. Levels are fun and it's always nice to see returning characters from previous Black Ops games. The most interesting aspect of it is the titular Cold War era that it takes place in. Lots of mystery and great music from the time period. However, there are some noticeable bugs here and there, and certain recurring parts of the campaign (keeping vague to avoid spoilers) seem to not have the PC optimizations that the marketing team for the game seem to love to tout. Specifically, the game seems to just ignore the field of view you have selected in the options in favor of having a super zoomed in view that genuinely made me feel a little ill when moving around the environment. Other than these issues though, the story campaign was pretty fun (if short). Next, the main reason I have chosen to give this game such an average score: the multiplayer. Coming from CoD Modern Warfare 2019, the multiplayer in this game feels like a gigantic step backwards for the series. All movement in the game feels rather floaty, and actually shooting at enemy players just isn't fun. Coming from CoD2019, which felt grounded and ""tactile"", the multiplayer in this game just feels woefully underdeveloped. This is a real shame, as I remember loving the multiplayer of both Black Ops 1 and 2 back in the day. Apart from how the multiplayer feels, the game itself just looks blurry. I played the game using a 2080 Super GPU, and no matter what settings I changed, I just could not make the game look good. Also, once again coming back to PC optimization, it is baffling to me that there is no option to disable film grain as of this time. This decision makes the game look even more blurry, and made me feel as if I was playing while looking through some kind of Vaseline filter. If you told me that this CoD was from a few years ago, I would probably believe you. I remember booting up CoD 2019 when it first released last year, and I was surprised at just how ""new"" it felt. It felt exciting, like CoD was finally mixing things up with their movement system and how guns really had kick to them. Cold War in comparison feels flat and as if it is regressing in the great changes that were introduced just a year prior. I like Call of Duty games. They are a guilty pleasure of mine that I continue to play despite the greedy and consumer unfriendly decisions of publisher Activision (they charge full price WITH a battle pass, WITH a shop with microtransactions? That's insane!). I tend to buy the latest iteration of CoD each year, and most of the time I have a great time with it. This year though, just a few days after launch, I feel like dropping Black Ops Cold War. This doesn't feel like a polished product, and I feel major buyers remorse this time around."
177,HydrA_,"Nov 16, 2020",7,"for each game mode I will rate out of 3. Campaign and zombies are good gamemodes but the multiplayer, it is horrible. The balance in the multiplayer is close to zero. Personally as a cod fan since mw2 the multiplayer is not very enjoyable. Campers are still in the game and quick scoping got nerfed hard since the beta.  Along with the low amount of new content, would rate a 0/3. The campaign is debatably one of the best in cod. Zombies has a new twist on it and is fun too. Would rate both a 3/3. The last point will go to if the game can improve or not. We know that treyarch can do some magic so my hopes are high that they can improve. If they make the game more like the beta and add new content this game will be so much better."
178,igor_cheron,"Nov 18, 2020",7,"The game is average. The campaign is extremely short and rather superficial. There is no depth as the plot unfolds and the villains, Perseus' henchmen are all boring, without charisma, and just die very easily. The end of the story is predictable, even though there is the possibility of choices. System of choices that by the way is flawed, with no real impact on the game, and gives the impression that it is included unnecessarily. The graphics are OK. Not surprising and not much progress compared to MW, which is very disappointing, as we are in the new generation, and it should be better! The gameplay is OK, also nothing very innovative compared to the previous ones. First person immersion is acceptable, but nothing incredible. Animations could be better. Multiplayer is fun, despite the huge delay in leveling weapons. The mechanics of grenades and C4 are very appealing, as they kill very easily, even at a considerable distance from the explosion. Another point is that the game was barely released and there are already hackers. This is disheartening."

As i never played Singleplayer of CoD seriously, i would rather start with Multiplayer.Its garbage. Almost. It looks like a whole new franchise based on Cold War times, but it has nothing to do with real Black Ops 1 game that many people still remember and play. Cold War is a game for soyboys, with fancy music, that has nothing to do with somewhat industrial cold ambient of BO1, and Cold War is also a dramatically raw product. In every way, basically. There are only 5 assault rifles, 5 smgs, 3 lmgs, 3 pistols and ONLY TWO shotguns in this game right now. Year 2020. No comments. Only 8 maps are availiable, some of them lag so hard that on minimal settings game runs in 50 fps, showing graphics of Far Cry 3 or Warface at the same minimal option. Game is absolutely unoptimized, also i should mention that with my headset everything sounds very quiet, although i tried all sound presets that were availiable.TTK is very strange and looks like someone wanted to make all-in-one game called like ""Call of Playerunknown's Battlefield"". You can very rarely kill 2 or 3 people at once, its just impossible and your reaction means nothing. Skill based matchmaking is also a big problem, but i cant say much about that because havent played enough, probably. Your guns fly all over the screen, feels like your operator has strong epilepsy... All i can say is that Cold War looks like a Black Ops caricature, its just raw and somewhat stupid to play. Its like playing something between mobile arcade clone of CoD, PUBG and Far Cry 3, but in 50-60 fps and ten years old graphics.But I still believe in 3arch and hope they fix these massive problems, because the basic concept of the game is fantastic."
181,Lbriggs,"Nov 24, 2020",1,"Story is a joke they have changed all the voice actors, Woods sounds like he is a pack a day smoker, Mason doesn't even speak anymore and Hudson sounds like a they hired the janitor as an voice actor. Dialogue is terrible, Plot it overblown and filled with all this BS Evidence to Collect and overcomplicated story. On an technical side it looks worse than the last Cod MW and Runsa worse on PC at launch you shouldn't even level up properly. I was hoping this would be better and an proper so called ""Sequal"" to the original and best Black Ops but it's terrible and will be the last Cod I ever purchase in this dead franchise."
182,Drewader,"Dec 21, 2020",1,"This game would be great, but Activision/Treyarch have yet to address the constant crashing issue the game causes on all platforms. I personally have a high-end PC and the game freeze, crash, and/or crashes my whole PC multiple times a day.I've put up with it for the past week and hoped it would be address with some patches, but nope. They would much prefer to put out NukeTown than address the severe issues with their game. Which leaves me very close to seeking a refund for my purchase and not returning to the game, even if its eventually fixed. I do not want to support a company that refuses to address issues that should have been addressed by now. Update: The game has not gotten better since the season, that was a week late started. In fact the season only further enhanced the issues with the game. There is clearly no hack prevention because it us absolutely rampant. Especially now that they opened up Trial Accounts. Optimization for RTX is dumpster. Clearly the developers and company are only concerned with putting out a cash grab.Treyarch you suck. The only decent part of this game was the campaign, but that is overshadowed by the massive dumpster fire that the multiplayer is."
183,BossCrab,"Nov 27, 2020",9,"Everybody is complaining about this game, but I think the actual gameplay has improved drastically. Sure there are some voice chat issues, graphics are a little arcadey and bug issues here and there. But overall a very fun game to play: the increasing of TTK, plus speed of movement and anti-camping style maps are just few of the many positives this game brings. When getting shot at you actually have a chance to evade and retaliate making skill more of a factor rather than right place at the right time. Weapon attachments are a lot more clear on what they actually do, and are structured in a better way so that positives and negatives are evenly balanced therefore everything has a use depending on your style of play. In my opinion they have mastered all the necessities i in making a great call of duty game and I greatly look forward to seeing what updates it brings us. At first I wasnt so sure of it (mainly due to different style of graphics), but after playing for a week I am very satisfied with it. Dont even get me started on zombies: it seems to make 3 hours disappear in what feels like 30 minutes. You can tell a lot of love has been put into this game and Treyarch should be very proud of what they have created.e"
184,Mimain,"Nov 30, 2020",9,"Great campaign scenario and very beautiful game. As a casual gamer, I really enjoy the multi-player too."
185,Snufflux,"Mar  4, 2021",4,"Horribly unbalanced multiplayer, if you aren't using a burst rifle with shotgun secondary you just lose. Singleplayer is decent, for a CoD campaign. Nothing great but nothing worth getting outraged over. The zombies has been ok as well, they offer some changes that keep it fresh for old players while also giving incentives for new players to engage in the mode. However, the multiplayer can't be overlooked as it is the meat and potatoes of the game. Not only are there balance issues, but there's just a lack of content all around. With very few maps and a small selection of guns compared to previous entries in the series, there just isn't enough variety to give any reason to keep playing. There is a promise of post-launch content, but this feels like it should've been part of release with how little to do there is in this game. Lastly, why is just the act of trying to party up with friends so horrendously broken? 90% of the time I try to play with friends we get some sort of error, and the amount of times we've lost a party member upon loading into a game is just annoying. This game could have a used another year in the oven to bake and is just more evidence as to why annual releases are outdated and bad for developers and players."
186,PinkSentry,"Dec  8, 2020",8,"Call of Duty Cold War Review Call of Duty Cold War definitely feels different than the other Black Ops games. Some view the Cold War as a step down from most CoD games. But I beg to disagree. I certainly understand why people do not like this new game, either because they have been playing for years; and haven’t seen anything outstanding that has happened in this new game. Or it just feels bland and boring. But from my perspective, a person who has less experience in the Call of Duty community, sees it as a time grabbing game. So I decided, for this review, to break the game into 3 categories. Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies (the 3 main parts of the game). Campaign Personally, the campaign is the Staple of the game. My main complaint about the campaign is how unrealistic it is compared to the real cold war. But maybe that is just the history side of me speaking. The campaign is a choice type campaign, a lot like Detroit: Become Human, and The Walking Dead game. There are 3 different endings that can be chosen by what you choose. campaign is rather short, but can be extended if you play for different endings. Parts of the game are very unexpected and captivating. The characters in the story are likeable and at times, comedic (especially Woods). The Graphics are probably the best highlight of the game. If you were able to get your hands on the Playstation 5, the graphics will look as realistic as they get. The story itself is a bit hard to follow because of how they add choices to the game, but if you pay attention then you will notice how well written it is. Multiplayer The multiplayer is the biggest downside to the game. It’s not terrible, but it's just bland. But the new battle pass coming December 16th should change this. The weapons seem balanced. An example of this is the sniper class. As a new player you will get the Pellington Rifle. This gun is the best of the 3 snipers in the game. At level 55, you will get the last Sniper Rifle, and the last gun in the game, but it is nowhere near as good as the Pellington. This gives new players a great chance of doing better than the people who are already at prestige 3. A problem with multiplayer is the visual glitches. Visual glitches have been a problem in Call of Duty for a while now, but they seem to have gotten worse in Cold War. One of the most common glitches is the rainbow glitch. When playing you can sometimes, by chance, get a glitch that makes the textures on the map turn into rainbow glowing tiles. It may look pretty at first, but the longer you play the more annoying it gets. The maps are not the most balanced, but they are definitely beautiful. Zombies Zombies are probably one of my favorite parts of this game. It is definitely a step up from the other ones we have had recently. This new zombies gives us Bosses, New Wonder Weapons, Storyline, Easter eggs, and of course, a buffed up RayGun. The map is the classic Die Maschine map. The map has so many easter eggs in it I couldn’t put it all into this one review. But the most outstanding easter egg would be the Disco Dimension/Coffin Dance easter egg. When you shoot out a certain amount of blue orbs around the map you get teleported to a dimension with dancing zombies carrying a crate while doing the coffin dance. No, I am not joking. If you are lucky, or skilled you can get a gun known as the Decompressive Isotopic Estrangement Machine. Or as I call it, the Zombie Sucker 3000. This gun can suck up zombies around you and shoot out a giant shockwave that does a bolt load of damage. There is a storyline in the game that plays every time you start the game, so expect to remember the voices in your head while you're playing. The storyline is pretty interesting, and you can find “intel” across the map that gives you more info about it. Overall this is probably my favorite mode in Cold War, and I can’t wait to see what they have planned for the updates to come."

188,Vampires,"Dec 13, 2020",8,"Is it better than black ops 2? No Is it a good game? Depend enough This is the first cod I get since ghost, and well the campaign is good enough, and zombies is pretty fun even if the map is not as good as bo2 zombie maps, the changes they did to the game make it fresh enough and I like the idea of exfil. Multiplayer is no the best but it is decent enough Ill give it a 8 score, even if the game is probably a 6/7"
189,Goldackthos,"Dec 13, 2020",0,"This game is a downgraded versions of the previously CoD launched last year, some features have been removed and the graphics are worse, bad optimization on PC, bugs and crashes occur frequently.The multiplayer experience in MW is far better than that, not just the maps but the the game itself feels better. The matchmaking is terrible, always enter a game in half.I have bought mostly for zombies but this game launched with only one map. Seriously?This is another of those cash-grab games."
190,unique_rucci,"Feb 15, 2021",6,"The campaign is 10/10, had a lot of fun in there. The story is amazing.Zombies are okay, only 2 maps, but I think there is more coming. And now the worst: Multiplayer - SBMM ruining your matches. Basically, it restrains you from getting better, it puts you in a lobby based on your last stats in a game. There is NO REASON why to play this game, all the other COD are better, not all but, don't buy this if you are expecting fun. Good things - campaign, zobiesBad things - multiplayer SBMM, seasons It's depressing how we are downgrading from past CODS, like Modern Warfare 2019, Black Ops II ext."
191,OnceIWasABear,"Dec 20, 2020",2,"I made a Metacritic account just to say how awful of a game this is. Let's start with the multiplayer, a huge lack of content on launch, only 7 new maps, (but, you'll only be playing the okay ones which makes the map pool like 3) and after the new season, only one new maps, and three new operators. The guns are also horribly unbalanced, for every gun class, you only see a small group of guns that rule the kill feed, the Krig 6, MP5, Galio (or Spas-12), MAC-10, AUG, and the M16, it's stupid how good they get when you level them up, they can kill you before you can even get a shot off and knowing the Cold War servers, you won't even see them. Now the Zombies, one map on release, really. It baffles my mind how they came up with one map for this gamemode, it was and still is a staple of the Black Ops series and i don't know how you **** it up, I know they and to change studios half way through and COVID, well, you know what happened there, but I really wouldn't care if this game took a couple more months to come out. On top of all this, you can't even get the ending most of the time because of countless glitches. The only slightly redeeming quality is the campaign, it's good, but not that good, it feels like a Black Ops campaign, but done by someone who was only told what a Black Ops campaign is, and they didn't even get the original voice actors for Woods and Mason. Extras I don't really feel like getting into:Graphics feel like a step down for Modern Warfare 2019.Sound effects are not as gritty or real as MW.Wall banging reduces your bullet damage by 99.99% even if it's 1"" thick plywood because why the **** not.Speaking of wall banging, sometimes you can't even wall bang 1"" thick plywood. Perfect example, the windows on Nuketown, try wall banging them, I dare you. In conclusion, this game still feels like it's in beta, I hope they'll fix it, but they're probably to focused on Warzone."
192,peegaming,"Dec 20, 2020",3,"More disappointing than black ops 4. This game is a huge let down. Other than the story being great, it's so short lived. 5 hour campaign. 1 zombie map. Multiplayer is actual garbage. I'd rather sacrifice 200+ gb of my hard drive just to play modern warfare again instead of this broken mess of a game."
193,ColossalChris,"Dec 21, 2020",0,"This games multiplayer is absolutely horrendous!! It encourages camping. It is extremely unbalanced and the spawns are terrible. Some attachments are senseless like an increase to slide speed. The visibility is bad and the fact that you need an attachment in the game to increase your spotting distance says alot! This game is absolutely not worth the money they're asking as it is using an old engine of Call of Duty, the tick rate for the servers are 20 hz which is crap. Only thing giving this the slightest bit of playability is the zombies. Which at this point would have me only pay $20 for this game. Big Disappointment!"
194,JudgePixel,"Dec 23, 2020",0,"Another pile of not preformed well ideas. I understand we are desperate to keep the Gravy Train that is known as Call of Duty rolling, but you can't do it like this, it isn't right. This game is such a step in the wrong direction, even after they botch a great game in modern warfare. It's upsetting that this is the result of things today. It's most certainly time for a new developer before this franchise finds its self dead and gone."

199,VICE27,"Dec 27, 2020",0,"Very very bad.. 70€ trashed. If this was an Indie game, it would be ok.. But after 20 years of COD, how, HOW can't you make a balanced game, with balanced guns and balanced maps? The guns are pointless, 0 balance, so everybody use 3 or 4 guns that are over powered. All the weapons are soulless, they transmit nothing to you, they are flat.. the attachments are useless, you won't notice any differences with or without, the challenges to get the camos are the same for every guns......... BOOORING. The maps are too few and bad designed, too many fake corners/boxes/holes were people can camp. The spawns are a MESS. Sometimes you get spanw-killed by someone that just spawn behind you (WHAT?! HOW?! WHY?!). One month after buying the game they put it on sale, 50%... This is a CLEAR signal of how wrong this game is, but no correction patch has been released, they just added 2 other maps and another 1 over power gun that made the game even worst."
200,huntd,"Dec 27, 2020",0,This game looks good that is all.  The solo adventure is very short. The multiplayer is dominated by consoles with their no skill mash buttons aim assist.  No one plays zombies.  Player base is small. I suggest looking elsewhere for your FPS fix this game is dead.  Long wait times for games. Currently seeking a refund as game is not as advertised.
201,Moontrance,"Dec 29, 2020",0,"That's first and last CoD I've bought. I didn't even download company, but bought it to play with my friend online. And our experience was awful and unacceptable for such big title.MP Cons:1) TTK. Rifles do NOT kill in the head. 400 ms is the only number you need to know. No chance vs 2 enemies, no no chance vs shotgun camper.2) Maps are not balanced, boring, have a lot of ""dark corners"". In a couple with TTK, I assume this game rewards campers.3) Sniper experience is absolutely disgusting. They ""balanced"" it with 400 ms of ADS. Which is huge advantage on gamepad I guess, cuz you can use aim assist while scoping.4) Spawns. It's kinda bad trick from drunk clown. Sides are changing every 30s.5) Progress. Default guns are weak, you need to spend A LOT of time to get best builds.6) Matchmaking. Looks like they have no balance at all, you first game can be vs 100th lvls, and you'll have no chance to win due to #57) Tech. problems. Game is crashing, FPS is low even of high-end PCs. It's pretty hard to get stable 144 fps in this ""competitive"" game.Uncompetitive, unfair game with a lot of tech. and gameplay problems. I will never ever buy CoD again. 0/10."
202,Abekatten,"Dec 29, 2020",2,"Hmm where to start with this COD...The campaign: It's actully good, a bit short like most COD campaigns. The graphics are great and it runs smoothly. So thumps up! There some sneaky sneaky missions and there is some decisions you have to make! Multiplayer: Well the multiplayer is **** garbage.. The weapon mods makes no sense, and there is alot of them, and most of them are pointless. Compared to MW this game is a downgrade. Buy this game at sale.. like i did, and sometimes when i need to torture myself i grind some weapons for warzone! The campaign is surprisingly the best part of this game.. I cant judge zombie mode because i never play that part of the game."
203,Stasimus,"Dec 30, 2020",0,"Skilled based matching is making game no fun to play, because it’s imbalanced and not designed to be played strongly competitive. Shady SBMM system knowns before the round starts whom will win. Maps, respawn system and kill streaks are designed to add extra random factor into game to make all kid in the lobby close to 1. Additionally aim resist is a new technic to balance you if your are doing well in current match, as well as hidden bugs and glitches."

208,CoD_sucks_cock,"Jan  1, 2021",0,"People often contribute the general despair and hopelessness of 2020 on the coronavirus, and understandably so. However, 2020 has been one of the worst years on record because of the release of CoD Cold War. Scholars and historians have already been equating this backyard prison abortion of a  title to the holocaust, however they unanimously agree that it is 10x worse in scale and scope. The world health organization declared a global emergency as a result of the cancer that spawned from the release of this title. If given the option to win a million dollars with the contingency that I have to play call of duty cold war for one hour a year or get punched in the cock repeatedly by mike tyson with brass knuckles, I'd gladly chose the latter. I envy the deaf and the blind that weren't exposed to the plague that is the call of duty franchise. If Helen Keller were alive today, she would go down as the luckiest woman in the planet for her natural immunity to the call of duty franchise. Only those who were fluent in braille would be able to tell her that her mom sucks massive cock on the weekends. In conclusion, while driving home from work I pray for a head on collision in oncoming traffic so I can never be forced to look at a call of duty title. I award this game no points, and may god have mercy on our souls."
209,Wicell,"Jan  2, 2021",0,"I have not been this disappointed in a Call of Duty game since Ghosts. 2019's Modern Warfare was a breath of fresh air, it went back to the roots and delivered a fast paced shooter requiring skill, communication, and strategizing to come of on top. Black Ops Cold War does none of that. It went back to the old arcade feeling Overwatch skin-over, without the tactics of Overwatch. The Zombies mode is also lackluster; after completing the Easter egg once, there's no joy in trying to do it again, it doesn't create fun moments and challenges like some of the older Zombies modes did. If you enjoyed Modern Warfare, you will not enjoy this game."

Game suffers from issues that were fixed and not even present in Call of duty: Modern Warfare. I'm rating it a 2 because the campaign was fun and enjoyable, but short, and zombies is there but really bare compared to other COD games."
212,Lukrejshyn,"Feb 25, 2021",6,"The game is mediocre. For every thing it does well there's a thing it does horribly bad. The game looks decent, the guns sound and look alright but there's something going on with the optimization. At least for PC version I've heard and experienced sudden FPS drops and bad rendering. I've played the game since day 1 and I have to admit it was really bad then. It got better but there are times where the game feels unplayable. Altough problems people had with crashes has been solved for the most part and the game almost never brakes. The multiplayer is another story, probably the most awaited feature of BOCW for the majority of people that didn't like MW19 multiplayer. It really is a dissapointment. It came back with a call of duty style that series established and made fans fall in love with yet it doesn't change much from a previous entry and at times may even feel like a downgrade. The amazing MW gunsmith type weapon customization has been butchered by a genreic and barely useful attachments. And this is what hurts me the most. Because this especially feels like a downgrade. The maps are controversional. I personally love that they finally stopped going only for formulaic, 3 laned map design. Some people might hate it but I'd rather have unique and thought out maps with a couple of really bad ones than all of them being generic and feel the same. Settings are kind of basic but there's few maps which do well in this category (satelite or miami for example). In terms of guns and balance the game does pretty good. Almost every category of weapons is viable and every player stands on the fair ground. Let's now shift our focus to the ""side modes"". Campaign is amazing. Very unique settings for all the mission. Objectives are unique. You can make unique choices. Another amazing COD campaign which is a great thing. I've always enjoyed playing those first to prepare myself for mutliplayer experience and feel how the game plays. They've put a lot of thought into this story and you can clearly see it. My only complain is how short the campaign is. There's only 9 missions, and that's including only 2 optional mission which you can't attempt unless you collected certain things throughout other missions. Zombies are amazing. it's a completely new take on a Zombies mode. It feels like a reboot to be honest. For some people it might not be what they were looking for because it completely changes the old cod zombies formula. It's run and gun mode which I understand some people might find tedious rather than enjoyable. But I myself had a lot of fun with it and it's probably the best part of the whole game. There's a lot more objectives to be done than in previous games and you can acutally create your own class. In summary is the game bad? I wouldn't say so. Is the game great? Wouldn't say that either. It does things well and bad. It also depends. If you're going to play all modes including zombies, campaign and mutliplayer then yeah go for it. But if you're only interested in multiplayer then you'll be better off just buying MW or waiting for the next game. Thanks for reading."

216,Kekonor,"Jan 17, 2021",0,"The Singleplayer, **** great, dont get me wrong, but OH BOY the MP...literally the worst i ever played. Firstly: Maps suck. There are maybe 4 maps that are good, half of which are returning maps like Nuketown and Raid. Gamemodes besides the standard quickplay modes are trash. Who wants to play VIP? Should be renamed to ""Camp"", likewise with Dirty Bomb, which should be ""Camp on a big map"". Oh, did i mention Camping? Yeah you can lierally only camp, because well...either youre getting sniped (Snipers are pretty OP) or killed by a shotgun on like 150 meter. Then, we have weapons in general...not much to say here, you got a sniper-lmg, a assault rifle-smg, a MP that shootes farther than a sniper...just COD-standard. Perks...theres only perk greed, then you take the perks which make grenades and tactical grenades useless, then youre good to go. Scorestreaks are nothing out of the ordinary. The Maps have a weird tendency to just spawnswitch 1 or 2 persons, making them spawn with all enemys, OR, if your spawn is being camped, its not switching at all! Again mapdesign sucks! The games then crashes frequently, framedrops, etc. Just a 2020 game, buggy and unfinished. Wallhacks are abundant, i got lobbys that had hackers frequently, like killing the whole lobby, seeing through things, lagswitches are back(?what the f?), aimbots, etc. Then they start to patch things. Making some weapons worse over night, changing matchmaking (making it even worse). When im done leveling the Battle-Pass season 1, i will uninstall this piece of trash.

222,Spitfiringdork,"Jan 30, 2021",0,"First off, the campaign was short and not challenging.. even if it was entertaining and or fun. Zombies is fun for a bit.. but certainly overhyped by treyarch. Lastly, multiplayer is the be all end all in a cod game.. and it is a disaster.. if you enjoy it.. well good for you. You're the 0.05% of gamers that like it, I put in a few prestige levels and over 24hours played and have over a 1.6 kd (Like any other cod for me). I can honestly say that it is clunky and not fun. MW can be a bit campy... I like to run and gun like anyone else, but it plays smooth and the weapon options and playstyles are endless. Destroy cold war please, we need activision to get their act together because Battlefield is coming back to the party with what I hope is a well developed game. Infinity Ward is No.1 FAR AND AWAY. Thank you"
223,BeardedWaffle,"Feb 18, 2021",0,"Where do you start with this?, I could call this a cash grab but it's worse than that. Honestly, take a look at the positive 'critic' reviews and how full of BS they are(majority). Then the user reviews, people need to stop buying into the hype of 'Call of duty"". The franchise died a while ago and this is the end result. So I love to snipe, this game has made it damn near un-enjoyable to snipe. I get 5 kills in quick succession for a clip and I get massive score boosts. I'll be on say 20 kills but have 4k points... yet the reg gunners at the top with 50 kills.. have the same?. Add SBMM to my unnaturally high score per minute and we have sweaty heaven!!. My lobbies feel unplayable, I've got guys smoking lanes to cross.. in PUBS!!. It's madness. I'm good at the game and can easily get a decent KD but I don't want to sweat or do any of that. This game funnels you into a narrow route of, ""if you don't sweat this game, you'll lose"" and the lobbies are just no where near balanced. I feel so bad for younger people, when i was 14 I played MW2 and that's a call of duty game!. You should be able to sit down and relax, ye maybe have a bad game or maybe a couple but you should be able to pop off now and again!. We have this attitude that we need to give everyone a reward and be fair to all!. It's madness, reward those who put the effort and time in, make people WANT to improve themselves. The old Call of duty had a perfect formula and it could still work, greed and money will kill this franchise off. Do not buy this game whatever you do, biggest waste of time."
224,smint007,"Feb 22, 2021",0,"TLDR: Game is riddled with bugs, poor gameplay and scummy monetisation design choices all aimed to squeeze as much money out of players as possible. The game that killed COD for me. MW had plenty of issues but the gunplay was great. I had high hopes for CW but from bugs to gameplay issues to poor design choices I'm done with the franchise.  And this is all thanks to Activi$ion and the devs. Bugs Galore.I can think of 5 bugs just in the menus alone - Post game breakdowns sometimes don't load, glitches in the gun attachment screen, challenges sometimes dont track, glitches preventing parties from joining a game. Even graphical overlay slop that sometimes covers text. It's a sloppy, amateur mess. All indicative of a terrible rush job of a dev cycle and total lack of care. If the devs can't even program the menu's properly what hope do they have with the actual game. Activi$ion rake in billions from this franchise and they cant even hire devs to fix the menus. Missing content described as free season content.This disgusting practice means you pay full price and get an incomplete game. On release 6 multiplayer maps, a short campaign. Critical missing features like the ability to save custom gun blueprints are still missing. No doubt we'll get the rest of the game soon but marketed by Activi$ion as ""free"" content.  Absolutely disgusting. SBMMActivi$ion not content on making a billion dollars (What's better than a billion? Billions). Pushed hard for an ultra aggressive SBMM. The theory is newbies will have an easier time as they are supposedly matched to players of equal skill. The easier it is for newbies to get into the game. And the more attractive the game is the more people will buy the game and the more money Activi$ion make from micro transactions. This theory then invades the rest of the game design choices like ultra aggressive aim assist for pad players so they can compete with PC players. Then there's the map design - plenty of camping spots because supposedly that's what newbies like to do. It is not enjoyable to walk into a room scan all 101 possible camping locations but then dying because you didn't scan the 102nd camping location.  Rinse and repeat as you run through the map.  It is a chore to play half these maps. There's a reason why the old maps are so beloved and the devs know this but do they care? Nope, they already have your money and Activi$ion wants the $$$. I have no issue catering to new players but what they have done here is at the detriment of the game as a whole. Dishonourable mentions go to:Poor visibility - I cannot see s*** half the time! But hey it helps the newbies camp.Scorestreaks - Good system yet implemented so poorly that players are rewarded for killing more than they do for playing the map objective. So NO ONE plays the objective. Thanks Activi$ion and Treyarch I hope your franchise rots to pieces."

Then no server browser, which degrades this game to a disgusting console port. Then, largely due to the missing server browser, endless queues if you dont want aim assisted console players in your matches. In short, I greatly regret having tried another COD after all those years.

244,cjnichols17,"Dec 17, 2020",4,"From the beginning this game seems promising. Once again maps will be free, the cold war setting is actually semi interesting,  and you know the gunplay will be smooth. The campaign starts out pretty good. I actually caught myself stopping to admire my surroundings in many of the areas. Multiplayer started off feeling pretty smooth as well. The problems set in when you remember that this is a Call of Duty game and for every step forward they take they either refuse to fix an old issue, improve outdated mechanics, or just shoot themselves in the foot with **** like their overly aggressive skill based match making. Skill Based Match Making or SBMM for short is a novel idea. Setting players up against other players of a similar skill level seems fair enough. However the issue sets in when the lobbies take forever to find players of a similar skill level, you get good enough to be in lobbies where everyone has to be perspiring profusely 24/7, and all the fun of playing around with new guns is thrown out the window. Instead you get players constantly camping to move ahead and sticking to predetermined metas. When everyone is using the same handful of weapons with the exact same builds the game's sense of wonder and exploration in its mechanics quickly falls apart. I quickly found myself in lobbies where playing aggressively even started being punished as full teams would post up in one spot and snipe you from a head glitch. Head glitching is yet another issue. It is the weird phenomenon in the older games where when you crouch next to a wall only your forehead can be seen over the wall. Yet somehow the gun behind the wall can still shoot you with no decrease in damage from shooting through the concrete wall or decreased accuracy from being shot through that same wall. Instead the developers have decided to act like this is some pro level skill only long time players and pros can pull off. When in reality it is just some horse **** that they refused to fix when it originally showed up in like Call of Duty 2 back in  2005. Yeah over 15 years ago. Let's continue now into the spawns and overall connectivity. For years Call of Duty games have given players this weird peaks and valleys gameplay. Where sometimes you feel like you are on some god like streak and then the next 5 games its like your bullets mid magezine turn into blanks. Maybe every 3 or 4 rounds just doesn't hit. Then you have the shot guns that supposedly have bullet spread, yet can't get your a hit marker when the enemy is trying to drink from the end of your barrel like the shotgun is a straw in their favorite big gulp beverage after they spent 3 days with no water in the desert. Instead shot guns are now expected to be used like sniper riffles forcing you to have precision aim as if bullet spread doesn't truly exist. If we are going for this approach to shot guns then distance allowed for a one hit kill and consistency in bullet damage should be taken into consideration right? Nah... Snipers suffer from a similar inconsistency where at times you will blast someone in the head and receive no hit marker what so ever. Other times you feel like your shot is way off and hitting way too low on the opponents hit box that it couldn't in any way actually hit them. Yet, bang, there is your one hit kill. Last, but not least the spawns. I can not count how many times I would be walking out of the spawn only to get shot in the back as the spawns swapped at the exact moment I got to pop back into existence. I understand being flanked, but this was just a spawn swap inconsistency. Yet similarly I have also had countless times of walking through a large open space, turning to go the other way, and somehow magically an enemy is right behind me. As if they were there the whole time. Yet no enemy was on my screen or caught on my UAV. I know there are perks to stop the UAV from picking up your position. However, the frequency of this happening within my experiences and the way it was happening further tells me that something on the networking end for the game is not quite keeping up pace regardless of my high end PC's capabilities and fairly speedy internet. Long story short; TLDR. I think revisiting this time period was a smart choice as the future and modern aesthetic of these games has just, become bland. It was a back drop for the story and nothing else. The Cold War timing and theming is just more interesting and novel. Graphically this may not be a powerhouse, but has its moments of beauty and wonder within the campaign. Sadly that didn't carry over well into the multiplayer section where maps once again feel so cluttered and haphazard. They play alright, flow isn't bad, mechanics just hinder the experience, and the clutter tends to make every map feel like the developers were rushed and didn't know how best to fill the space. Other than theming and beauty of some of the environments within the campaign the game is just another Call of Duty."

Black Ops 1 is the best Call of Duty game in my opinion other than maybe Modern Warfare 2 and World at War. The maps suck and the gameplay sucks as well.

252,BL3Review,"Dec 16, 2020",1,"Before I begin, let me just say I purchased the game 3 hours ago and already refunded the game on release of season 1. Ho boy, let start with my very first impression after installing the multiplayer. So Christmas themed Nuketown and Raid had JUST released when I hopped on and IMMEDIATELY the update released without the actual maps being included for PC players, kicking them out of every game they joined on the new maps (Zed 398 Swift Clover error). Already an AWFUL start, so I tried the base game maps and loaded into Miami domination and the side with the pool was ATROCIOUS. I went from 170+ fps with an i9-9900k and 2080 to 4 fps when even looking in the direction of the spawn with the pool area, in fact it crashed my entire pc. Afterwards I tried zombies and it wasn't anything like the trailers led me to believe it would be, in a bad bad way. The zombies mode in that game felt like a souped up version of the side modes in BO4 zombies which also wasn't good. It feels more like an first person version of Dead Ops than an actual Treyarch zombies mode, even AW zombies was a better mode in delivering a zombies experience. The actual guns in the game are a MAJOR downgrade from Modern Warfare, everything sounds the same and like plastic and don't look nearly as good as their MW counterparts. They also feel fairly weak, they don't feel or sound like they have any power behind any shots even when using a shotgun. The only reason I gave this game a 1/10 is that it actually successfully booted up on my PC."
253,Klenerschluchti,"Oct 10, 2021",6,"Its CoD like every year more or less though for me originally the interest came with the zombie mode when the first advertised outbreak in season 2 which was something new a fresh to the zombie mode which has been present in many of the Black Ops games. Long story short if you like the zombie modes then i can recommend this one since it really has a lot of Innovation this time around together with a full progression system, as for the campaign, its big and flashy and kinda weird but overall fun for a few hours certainly not the worst campaign in CoD history. Now the biggest part most people play CoD, the multiplayer.I didnt play much of it and from what i saw and i dont think i will play it again any times soon.While the movement is fun and fast paced unlike MW 2019 there are just so many issues with itcrashes, instability both client sided and server sided even months after release, still struggles with hackers and glitchers, the weapons are unbalanced as there are a handful that stick out as being the best and the rest most of the time is utterly useless and that new SBMM system only works half the time seeming more random then calculated based on stats. Overall this is not a great example of a CoD MP, i would wait for the new one or go back to the older ones before it unless you are only in it for the zombies."

Niestety cała gra chodzi na starym silniku, co względem Call of Duty Modern Warfare (2019) jest sporym downgradem i niestety to widać... Przede wszystkim mechanika strzelania wydaje się być znacznie bardziej drewniana, efekty wizualne jak mgła, zamieć, chmura gazu wyglądają dosyć podstarzale, pewne ubytki widać też w samej grafice i modelach. Z drugiej strony optymalizacja jest bardzo dobra. Brakuje mi tylko większej ilości map, które zaczną pojawiać się wraz z kolejnymi sezonami. Liczę, że tryb zombie dostanie kilka nowych miejsc wraz z nadejściem 1 sezonu battle passa, bo jedna mapa zombie to trochę za mało. Oprócz tego zdarzają się też sporadyczne glitche, które szybko znikają za sprawą patchy. Sumarycznie nie jest to zła gra, ale nadal wymaga sporego dopracowania i uzupełnienia o dodatkowy content.

265,JonoroHattori,"Nov 24, 2020",6,"Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War has a lot of potential, but it was wasted for 2 main reasons, 1) Because Treyarch had a year less to develop the game and 2) Because of the SBMM, the truth is that maps are acceptable (except Miami) since at least they are better than the ones in MW (2019), and their gameplay is not bad, it removes a bit of the realism of the gameplay of MW (2019) but at the same time gives more frenzy to the game, but to be honest, I am sad to see what tremendous potential there is wasted because of Activision and forcing Treyarch to put the SBMM ruining the gaming experience, so in short, the game has a good campaign and a good Zombies mode, but if you play Call of Duty for multiplayer, this game is not for you since the only good thing it brings is the Dirty Bomb mode and that in my opinion is not enough for you to spend 60 dollars just for multiplayer, If you prefer the campaign, the Zombies and Dirty Bomb mode could be worth the purchase, but if you prefer Multiplayer, this game is not worth it at all"

And the trolls that play this trash can of a game are not less funny. Call of Duty needs to take their shooter serious or just stop pumping garbage out of their studios. We NEED a solid competitor to put this dead cow to pasture....

Also, snipers are way too strong. one shot to the foot kills in this game when nothing but a head shot should be a one hit kill. There are a LARGE, LARGE amount of bugs multiple weeks into the game being released in multiplayer and zombies. This game is extremely unbalanced and needs a lot of work before it is worth anywhere near $60."

272,SG72,"Apr 11, 2021",1,"This game is a cynical cash grab by the developers. The GUI has all the polish of a mobile game, cluttered, confusing and difficult to navigate. On brand for the mobile game experience is the constant notifications for micro transactions selling useless skins. The audio engineer clearly lost his hearing some time ago, no matter which setting you select it is muffled and feels like you have cotton wool in your ears. To compliment this sound effects jarringly clip in and out with noticeable distortion. The gun attachments are lazy and mostly useless copy pastes with no thought or difference put into the configurations. The gunplay and shooting mechanics feel dated and hit registry feels like a lottery. The game is riddled with bugs from launch that are not being fixed yet they continue to push out updates for stuff that makes them money. The integration with Warzone is a waste of time, who knows why they bothered adding it to the title screen, launching to the join Warzone from this takes so long you might as well put the kettle on. My 1 point for this game goes to the marketing team that persuaded me to buy this steaming pile of turd."

It's totally unfinished peace of **** Are they really that greedy??!? Campaign was fine and graphics looks good but come 'on other is totally **** asswipingly bad.Lack of maps. Lack of guns. Lack of balance with them. Lack of AI. Lack of Bots. Lack of modes. Lack of **** everything but bugs. Waste of money. Waste of time. I hope they still can fix this and make us fans believe again.

Sometimes friends cannot join my games or i cannot join theirs. Or the game just stutters for no reason (ryzen 3700x,with 48gb ram and a 2080ti) so that should not make it stutter... i still dont know why they did remove the server method also for multiplayer gaming like they did back in COD 4: Modern Warfare, that worked great and stopped those damn cheaters from joining (or they'd be banned)."
276,Pixelflow,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"Well, i started since closed alpha on ps4, then closed beta on ps4 and finaly closed beta on pc.The game has barely changed since, same maps with a small addition (+2 maps) for a total of 5 maps on normal mp. The game feels like a bad joke, sbmm is heavy and you must sweat all the time, campers are in a immense number, spawn camping is a huge thing on every map (just like shipment in mw, you respawn you die). Weapons and not balanced in any way, mp5 has similar range to a max sniper and ar weapons have lower range then a pistol. THE GAME IS FILLED WITH CHEATERS SINCE LAUNCH...AIMBOTS AND WALLHACKERS are present in 1 out of 7-8 games. There are plenty of bugs, from missing icons on challenges to off map exploits to lag/disconnect to crashes. Do not buy it, it's not worth it, even with a 70-80% discount. They sold a pre-alpha game with 0 content, 0 anti cheats and a ton of 0 interes from the dev team. Stay away, i beg you, do not make the same mistake. Stay away...stay away...stay away....stay away."

278,Rudu,"Nov 29, 2020",3,"Where to start.. this game is clearly unfinished as it's become a reoccurrence year after year. Problem you have with call of duty is that the casual audience which makes up majority of the market do not care about the game, whereas people who care about call of duty, can never get their voices heard. This game has a huge problem, it's not with Skill based matchmaking, it's performance based matchmaking. Skill based matchmaking would enable to increase your skill gradually as you encounter repetitive challenge, but with call of duty, you play a great game and then you get shredded in the next. When you do well you begin to wonder, am I doing well because I'm getting better or am I doing well because the game inherently put me in an easier lobby? Activision has done a great job at removing any sense of competitive integrity. This game is a complete mess, the developers are just corporate puppets to the shareholders. What a shame. A franchise that I have invested a huge part of my life has come to this."
279,Piechy,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"Campaign-The campaign had a couple of fun and interesting missions, just not enough to really get the user submerged within the story. Woods and Mason seem to barely remember anything that had previously happened and their interactions with Hudson and each other made them seem that they met about 2 weeks ago rather then the years of operations experience that they wouldve had. Dialogue was fake and sparse, and voice acting didnt live up to the expectations that were created by leaving James C Burns out of the picture. Story was an utter let down after the measly 2.5 hr campaign storyline. Multiplayer-I'm giving this game a 0. Its a complete step back when compared to MW 2019. Animations are from BO4 and 2010 BO1. Gunsmith is a cheap and lazy knockoff of MW2019. Least amount of content released upon launch in COD history.  Servers are poor and dated back to B02 days. Gunfights seem rng luck at best. Deadsilence is back and completely decimates anyone used to MW deadsilence. Sleight of hand is not within the game so you have to grind to max weapon level to unlock the magazine that includes improved weapon reload speeds. First field upgrade that you're given is a proximity mine................WHY THE F#*%$!!!!!!!! T3arc did well in removing claymores from MP but they left a proximity mine as a field upgrade. Graphics are clear but there is a serious step back with the treyarc filter as compared to MW. Operators are color bleached with the environment so its very difficult to see enemies (they knew this because there are flashlight weapon attachments). Head-glitching and corner camping are at an all time high within MP. So to all those people that said Treyarc doesn't promote camping, F#*(K off."

Poor game performance despite huge PC specs. Expensive, insipid, vapid, grindy, flawed, ill-conceived, unpolished, dreary and characterless. This would be worth £15 as a stand alone game, but because of the COD model, every sub-par installment is a genuine waste of time and money as the game is irrelevant when the next installment is released.

286,TOBISCUITSX,"Dec  2, 2020",1,"The content that is available is good, The multiplayer maps and content are good (except cartel), The current Zombies map is good however i would have like to see more zombies maps. 1 is not enough for a launch title.  ive put in 100 hours so far and the lack of content is clear. I am also a pc player, the skill based matchmaking is ridiculous. in solo queues i get full console lobbies. but when i queue with my friend i get enemies who have over a 100 levels on me (who have superior weapons ) There is also a noticeable difference in the skill quality of the enemies. The auto aim is ridiculous for controller player they have aim bot. This is incredible frustrating to get killed by as you know the opponent has no skill. This coupled with unbalanced weapons such as the spaz12 shotgun and the one burst tactical riffles. This lead to engagement where you lose simply because you have the wrong gun, not by skill difference  or outplay potential. Die Maschine is a good map incorporating parts of Nact der Undertoten from previous Cods, however after already investing 75+ hours on one map it is starting to get boring, I have Completed the Easter Egg multiple times as well as reached round 58 as my personal best.

Like most cods, you're forced to use a small selection of guns or you'll get beamed by anyone using the aug or ak47. The guns take forever to rank up and by the time its ranked up they nerf it.

324,nOpeOn,"Dec 19, 2020",1,"An authentic **** Impossible to play multiplayer! The guns, the maps, everything is unbalanced. A disaster. And the Warzone combined feels like we don´t want mess the two distint guns and games. I´m sad and i want my money back"
325,Whatar,"Dec 19, 2020",0,"Thank you for damaging modern warfare activision, good **** marketing move, skip this one guys. Do it for bo4, do it for cold war, do it for better games."
326,Ohsnapsitspaul,"Dec 19, 2020",1,Played the multiplayer for about 10 hours. This game feels like spun garbage. You come from Modern Warfare and it’s superb gun play to this arcade clunky crap that looks and feels like it was made in 2011. I have a 3080 and am running on Max setting. Still looks like garbage. Should’ve copied the code base and engine for modern warfare and put a twist on it.Do not recommend spending any money on this **** game.
327,Vertigo3030,"Aug 17, 2021",0,"The game is unplayable. Can not get into a game that is starting fresh. Only get put into games that are completely one sided, only get put into hopeless to win matches because Activision doesn't have pride in anything they make. All due to developer incompetance."
328,EntryLevel,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"One of the best Call of Duty games in long time. It had kind of bad launch, but it's way better now. Can't wait for COD 2021, hopefully WW 2 !!!"
329,thepainisreal,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"BEST Call of Duty in year. Oh my my god, why is it so underrated. It's so well made game. Thank you EA."
330,ataman808,"Mar 31, 2021",0,(i`m not an eng speaking man) COD cold war is the first COD i`ve ever bought. Multiplayer is interesting but Treyarch has forgotten about balance of guns and levels of players. Singleplayer isn`t so good for price but i like it.For result we have:positive-graphics-interesting multiplayer-ballanced gadgets-50/50 campaignnegative-price-balance of guns and players levels-short plot(i could forgot something)over 7-8/10

333,FrankThe_Tank,"Apr 17, 2021",6,The bad - The game like every Cod came out a buggy mess with a poorly balanced multiplayer that has almost no content but is still priced at 60 dollars. The campaign on pc is unplayable since the evidence board crashes the game and there is not way to fix it. The multiplayer also has a strict sbmm system that wasn't as harsh during the beta for cold war (which was fun as hell btw dkw they downgraded it on release)The good - (note i don't play zombies so this isn't a review of zombies.) The campaign of this game kicks ass. It has bugs but if you experience the game without them its amazing. I think the campaign is just as good no better than black ops 2 which was previously the best campaign in the series now beaten just a bit by cold war. I feel like this is a decent game without the bugs but you just can't overlook the **** multiplayer.
334,TheRareGamer,"Apr 24, 2021",0,"The only positive thing about this game are the Zombies, it pales in comparison to MW's multiplayer..."
335,MicroChip177,"Apr 28, 2021",6,i still not get it sometimes i start screaming because first this game is horrible not optimized for pc poor pc portsecond the multiplayer its a horrible it look like cod black ops 3 with reskin of cold warthird weapons and characters are bad compare to mw 2019 that game was fantastic compare to this game special  in pc when the trailer droped i sweer i pre order it in the first min because i was thinking that mw 2019 is fantastic that mean the new cod will be the best but when the game release i got a **** port in pc and bad graphics in my console first i said i will give the devs a time to update there game engine or fixing there game for all treyarch i do respact u but it seem like u betrayed my trust in u guys  it been a 3 full seasons and your game is still broken bad characters movement every thing is horrible some times the texture flickering i have a powerfull pc that mean the game should run better than my 10 tflops console or u dont care about pc players ? I sweer guys if u took the worst cod multiplayer infinite warfare and if u compare it with this i sweer cod iw have more detail than this now i lost all my hopes with this game it will never be fixed i was hoping that this game never release and infinity wards devs continue there job by updating mw 2019 with new content every warzone season but who i blameits activision mistake The only thing that the devs do it right is a fun zombies game better than black ops 4 in my opinion i will give it 6 points for good short story and a great zombies mode cod should never deserve the full price
336,Twibbie,"May  2, 2021",5,"Sonys paytowin oferta !!!!No ser excusado en un juego multiplataforma.En comparación con otros CoD, la menor cantidad de mapas MP al principio. Tanto camping como en MW pero menos movimiento. Cod Black OPs se siente como si hubiera pedido MW a voluntad."
337,CptCreeper,"Aug 21, 2021",7,"I enjoyed this game. Campaign was just so kick ass. I played it after a big launch though, that's why i've enjoyed it, because on launch there were so many stability issues.Campaign 8/10Multiplayer 6/10Zombies 7/10"
338,Gathios,"May  3, 2021",3,"Concept art and environments: Nice!: --- Operators: Some are pretty good, like Adler, Woods, Park, Wraith... others.. IDK --- Campaign: Nice! -- Zombie mode: Nice! -- Multiplayer: Awful! ( Unbalanced maps, poor guns variety, hellish re spawn system, and the movement mechanics feels like a step back on the saga)... MW still better in my opinion."
339,drklwo39,"Jun 23, 2021",0,"This game is absolute garbage. Shoot first die first, unbalanced weapons, and garbage hit detection. This game is a steaming pile of doodoo dick **** 0 content,  and the maps are trash. Half the maps are remakes, and on top of that, everyone camps. SBMM ruins connection, which results in shoot first die first and garbage hit reg. the fact that meta critic rated it the number it did blows my mind. MW 2019 MP is garbage too, but at least the game had content, good graphics, and decent hit reg. Game also had an amazing campaign. Sad pile of garbage. hope treyarch, along with activision goes under."
340,Affenzahn,"Jun 26, 2021",0,Worst game ever.... **** you Activision and stick your SBMM up your worthless ass!
341,dreysi,"Jul  2, 2021",0,I finally made a metacritic account for this game alone. Buggy unfinished cash grab! So glad I didn't buy this (unless you count a GPU code as buying). After the last COD I thought the series would be good but this is your typical on rails 2005 crud. Do NOT spend money on  this chossy cash in game. After putting in 8 hours I'll go back to the old one thanks.
342,MMM967,"Jul 26, 2021",0,"Santo dios de la virgen, se creía imposible que Activision pudiera hacerlo peor, y coño lo han logrado con este juego, (no llega ni a juego de lo roto que esta). Que mentes brillantes de la oficina de treyarch se les ocurrió ponerlo gold a esta pre-alpha de modern warfare reskineado? -Una campaña mezcla sigilo con tiros a saco, que las decisiones no cuentan para el final (si de todas formas la única decisión que influye es al final de la trama). -Rendimiento pésimo en pc, da igual que tengas la rtx 2080 y un procesador i7 de 9 gen, si te va ha dar tirones y te va ha chupar lo que no está escrito. -El multijugador o mas bien simulador de mods menú donde te inflan a través de las paredes, donde esta el anticheat treyarch? -El Zombies mas reciclado de la historia en cuanto mapas, por dios outbreak es el copiar y pegar de los mapas de bomba sucia en multi, además de esos mapitas cuenta gotas que nos llegan cada x tiempo. -Por dios el puto cargador del shader, cada parche que ponen me tiro 20 minutos para poder entrar a la lobby. Queréis parchear que cada vez que inicio el juego esta a 200% el volumen, desde modern warfare spin off esta ese bug de sonido y no hay manera humana de que lean el feedback? Conclusión para Activision Blizzard Candy Crush S.A: no saques mas Cod's cada 6 meses, deja respirar a la saga unos 5 años como mínimo. Centrate en Modern warfare spin off que lo tienes abandonado el pobre (no me vengáis con el cuento de que warzone cuenta), y cod mobile."
343,Neilnez3,"Jul 27, 2021",0,"This game whilst seems graphically good quality, there are many issues regarding fluidity and gameplay. This game will crash many times and you will have to do 10 different fixes which still may not work. The game is over 100gb and has large updates every week and issues with downloading shaders consistently. Even with updated software the game will be buggy and do not be surprised if the game crashes with no explanation. When the game is working it is fun but for a casual gamer, this game is not for you. Do not buy this if you are thinking of playing ever so often. All other games on all other platforms work completely fine but this game seems to have the most issues and is why the user reviews are predominately negative. These fixes will unfortunately be fixed due to the large international corporation and the amount of money they make on consumers."
344,Mogull,"Aug  5, 2021",0,"Game is barely functional, constantly crashes with known memory leak issues since day 1 that are still not resolved and when it does finally work after 15 minutes of trying to boot it up here's what you get: Campaign: who the **** cares, you're not playing cod for a campaign, there are games on the market like doom, ultrakill, dusk, amid evil that **** on call of duty in every single aspect when it comes to level design, shooting mechanics and soundtrack, nobody has cared about a cod campaign since 2010 when the first black ops dropped Multiplayer: far too many attachments on guns that change little to nothing, half the perks are useless and builds have no variety. The game has some of the worst maps in cod history, miami barely runs properly and is a giant open square with half the map being unused, satellite is a giant open field with 1 flank route that isn't covered by snipers, checkmate is a map to rival stonehaven for contender for worst map, it's a giant open warehouse with a small tube in the middle, it looks awful, plays awful and is an insult to level designers around the world. Zombies: Easily the weakest zombies experience to date, you start absolutely kitted out with a weapon of your choosing that can usually last you until you get the power on on any map, early rounds of zombies used to be some of the most tense, having to use a combination of a weak pistol with 3 mags and a knife to survive, now there's almost no tension in the hardest part of the game. As of writing this I have played about 20 hours of zombies and have died once, you are given so much hp, so much armour, so many outs with the field upgrades that the only danger is not killing all the zombies quick enough at extraction which leads to a hilarious cutscene of a zombie with a ****ing rocket launcher blowing up your escape helicopter. There are no characters anymore in zombies, there are operators, the publisher/developer's greed has lead them down a path of trying to pawn off different cosmetics to the point where now the story isn't one that we experience through the map and people we play as, but rather one we watch from afar through cutscenes and some of the most tedious unrewarding easter eggs. On top of this the maps seem to be aimed at the old zombies fans, the ones who liked simple maps like kino and der reise where you set up in 5 minutes and just spend ages training around an easy map, there's nothing for veterans, nothing for the fans who got invested in the zombies story and gameplay, there's nothing for the people who buy cod solely for zombies The wonder weapons are some of the dullest, navagating the pack a punch UI is worse than just dropping a weapon in and training for 5 seconds, playing for longer than an hour on a map will cause the framerate to drop to"
345,fvuckthisgame,"Aug  9, 2021",0,"I left the game in the beta with level 10 and a k/d of 1.90, a couple of months later (I mean this week) I bought the game to give it a try, the worst thing I did. In my first game they already paired me with masters prestige and not a single normal level, at least all prestige. I have played about 6h with a k/d of 1.60 and I can confirm that this is the worst COD I have ever played in my life, I have not enjoyed a single minute of the game, only playing extremely competitively to make decent games. This game is so bad and it has pissed me off so much that this is the first time I have commented on something on this forum just to vent.  C - A - N - C - E - R"
