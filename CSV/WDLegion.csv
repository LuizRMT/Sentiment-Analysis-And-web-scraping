1,frver,"Nov  6, 2020",10,"Довольно солидная игра, но в то же время ничего особенного. Надеюсь, у dlc есть история получше или что-то в этом роде. Я бы не хотел одновременно жаловаться, потому что это вообще весело и с технической точки зрения все работает достаточно хорошо."
2,txt203,"Nov  7, 2020",9,"Idk why anyone would hate it, it's not earth-shattering, but it's nonetheless very cool open world hacking game. I mean i would understand someone giving it 6 or 7 for technical problems, but flat out zeros make no sense."
3,futureawaits,"Nov  7, 2020",9,"More of this and less of whatever watch dogs 2 was supposed to be. This one is already huge improvement, can't wait what they do with watch dogs 4. Please another European city. Anything but USA at this point. Usa has been done so many time in different games, there's other places too. Even Australia would be better choice than USA."
4,beforeourtime,"Nov  7, 2020",9,"Whoever says it's ""most buggiest game they have ever played"" must be lying. I'm serious. I have played over 10 hours and i have hardly countered ANY bugs at all. It's literally impossible that i'm having amazing experience and someone else plays EXACTLY SAME GAME IN SAME STATE and they say it's buggiest thing ever. Makes absolutely no sense. I refuse to believe that. i can't believe people are so desperate to down vote new games that they make stuff up to hurt the game."
5,Isamu78,"Nov  2, 2020",8,"Easily the best watch dogs in the series, overall gameplay has been refined nicely.  The permadeath feature adds more to the game than i expected, even trivial encounters like ramming a police car become life and death.  When you know you wont just end up with a fine or an injury, you may loose a rare character, you tend to play differently.  The learning curve may be painful at times as nothing sucks more than doing several missions to play a character only to get him/her killed before you learn how to play them.  If you stick with the game you will find another recruit later that is as good or at least a variation of the one you lost, but that is little consolation when you ram an exploding barrel on accident and die instantly (or worse, loose a character to a gameplay glitch). This game is a solid 8 and would be a 9 if it was released with more polish.  I have noticed a few bugs... lost a little progress here and there, but it was to the types of things that you KNOW will get fixed in future patches.  There is great variety in the citizens of the city, each being a potential recruit (even the bad guys).  Each character I have spent any time doing missions with has sounded and looked very different although I suspect the thick accents make that easier for them. The tech tree and progression have been slimmed down, and some gadgets are so overpowered than you end up never using some of the others (I am looking at you, spiderbot!).  Still, hacking cargo drones to ride like surfboards is fun.  So is putting a turret on top of your car and driving around, and so are countless other combinations of mechanics. If you are a fan of earlier Watch Dogs games than this is a must-have.  If you want a GTA clone with a few new mechanics, it is worth a buy.  If you intend to play this game without permadeath (characters get sent to hospital for 'x' hours) then i would say there may not be enough new types of things to keep your attention.  It would still be a good game, but it would be a generic GTA knockoff to be picked up on sale."
6,shado8w,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"From technical standpoint it's fine, still could use some patches. Graphically nothing special, not bad either. Story is weak. True standout is hacking and character recruitment. I'm hopeful that dlc's story makes it more interesting. Wait for sale."
7,hellorheaven,"Nov  7, 2020",9,"Okay this is next level comedy. Account that is part of last of us 2 downvoting (botting) accuses Ubisoft that they bot positive reviews? Like are you actually serious and think nobody understands that you are THE actual fake account? Just reading most of these zero reviews all there is just bunch of lies from people who haven't even tried this game and just wanna downvote every new game because they have nothing to do with their sad lives. Most of them are like ""ubisoft sucks, tons of bugs blah blah blah 0 /10"". Thank god on steam you actually need to have game to post reviews. On this site, anyone can just make account and say ""this or that game sucks"" and give zero score. BUT when people ACTUALLY like something, then it must be fake reviews. Because apparently in 2020 you can't like anything. Just lol. No about the game, i absolutely love it. It's nothing incredible, gta v is miles better, but i wasn't expecting that either. I was expecting hacking game and i got it. London was already nice location in Assassin's Creed Syndicate and it works here as well."

9,REGISHiMA,"Nov 10, 2020",8,"A new game that makes you think creatively. A promising problem, but the game has quite a few bugs. Not perfect, but meets the requirements for a 2020 game"
10,timeslikethese,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"What you saw in trailers is what you gonna get. Yeah it doesn't improve that much in terms on ""revolutionary groundbreaking video games"", but it's still solid Watch Dogs game. Recruiting ANYONE mechanic is pretty cool, but London design isn't best imo. They could have just expanded the map and add more rural areas or something. GTA 5 Los Angeles isn't 1 to 1 recreation either, so why should this be. I personally like Watch Dogs 1 map more. Graphics are nice enough. If they actually wanna take this game somewhere, dlc's must be really good. Bringing back Aiden (main character from first game) might be step in right direction. That's literally most exciting for me about this game, that Aiden comes back. Otherwise i'm just waiting for AC Valhalla (seems to be way deeper than this game). Even tho i was kinda aware that Legion wont be anything super-special, so my expectations weren't sky-high. But still better than trash like last of us 2 or marvel's avengers, fallout 76 and so on."
11,discopage,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Honestly pretty solid game, specially considering how weak year 2020 has been for games (so far), last of us (lies) 2 was awful, re 3 remake was 4 hours long speedrunner simulator, doom eternal was fine but nothing special (too much parkour for doom game). So i would say watch dogs legion is fine, but wait for sale. Hopefully they improve it or something. I would put my money rather on assassin's creed valhalla or black ops."
12,fireandwater,"Nov  2, 2020",9,If you don't want some extremely deep lore and just wanna free roam and recruit random npc's then by any means it's worth trying out. No bugs so far.
13,maxlvl99,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"i'm about 20 hours into game and wanted to check metascore and i'm seriously confused what's with all the neagativity and 0 scores??? It's honestly pretty fun game, unlike last of us 2 by developers who made depression simulator 2020."
14,nohardfeelings,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"so far it's just fine. No technical issues so far. I had my expectations really low, so it's actually better than i imagined. Hopefully DLC's will improve it even more."
15,nevrendingstory,"Nov  7, 2020",10,"Красивая игра с открытым миром, с которой можно повеселиться. Не было серьезных ошибок. Не каждая игра должна быть невероятной."
16,roads7tonwhre,"Nov  2, 2020",9,It's fun enough game to mess around with until actual stars of 2020 are coming out like Assassin's Creed Valhalla or Black Ops.
17,Ligh_ght,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Mostly hyped for DLC, but recruit anyone mechanic is cool too. Performance is fine with rtx 2060/2070/2080."
18,Sathurshan30,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"This game gameplay, graphics are awesome, play as any one really worked, every watchdogs fans are should try this game,"
19,petebaldwin,"Nov  2, 2020",8,"29 hours in and I haven't done half of the missions - just been going around, recruiting people and having fun. The game isn't a masterpiece but it's a really cool open world to explore with lots to do and lots of fun to be had. I'd give it a high 7 or a low 8... I've not got a great PC (1660 Super / i5 6402p) but I've had no issues running this. Have a play around with the settings if you're struggling. Mines on medium - high and it looks great and plays well. The whole ""play as anyone"" feature is a blessing and a curse. It's a lot of fun recruiting people and creating your own group but the characters all feel a bit too generic. I keep getting mis-matched voices - a bad-ass looking cage fighter with a super posh accent etc... The perma-death feature makes up for it though as it actually means something to die... Overall, it's a decent game - don't expect it to be something it's not. It's another Watch Dogs game with a few improvements over the last 2 and a few regressions."
20,timofday,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Someone complained that ""put character to the center of screen"" and while i absolutely agree with that and every game should have camera positioning like GTA V, you can actuallychange FOV and put it to 100%. That puts character basically in the center of screen.If you complain about this game, then why not about Ghost of Tsushima? This game had one of the worst camera angles i have experienced in video game. Your character is basically in the very left corner of the screen, it was so awful i couldn't even finish the game. Watch Dogs Legion camera is amazing compared to Ghost of Tsuhsima."
21,shadow264,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Not every game can be masterpiece like supermario okay? It's still fine game, with tons of stuff to do."
22,solid33gaming,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Pretty interesting concept, i'm not saying it's day 1 buy, but on sale? sure"
23,1Hollow,"Nov  7, 2020",10,"Watch Dogs Legion is better than what i expected, reminds me watch dogs 1. Haters logic seems to be: when any new game has bunch of zeros then it's legit score, if it has positive reviews then it must be fake. How sad someone needs to be to even claim something like that, i don't even wanna know. And if anyone wants to claim that my account is fake because i have only 3 reviews, i literally made this account 5 minutes ago to say that this game is fine not horrible. Deal with it."
24,MaxAssassin,"Nov  7, 2020",10,"I swear if this review bombing happens with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, i will personally make Reddit group to gather people to Upvote AC Valhalla with 10 000+ votes. Don't you even dare mess with my favorite games. Legion is decent (nothing special), but it doesn't deserve these zeros from people who never even cared to try it. It's solid 7 out of 10 game. If you have played it for 5 hours and don't like it, that's completely fine and normal, but just downvoting it with zeros is just BS."
25,AwakeandAlive,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"RTX Graphics ? check, Recruit any character? check, driving works? check, Is it London? check,Better than last of us 2? check, Is it fun? check. If someone was waiting for something different then maybe watch trailers or gameplay next time, because they delivered exactly what they promised. It's not perfect, but it's nice and i'm sure dlc's will improve it."
26,thunderaa,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Way better than ps4 story simulators. Worse than first game, but way better than second game."
27,origins77,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"it's exactly what they advetised. If you want true 2020 hits, wait for assassin's creed or black ops."
28,cocacola22,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's pretty cool. Recruit any character you want, dress them up as you want, have fun in the game world, hack cars. It's nothing revolutionary, but i wasn't expecting anything crazy from this game anyway. 100% doesn't deserve these 0-s."
29,vlcplayer,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Watch Dogs 1 is better, but this one is okay. Nothing super special, not awful either. There's way more to do in this open world then for example in mafia 1 remake, so there's that."
30,californiaforev,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"If it came out 5 years ago everyone would praise it to heavens, but it's 2020, so obviously everyone needs to whine their ass off for every new game, unless it's ps4 EXCLUSIVE, then it's masterpiece no matter what lmao."
31,doomete7nal,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Why is everyone so butthurt in 2020? like wtf? and not only with this game, but gaming in general. Bunch of losers who just whine endlessly about every new game, jesus christ. If gaming makes you so angry, maybe get a new hobby or something. Not like gaming owns you anything. For f... sake."
32,tomorrow33,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Basically i'll put it that way, it's no final fantasy VII remake, but it's no fifa either, so take it or leave it lol."
33,rocknr3oll,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Performance is perfectly fine (even tho could use some patches), but still, unlike some companies, they released it day 1 on pc, and it actually runs fairly well if you have up-to-date PC. Some idiots put everything on max and max ray tracing and then complain why it doesn't run 100fps. My god.Game is nothing special btw, but not awful either. It's fine to pass time. Hopefully dlc's make it better. It's not part of absolute hits of 2020, but it's not bottom tier either."
34,smthcool,"Nov  2, 2020",9,It's actually pretty fun game. I mean there have been way worse games in 2020.
35,hauntedheart,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's what you would expect from third watch dogs game. Similar, but little bit different. Not like every gta is 100% different either. London is beautiful, but map could be bigger. More rural areas would help."
36,max-paynedf,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"It's no masterpiece, but it's not that bad either. Deserves way higher score, this game is at least 7."
37,the80ssong,"Nov  2, 2020",10,There's tons of fun to be had with this game. London is beautiful. can't wait for dlc's.
38,friday13th,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's no GTA V that's for sure, but i'm not sure if it was ever intended to be? Like, it's watch dogs game okay. You hack, you use spiderbot, you hack some more. Even tho in this one you can recruit any npc to your army to free London. idk i'm having fun, it's not must buy, but it's better than watch dogs 2."
39,marvel_vs_dc,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Not every video game needs to be miracle okay? It has way more interesting open world than for example Mafia 1 Remake (no hate btw, just saying). This user score makes no sense.But i mean who cares really, it will sell millions of copies no matter what. Ubisoft is popular enough. Just watching people livestreaming this game makes it very clear that most people enjoy it for what it is."
40,thelegendfalls,"Nov  7, 2020",9,"It's absolutely hilarious the read these bitter comments that say ""it gets too many positive reviews, these must be fake"", but when this game got bunch of negative reviews on first two days by absolute losers who don't even own this game, then that was fine right? But now when people who actually own the game and like the game and have been playing it for 4-5 days now come here to leave their reviews and also find out that some bots have absolutely review bombed this, then that's somehow fake? These haters must be some kind of ""special"" people lmao. IGN review of this game got over 17 000 upvotes, Radbrad has been playing it all week and has thousands of views on each video, people are clearly liking this game. To even come up with some kind of ""logic"" that thousands of likes on youtube are real, but for some reason 100-2oo likes on metacritic are fake is just idiotic at best. I pre-ordered this game few months back, been playing it all week, it's nice. London looks very close to real London, my only real issue with it right now is that performance could be better."
41,Cyberdelay2077,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"I bet in 2025 someone makes youtube video about how much they actually liked this game and how innovative it actually was. And then thousands of people will like this video and there will be comments like ""i really liked this game"" or ""am i only one who liked it??"". It's so typical that tons of losers are not able to appreciate games when they come out. LITERALLY same thing happened with Watch Dogs 1, when it was pretty hated in 2014 and now tons of people admit that they absolutely love it. I personally like Watch Dogs 1 more than Legion, but Legion still has some very unique systems to mess around with. I'm mostly excited for Aiden's dlc story."
42,reformthis,"Nov  2, 2020",8,"Recruitment mehanic is true standout in this one. I would still say wait for sale, but it's generally fun."
43,ja6ckx,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"1. Beautiful graphics.2. London is well created.3. tons of unique characters to recruit4. optimization is very good compared to RDR2 optimization on launch.and rockstar had whole year, while this game is day 1 release (and i like rockstar btw, just saying)5. It has no agenda, people who claim that this game has some sort of agenda are literallydelusional. I mean, cyberpunk 2077 will have transgenders, lesbians etc, i bet you gonna love that game lol.6. Ubisoft is amazing and always has been, haters will miss out and who cares honestly, their loss."
44,fLy_,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Worse than first game, better than second game. Overall it's solid watch dogs entry, could have been way worse, like idk, like last of us 2 or something."
45,Gravity67,"Nov  2, 2020",10,1. nice graphics2. darker tone than last game ( i like that )3. stroy is downside
46,lifeline,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"2019 was pretty rough year for ubisoft, but seems like they are back on track again. This year might be even bigger for them than 2018, specially with AC Valhalla coming out very soon.I'm not saying watch dogs legion is something extremely special, but it's million times better ubi game than ghost recon breakpoint. I have played 10 hours so far and it's pretty fun."
47,backintime_,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"It's overall very fun game. Performance of course depends on your PC, but basically if you want these reflections you need RTX GPU. And these RTX reflections truly look nice. It's almost weird going back to older open world games after experiencing it in Legion.Story is whatever, but hacking, free roaming is tons of fun."
48,nobigtrouble,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Reflections are truly amazing, specially at night time. London looks absolutely stunning.There aren't many open world cities that are so beautifully re-created. So far, it's solid."
49,turningthetide,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Basically i'll put it that way, if you liked (or loved) last of us 2 then there's high chance that you are going to hate watch dogs legion, beause watch dogs legion is actually fun."
50,greatestshow,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"lots of 0's on this site just indicate that these people very likely haven't even tried this game. What a shame just to make accounts to lie and try to lower the score, while promoting their own favorite **** game. Literally pathetic. While watch dogs legion is wait for sale, it's not nearly as bad as some people claim. It's no 0, far from it. From gamemaking standpoint it's million times better and more innovative than for example Marvel's Avenger's or even RE 3 Remake."
51,doom3stillbest,"Nov  2, 2020",10,There's very clearly some sort of campaign organized by small group of people to lower user score. This game is not even nearly as bad as come claim it to be. I'm pretty sure most of these who leave 0's don't even own this game.
52,sunriseave,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Anyone saying that this game is technical nightmare or that there are regular crashes is absolutely lying.I have played over 5 hours with zero crashes. Maybe these people don't know how to update drivers or something?? I'm not saying it's technical marvel, but it's runs perfectly well."
53,F_ighter,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Pretty solid game to pass time with or just have fun in the city. What makes this game different from other watch dogs games is ""recruit anyone"" mechanic, basically play as any npc you see on streets. And you can build an army of people basically. But there will be later dlc that focuses on single character story, so basically this game has both aspects."
54,rosesarered,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"It's honestly really cool game. Yeah story is meh, but amount of different people you can recruit is insane. It's so cool. You can dress them up as you want. There's all the usual hacking stuff from previous games. Some negatives too, world design was so much better in first game. This one lacks nature areas. It should be more like gta v with some rural areas, places to explore, not just the city. But overall it's fun. And main character from first game is coming back, that's epic."
55,harm_less,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Nice graphics, gameplay is generally fun, story is meh, better than watch dogs 2."
56,m2ax,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"if you like stealth, hacking and open world city, buy it, if you like mindless action, anime and weird indie games, don't buy it. It's that simple."
57,argent66,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"It's NOT must buy, but, it's still fun enough game to pass time until true 2020 hits come out (AC Valhalla, Black Ops, Miles Morales). Beautiful graphics, fun recruitment system, meh story."
58,thtswhatuget,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Easily in top 10 best games of 2020, it surpasses re3remake, marvel's avengers, last of us part II and new amnesia."
59,Hdteyi,"Nov  6, 2020",10,"It's actually way better  than what i expected. Specially after absolute letdown that WD2 was.Positives would be: combat, npc recruitment system, graphics, drone hacking, hacking in general, spiderbot, underground locations, design of London.Negatives: story is ""eh"", performance could be better.Overall would recommend if you liked watch dogs 1 and are general watch dogs fan."
60,Antio666,"Nov  4, 2020",10,I was able to start play at the lower hardware that was announced. gtx950m i5-7200U and it is really playable. cool.
61,crysis_z,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"driving could use some improvements, map could use more variety (more than just city), but overall it's solid"
62,shallows,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"If you have truble with RTX (low fps) then DLSS helps a lot. Run's fine with RTX 2070, unless you want 4k or some nonsense like that."
63,Thr,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Ubisoft should support PC community now more than ever, because their biggest player base is clearly on PC not consoles. Not to even mention, best version out of all these is clearly PC version, even if it's just for higher fps, but graphically it's also superior version.Graphics options in this game are pretty good honestly, tons of stuff you can tweak. Now about game itself. It's okay i think. I personally liked WD1 story more, but it's whatever.In my opnion, watch dogs strenght was never in story and more about open-world hacking / messing around in the world. Character recruitment adds lots of depth to it."
64,staystrong34,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"i would rate WD games accordingly : WD 1, Legion, WD 2.Legion does some stuff better than other games and some worse. Overall it's decent game, to roam around in and have fun. Maybe it's not amazing right now, but dlc-s are promising. I'm not saying that dlc-s will turn it into masterpiece, but they will add depth to it for sure. Pretty obvious that most negative reviews are from sad empty people who can't enjoy anything in life and need to whine constantly. Get a life seriously."
65,bulletinthewind,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"Graphics are good as usually with Ubisoft games (breakpoint was huge exception). Story could have used way more depth. They simply can't go on with this same model, they need to re-think this stuff. It was fine in 2015, it's not fine anymore. But it seems like Valhalla is already miles better than odyssey or legion. Anyway, strengths of legion doesn't involve story. It's about messing around with hacking mechanics, recruiting interesting characters and just taking what this game has to offer. It's no gta (sadly), but it's just okay. Hopefully dlc's and free updates add some depth and layers to it, otherwise it's kinda wasted potential. Still, even after what i said, it's still more fun than other stuff from 2020 like re3 remake, last of us 2 or marvel's avenger's."
66,Kl3XY,"Nov  1, 2020",8,"Watch Dogs Legion has some very Simple gameplay but was generally able to keep me interested enough too finish the entire game in one sitting (i will not say how long that takes, not sure if that could be a spoiler or not) Although i cannot oversee that in some parts of the game it felt like a downgrade from Watch Dogs 2 (e.g. Clothing Stores just being Tablets you can interact with instead of them being actual stores you can enter). The ""PLAY AS ANYONE"" mechanic works like Ubisoft promised. That you can play as any Citizen and that's out there!, problem is that i heard the same ""Piss easy, i got this"" voice line for so many times my ears went numb, may sound bad but honestly just switch the character if that pisses you off (if you don't want to, too bad). The World, Oho the World, Ubisoft has made a beautiful World set in London. Every corner of the world is wonderfully designed and kept alive because of the different Citizens! (First time reviewing something without a 280 twitter character limit.)"
67,torna_do,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Reading these 0 score reviews is literally hillarious. It's so very clear that these are either double accounts or just losers who never actually play games and possibly just watch livestreams. Watch Dogs Legion is nothing special, but i had way more fun with this, than for example with RE 3 Remake or Marvel's Avengers."
68,drtsd,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Reminds me watch dogs 1 way more than watch dogs 2 and that's a good thing. There could be more areas outside London, but it's fine."
69,Mechanics,"Nov  6, 2020",9,"So far haven't had any performance issues with RTX 2070, but i never max out games anyway, rtx on ultra would be just overkill. Surprisingly haven't encountered almost any bugs, no save game problems ( i guess i'm lucky) and overall it just runs well enough idk what to say lol.After 7 hours, no crashes, but i'm waiting for them because apparently they happen ""all the time"" ...Did i mention this game is fun by the way."
70,ghstrunner,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's watch dogs, you hack, you drive with cars, you fly on drones, there's London, it's epic."
71,canada78,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"positives: hacking, open-world, recruitment system, some cool east eggsnegatives: story is meh"
72,x_radio_x,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's perfectly playable on uptodate pc, there's tons of fun stuff to do. Even just free roaming."
73,eternal367,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Just paused the game to check metascore and i gotta admit that it's fun watch nolifers giving low scores, while actual gamers are enjoying the game and having fun. lol."
74,horisonzero,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"City is really well detailed and graphics looks great, specially at night. Character converstations on streets seemed to be better in Watch Dogs 1, not sure what happened with that. Wait for sale or dlc's."
75,soundsofsilcen,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Basically been playing 5 hours non-stop. What can i say? Perfromance patch is a MUST. It runs perfectly fine 50 to 60 fps, wont even notice drops (no lagg), but solid 60fps should be must. Graphically it's from good to even stunning at times. Some areas look worse, some look better, that's kinda expected from any open world game. Ability to recruit ANY npc makes this game so much more interesting than WD2.World actually feels alive. Also random dialogues that you hear on streets were absolute cringe in WD2, that was one of the reasons i couldn't stand that game. Legion is way better in that aspect, way more serious."

79,so_far_away,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"I'll be honest i have supported Ubisoft since 2014 and i have no intentions to stop. For every MISS, they have another HIT. Thing with Ubisoft is that they make SO many games. Not everything will be masterpiece, but at least they are doing them and a lot. And thank god for that. There's new announcements to come absolutely every summer, every year. They have always ambitious ideas, top tier graphics, solid worlds. Of course they aren't making RDR2 level stuff, it would be impossible in so short time period, but it actually surprises me how close they have got with recent Assassin's Creeds, specially considering that RDR2 is actually pretty empty world, it's still amazing game of course. But still. What i'm trying to say is that Ubisoft is actually very important company for gaming world.Watch Dogs legion is wait for sale/dlc. Unless you wanna mess around with recruiting characters and just have fun. Story sucks."
80,samson23,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"From recent games it's way better than marvel's avengers where you just smash buttons in small empty areas or resident evil 3 remake that was literally 4 hours long AAA game.In watch dogs legion you can recruit any characters in world you see, you can dress them up etc.Some say driving sucks, but you can actually adjust steering and it got way better. You need decent PC to run it tho, but that's like obvious. It's AAA 2020 video games. Of course you need good computer. Just like RDR2 needs good PC."
81,Primark1354,"Nov  2, 2020",8,"A good Ubisoft game. I like the play as anyone aspect. It does have several flaws including the performance (can’t hit 60FPS ultra 4K with DLSS on on my 3090). And the glitches, voice acting sounding dry and mostly not fit the character and the lip syncing is a abysmal. But otherwise I have enjoyed the gameplay and my time with the game overall which is why I give it an 8. If you can get over the performance and character issues like I have there is a good game to be had."
82,shadowrider22,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"This game is VERY CLEARLY not for everyone. STEALTH AND HACKING is main focus in this series. Of course you can fight with guns as well if you want, but it's not hardcore action like gta V. It never was. I personally like it and have high hopes for dlc's to come."
83,pay_back,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Haven't had any crashes so far, not sure what some people are talking about. Maybe it's related to some hardware combinations or older harware? Well anyway, my experience so far (15 hours) has been literally flawless. I'm sure there might have been some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking and i'm not like looking for them either. Story is not very interesting, but overall i would sa it's pretty okay, i wasn't expecting anything from this one anyway, so it kinda surprised me with recruitment mechanic, because that mechanic works very well. Graphics are solid, specially if with RTX turned on. Lemme guess, these 0's are from people who don't have RTX cards? jesus christ."
84,deepwater,"Nov  3, 2020",9,it's pretty decent for what i tries to do. Clearly not for everyone. Best parts are London and character recruitment.
85,lifeguru,"Nov  3, 2020",8,"Some environments are really beautifully created, specially churches and buildings like that.Ray tracing adds tons of depth to it. Story is huge letdown, but i honestly never bought it for the story anyway. I bought it mostly for open world fun and dlc's Aiden's story. Main story never interested me really. Even tho it's really fun that you can recruit literally any npc."
86,nomatter_what,"Nov  6, 2020",10,"I have never visited London, so i have so idea how accurate it is, but youtubers who live in London have said that it is pretty accurate, so that's absolutely very cool that they got this aspect right. RTX in AAA open world game is also huge thing, generally game looks beautiful.It's nothing special, but at the same time ""recruit any npc"" is something very unique in watch dogs series. For conclusion i would say, it's much better than tons of other 2020 games, so yeah. Short answer, nothing special, but can be generally enjoyable game if you don't want something extremely deep."
87,soulseater,"Nov  6, 2020",9,"Never played watch dogs before, just wanted to try something different. Usually been playing dark souls and stuff like that. I gotta say, it's better than i expected. Scanning every npc is really fun and ability to play as any npc is something i have never seen in open world game like this. I guess npc's with more personality is the future or these types of games. GTA VI goes possibly even deeper with this."
88,OntheRadio,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"About 15 hours playtime. Watch Dogs 1 world design was more interesting. London is still pretty cool. Performance is okay. No crashes so far. I really don't care about the story much, but just having fun in the city is pretty enjoyable. Hacking is fun, spider is cool, tons of characters you can recruit. I only wish it had more open areas, everything feels really packed together, i hate that. It's not amazing or groundbreaking, but it's perfectly fine open world game, that could use some improvements. I'm really hoping these improvements come with dlc's and free content that Ubisoft advertised."
89,mandalor,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Pretty solid entry in watch dogs series, i like it way more than second game. Second game was just meh. This one actually has fun stuff to do."
90,firstavenger,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Impressions so far: story could have been so much better, but still open world is actually solid.Graphics are really good if you have PC to run it. Recruitment system works perfectly. Basically what i'm trying to say, there's tons of fun to have. I'm very hopeful for the future of this game.First of they are going add Aiden's DLC, that's epic. Second of, there will be multiplayer in december already. So there seems to be tons of stuff coming. It's not best game of 2020 or something insanely amazing, but it's fun for sure."
91,hopelesstimes37,"Nov  2, 2020",8,"could use some performance patches and dlc's, but it's way better than i thought. Recruitment system is actaully really well done. Way better than watch dogs 2."
92,shadow_x,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"Personal ranking of watch dogs games : 1 , legion , 2.One is still my favorite. It had dark tone, it had very well made map (specially for 2014 game), it had trains you could ride inside, it had lighthouse you could visit, nature areaas.legion doesn't have basically any nature areas (almost), it's mostly city and that's it. It's also darker tone like first game, but with some humor added, but it's fine balance. Sadly it has no trains to ride inside etc. But what it does has is recruit any npc you see on streets system. That's literally best part of legion. Another strenght of legion is graphics, specially with rtx on. watch dogs 2 was too colorful and childish. I don't like games that have zero seriousness.Watch dogs 2 story didn't really hook me either. World was pretty empty."
93,ramon27,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"While Marvel's Avengers was truly disappointing, watch dogs legion is actually surprisingly fun open-world game."
94,g4mer56,"Nov  2, 2020",9,Performance is fine for the most part. Few patches would certainly help. Story sucks for the most part.True fun comes from open world hacking / recruiting character stuff. very hopeful for dlc's to improve the game. also multiplayer is promising.
95,Radio27,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Not perfect. but still pretty solid open-world game. Hacking, recruiting, it's all there just like trailers showed. I prefer watch dogs 1, but legion is fun thing to have fun with."
96,lotrisgreatest,"Nov  3, 2020",9,". So many accounts who gave 0 have 1 review lmao wtf. Well anyway, legion is actually pretty good. If you are not hardcore watch dogs fan, then it's wait for sale."
97,alleksar,"Nov  3, 2020",8,"Love the ""play as anyone concept"".. Game is really fun, and you can spend so much time just driving through london and recruiting new people and completing side missions.. Story seems fine, the only thing which boders me a little is voice acting, but since you can play as anyone i get why they couldn't record 9milion different voices :P"
98,brghtlight,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Better than endless amount copy-paste sports games that come out every year.This one is actual huge open world city, you can hack drones, fly on drones,hack cars and the big one, recruit any npc that walks around in the game world.Compared to Mafia 1 Remake's open world, it's literally night and day difference.Even tho Mafia 1 Remake is clearly more story driven, but still, why have this huge empty open world? Legion actually does something with that open world."
99,Syndicate66,"Nov  5, 2020",9,"Graphics - from 8 to 9.5 (depending if you play on base console or PC).Design of London - 9 / 10 (very immersive city, well done from open world aspect)Sound design - 7.5 (it's okay)Voice acting - from 3 to 8 (literally depends what character you have)Better than WD1? - No.Standout aspects? - Recruit any npc you see on streets of London into your army.Performance - Depends on your hardware, runs well enough with any RTX card, but needs some fps improvement."
100,brokenheart24,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"I'm huge fan of rockstar games but hear me out. Unlike rockstar, ubisoft actually releases their games DAY 1 on pc, not one or two years later. Unlike bethesda they actually fix their bugs and actually try to make their games better. All this hate is just pathetic. I bet it's bunch of losers who praise cdproject because they can pirate their games. lol.Watch Dogs Legion (so far) is fine open-world game. Watch Dogs 1 is my personal favorite, but Legion has it's moments. Coolest part is character recruitment."
101,goodday23,"Oct 31, 2020",9,"Looking at user score, it's pretty clear that CDprojectred fanboys (who pirate their games btw) have just mass down voted watch dogs legion without even trying it. That just shows how bitter these people really are.Anyway, if you liked watch dogs 1, go buy legion, it's worth it. It will have Aiden too later. It wont get craked anyway before 2021, so yea."
102,callitkarma,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Positives - it's very similar to previous games, hacking is still fun, graphics, character recruitment.Negatives. meh story, map isn't very interesting.Overall it's okay. Now everything depends on what bonus content / dlc's they will add.So far i'm optimistic, because this game has tons of unique mechanics that any other game doesn't.It stands out without a question."
103,betterdays23,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"Youtuber Jackspedicy had tons of fun with this game. If he can, anyone can. This game needs tons of improvement to be something deeper than what it is right now, but it has some very unique mechanics, that other games don't. I would still say wait for sale, but it's worth a try. It's not awful."
104,und2errated,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"5 Hours in, it's pretty enjoyable. World could be bigger, but it's okay. In all honesty, Ubisoft deserves all the respect in the world. They are making more games than any gaming company ever. Each year they have huge, top tier graphics, AAA games on table. Yeah some are rushed, some are meh, but there are many good ones. Obviously if you make so many games, not every game can be masterpiece, but at least they are trying. imo it's good to have that, rather than wait 10 years for each GTA. Like come on. I can't wait for next gta, but in meantime i'm absolutely glad that there games like Legion and many more to pass time."
105,diadiakoctia,"Nov  7, 2020",8,"Впервые прошел игру серии Watch Dogs, хоть и другие у меня есть в библиотеке. Тут отличный Лондон, злободневный сюжет и свежий подход с ""главными героями"".

106,tvis_dead,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"If you didn't like watch dogs 1, you wont like legion, if you liked watch dogs 1 you might like legion. Legion will also have first game's main character, so there's that connection too."

109,selfishhero,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Impressions so far, it's way better than second watch dogs. In last game you had one boring protagonist, here you can recruit any npc you want. This one has at least interesting dlc's. They are literally bringing back first game's main character. Thank god."
110,cyberdelay,"Nov  3, 2020",9,"Cyberpunk 2077 will never come out anyway, so you might as well buy this game and at least have some kind of fun.

It's so typical that every new games gets downvoted into oblivion, but if there happens to be positive reviews, then it's fake lmao. No to mention literally 90% of these 0's reviews have only one review and very clearly fake. Just watching some youtube livestreams with thousands of likes (for watch dogs legion) it's VERY clear that most people are at least enjoy this game. Nobody is saying it's perfect or masterpeice, but it's no 0, that's for sure.So far i'm having fun, first game was better, but this is still solid effort and way better than WD2.can't wait for dlc's."

121,Thereallife,"Nov  6, 2020",10,"Fact that it has so much lower user score literally blows my mind. It must have been hardcore review bombing by people who never even cared if this game comes out. Been playing for two days now and it's pure joy to finally play something i actually care about. I barely finished second game, it was just so boring. Open world was boring, characters were boring, story was weak. Legion's story is also weak (i guess it's a trend with these games), but there's so much more that keeps my interest. Hopefully wont get cracked in months, it would be disgusting if these same people who give 0's would download it for free. I bet they would do same with cyberpunk 2077. I will keep supporting this game and i'm also going to buy season pass, because they bring Aiden back. And i will also support cyberpunk 2077 and actually buy it."

124,daydreamer99,"Nov  7, 2020",10,"It's fine enough watch_dogs game. I would only recommend it, if you actually really liked first game, because in dlc first game's main character come back as playable character. Until that happens, there's enough fun to be had with npc recruitment.Only reason people give this game 10's is because this game was reviewbombed in first three days (look at dates) with zeros by people who don't even care about watch dogs.

Story is nothing special, but whole open-world makes up for it. Also, Aiden dlc is very promising. If you don't like stealth/hacking then this game is not for you. It doesn't have planes like gta, but it has drones you can fly on. Overall i think it was never meant to be gta clone, it tries to do some stuff differently and that's how it should be. I really liked watch dogs 1, so if you liked watch dogs 1, you might like this too."

129,shadowoftheday,"Nov  3, 2020",9,I guess console versions suck or something? or why they have so low scores?PC version run's perfectly fine 60-80fps with any rtx card. Of course there's literally no needto max out everything (specially rtx ultra is just big no).

NPC recruitment add way more depth to this game.I'm not sure if these people who add 0's and pretend that it's worst game ever, actually watched any trailer before buying it? They literally delivered what they promised.I would like to bet that most of these who gave 0's don't even own the game, reading their ""reviews"" that usually containt ""ubisoft sucks"" make it even more obvious."

135,understandlife,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Someone who pointed out that watch dogs is childish game, that absolute BS.Maybe second game was more childish, but both first game and legion are very much mature games for adults. First game had tons of female nudity and in Legion you can almost completely undress any character. It's very much adults game. Just cause it doesn't have your pseudo-intellectual dialog system or because it isn't book/dialogue simulator, doesn't mean it's not mature.I bet people like that also hate GTA V,  RDR2, Alan Wake and so on. Basically they don't actually like or want games, they want games to be books. And while i agree that it's nice to have deep story, there's difference between fun video game and dialogue simulator."

142,Juniorsp,"Nov  4, 2020",8,"WDL é uma evolução agradável da serie, a sensação que eu tive é que a Ubisoft tentou deixar o game mais limpo e com menos excesso de coletáveis o que na minha opinião e muito bem vindo. Joguei com Ray Tracing ligado com uma placa RTX e a sensação prazerosa de nova geração é inevitável. Tendo jogado os dois jogos anteriores posso dizer que Legion é um excelente game, ficando em segundo lugar na minha lista que ainda tem o primeiro titulo no topo. Infelizmente o game tem seus problemas técnicos e de desempenho mas nada que estrague as horas de diversão que ele pode proporcionar. Em resumo uma grata surpresa neste final de ano"
143,forgotten37,"Nov  2, 2020",10,"It's pretty decent game, no masterpeice, far from it.

So basically graphics are great as expected, recruiting npc's is actually very unique feature. London looks nice.Basically it's not must buy by any means, unless you just wanna have fun.

150,kissthesky,"Nov  5, 2020",9,"This is day 1 release on all platforms and it works (for the most part) well enough. Specially compared to some other releases from recent years like RDR2 from Rockstar. They wait 1 year with PC release and on launch...well it didn't launch and after many patches when it finally launched it was buggy with awful performance. It took them 3 months to RDR2 to somewhat okay performance level. I'm saying all this as huge rockstar fan by the way, but that launch was absurdly disappointing. WD Legion actually runs well enough, even tho it clearly needs performance boost, but at least it can actually keep 60fps even with rtx on and i haven't personally had basically any bugs or crashes. There many other comparisons i could make like Fallout 76 launch (even tho they never even tried to fix this game) and Just Cause 4 launch was just awful. So compared to all these, Watch Dogs Legion is pretty solid and i'm having fun so far."

Unlike positive reviews that absolutely make sense, because game is solid, most of these zeros are from accounts with 1 review and these came in day 1 and day 2. These are absolutely without any question fake accounts trying to lower the user score.

In gta 5 it has never annoyed me, but in watch dogs 2 it was just way too much. Anyway when they announced watch dogs legion i didn't care much, because i had lost interest in this series years ago. Then i heard that they bring back Aiden Pearce, that got me little bit more interested. So long story short, i bought it. This new npc thing is pretty interesting idea.

Just cause it has some character that say some stuff you don't like, doesn't mean it has sjw agenda.

It's not GTA 5 anymore, that game was 7 years ago. And don't get me wrong, i absolutely deeply love GTA 5, it's one of my all time favorite games. But giving npc's deeper personality is literally how open world games are going to evolve from now on and that's normal. GTA 6 will very likely do exactly same, give character's different personalities etc. If they don't it will be huge step back. But they already kinda tried it in RDR 2, so it's pretty obvious what GTA 6 will look like. It has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with some sjw stuff that some people claim, all it has to do with is making open worlds more interesting, that's all there is. If anything watch dogs 2 was sjw game and i wasn't fan of that game. Every npc on street was literally the same. Legion reminds me more Watch Dogs 1 that had darker tone than Watch Dogs 2. While WD1 is still best WD game imo, Legion is close second place and different npc's / npc recruitment makes it stand out.

200,Calanq,"Oct 31, 2020",8,"Watch Dogs: Legion is a great addition to the series and thus far I have been enjoying it thoroughly. Downsides: The biggest downsides to Legion are game design choices that don't seem to make much sense (at least to me). For example, London in the game is just a few boroughs that colloquially constitute the city - the most central part that ends with Camden Town up North. Also, everyone in game speaks like a geezer while in reality London has a very wide gamut of accents. It is considerably, remarkably less homogenous. Moreover, the city itself isn't very vibrant in game. It's neon and colourful, but the different areas feel the same, unlike with the real thing. On the flipside, many areas are recognizable and I think the key elements of them are there. It just doesn't feel like London overall - that sense has not been captured. Not in the same way that San Francisco felt like San Francisco in Watch Dogs 2. There are many more unrealistic things in the game, but it's a video game - it's meant to be fun (even if Neil Druckmann might argue). So I only draw my attention to the parts where Legion yields to real London significantly in terms of that sense of exploration. Some good things about the game:1. I think mechanically it is about as fun as Watch Dogs 2.2. the mechanic where a lot of the story characters are randomly generated is a breath of fresh air, and I like it.3. the game supports Nvidia DLSS and it is one of the titles where with Nvidia 20 series cards you can actually run ray-tracing with decent framerates, also the game is well-optimized and the framerate doesn't dip as much as in many other Ubisoft titles.4. Graphically the game is pleasing.5. The story is a little convoluted but about to the same degree as in Watch Dogs 2 - it's quite enjoyable.6. The hacks no longer deplete charges, instead each individual hack recharges, and quite fast. It's a welcome change.7. Surprisingly, all the dynamic characters have quite unique voices. What I would improve:1. there is a bug with setting the contrast in video settings, the setting is far too sensitive and the preview images do not reflect the actual strength by far.2. there are some loose subtitles coming from nowhere.3. when driving under street lights at night, sometimes the sky changes brightness drastically due to eye adaptation.From my experience in game production, those are not high priority issues. So the game is quite polished for launch, especially by Ubisoft standards. Performance:I have two computers I've tried it on. Legion gets 35-40 fps average on a 7th generation i7 & Nvidia 1080 on low settings at 1080p. 80 fps average on a Ryzen 3900x and Nvidia 2070 S on nearly Ultra settings (except Ray Tracing, or with Ray Tracing but DLSS) at 2K. It crashes every few hours on the Ryzen but not on the i7. So far the crashes have all happened within minutes of the Boring-Sundae error, which I experienced only on the Ryzen. Otherwise the performance is quite good and severely aided by DLSS. If your card supports DLSS, you will have a great time. Multiplayer:Multiplayer isn't available at launch. At this time, it is planned to launch in December. Overall gameplay:The main gameplay loops are tight, you will generally always be engaged in a few tasks that feel rewarding. Locations are reused between missions so they can get a little bit old. But I've already spoke about the map feeling relatively small for a Ubisoft game. To close, I think it's important that we recognize that this game has faults as well as great technical achievements. Let's not review-bomb it because it didn't meet crazy-high expectations at launch. For anyone interested in playing it - it's playable, it's fun, and it's worth the £12-24 (depending on how long it will take you to get enough of it) on Ubisoft+, hands-down."
201,comawhite23,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"Watch Dogs Legion is average at best, but still miles better than last of us part 2, so that makes it basically automatic win-win for ubisoft.

There's clearly more to this.

211,ohwell,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"HONEST REVIEW AFTER 5 HOURS OF PLAYINGThis game is playable and even fun, but there are many problems (not technical). How they managed to make city more boring than in first game is just mindlbowing. I just can't understand. This (only small streets and buildings) approach is outdated and doesn't work anymore. It's okay, but this is really, really last time they can do it like that. Next game needs to be different. They need to really re-think their approach about map design. You can't just have endless streets and buildings on your WHOLE MAP. This is the place where they really should learn from GTA 5, you can't make open world game like this anymore. Rockstar did it in 2008 with GTA 4 and even then they had tons of buildings to go inside. Ironically Ubisoft did it better in 2014 with Watch Dogs 1. Watch Dogs 1 map design was so much better, you had more nature etc. Storys is ""whatever"", honestly kinda boring. I'm still hopeful that they can do something cool with Aiden dlc. But yea, you can't have ""just city"" in 2020 anymore, you need to have outside areas, nature, mountains, all that jazz. For the love of god i hope Assassin's Creed Valhalla will be good."
212,maxrtx,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"I only bought it because i'm hardcore fan, but i would say wait for sale/until dlc-s are out. It's clearly not for everyone. Still it doesn't deserve that low user score. I would say Assassin's Creed Valhalla or Black Ops would be better games to buy."
213,shinealight,"Nov  5, 2020",9,"PC version needs some serious patches that makes fps better. Consoles versions will obviously run better on Xbox Series X or PS5, but PS4 Pro runs it fine as well. Overall very unique concept, recruit any npc, make army of them, free London. London looks beautiful btw."
214,lifedeath,"Nov  1, 2020",8,"GTA 4 had better map design. Watch Dogs 1 had better map design. What i'm trying to say is that watch dogs legion's map design sucks. No nature areas. BUT. It's not awful game, these 0 scores make absolutely no sense on this site. I'm very confident these people don't have that game. I would say wait until Aiden dlc comes out and then decide if you wanna buy it. I would say from November games AC Valhalla or Black Ops would be better options. But i still need to repeate, it's not BAD game. It's just mediocre."
215,Kaz_S,"Nov  3, 2020",10,Fantastic Game. Very well realised London and very ambitious in scope. Not perfect due to some bugs but is one of the most next gen games coming out

It's very clear that bunch of people who don't even own the game have just downvoted it. This user score has very clearly been manipulated. Not that it changes the game for worse or better. It's still fun game to play if you like previous watch dogs games. I never really cared for watch dogs 2, but watch dogs 1 was cool."
218,firefly37,"Nov  6, 2020",9,"I'm very happy that Ubisoft is finally back and actually delivered solid game. 2019 was just awful for Ubisoft. They are one of my favorite game studios alongside Rockstar and Capcom. Specially for Assassin's Creed series, but watch dogs is fun too. I personally prefer Watch Dogs 1, but this one is also solid, specially for npc recruitment mechanic, that's completely new addition for watch dogs series."
219,jack67s,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"Is it must buy? NO, is it one of the worst game of 2020? NO, in fact, far from it. What you saw in trailer is exactly what you're going to get. At least they didn't lie to their fans like Naughty Dog did with last of us 2. And to make it clear, watch dogs legion is about million times more enjoyable than last of us 2."
220,lnknpark,"Oct 31, 2020",8,"Well i rather play this than Demon Souls remake or miles morales dlc. This one is actual open-world game. miles morales is just reskin of original original spiderman with some snow and some new effects. It very clear that people who have to wait 40 days for cyberdelay 2077 are bitter af right now and are trying to let their anger out giving watch dogs legion 0-s. I mean good luck, because no matter how many bad reviews you leave, fact is, that watch dogs legion is decent game that tons of people enjoy. truth hurts, right? lol"

I'm actually really enjoying it."
224,ren7der,"Nov  4, 2020",9,"So much better than second game, i literally gave up on second game halfway thru. Not only was story childish, whole open world was just cringe. All the npc's on streets said literally same things, there was absolutely no variety. Everything was just meh. Legion improves on basically all these aspects. Npc's are actually different now, stand out. You can actually recrurit any character to play with and are not restricted to one boring protagonist. Graphics are also nice with rtx on. I'm not saying it's something special, but it's right step forward for sure."
225,combative788,"Oct 31, 2020",10,"Positives: Top tier 2020 Graphics, you can play as (almost) any character in the game, more serious tone than previous game (reminds watch dogs 1), Aiden will be back as dlc character. Negatives: penguinz0 think only he knows what fun game means and if he doesn't find something fun, nobody should. I bet Assassin's Creed Valhalla gets even more bitter review from him lmao.Also something to point out, this game is getting review bombed by people who don't even own the game."

228,theassistant,"Nov  5, 2020",9,"First time ever actual London in all it's HD glory is in video games. GTA London could have been any city, but this one actually feels like London. There's some stuff i like, there's some stuff i don't like. Positives first, rtx graphics are amazing, npc recruitment is fun enough, many secret areas underground to explore, flying on drones can be fun, hacking is great as usual.Negatives, performance isn't best, patches are necessary, story missions could have used more variety, not just endless downloading, even tho there is some shooting as well, driving could be better, but there's ways to make it better in setting menu.Overall: not must buy, but fun enough if you like watch dogs series, hopefully dlc's and multiplayer improve it."
229,lightindarkness,"Oct 31, 2020",10,"Very enjoyable open-world game. Most negative reviews are either losers who watch penguinz0 (because this dude hates ubisoft no matter what) or cyberpunk fanboys who are bitter that it got delayed into 2030. If you liked Watch Dogs 1, you gonna like this even more. Can't wait for Aiden dlc."
230,ubiprojectred,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Cyberpunk will be delayed until 2033 anyway, so who cares really. I would say watch dogs legion is 10/10 and huge win for gamers all over the world."

232,justfine,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"idk it's weird. I feel they really messed up with creating this map. London is nice, sure, but open-world games need more in 2020. Ironically they absolutely get it with Assassin's Creed, so why they messed made Watch Dogs map so small makes no sense. All in all, it's actually fun game to play. Better than many others that released in 2020. Hopefully watch dogs 4 has bigger map."
233,november22,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Umm it's okay i guess. I certainly don't hate it and i plan to play more, but i'm mostly waiting for dlc. It's morel iike wait for sale, but it's still fine game."
234,dawnoffall,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"performance is fine, but they will clearly patch it more. story is meh, hacking is fun, recruiting characters is fine, open world is fine, even tho could be bigger. Graphics are solid. By no means best watch dogs game, but it's not bad game."
235,john237,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Nothing special, nothing bad. Not every game needs to be revolutionary, even tho, in some aspects it actually is. You can recruit any character and that's epic. 4.7 user score is absurdly low. I wish more fans would visit this site, but it only seems to attract haters. But then again, it's very clear that these scores doesn't matter. So yea, whatever. Can't wait for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, that game will be amazing."
236,ulostlol,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Haven't had basically any bugs personally. There's tons of fun to be had, but it's mostly related to recruiting characters and just messing around in the city and not that much for the story."
237,likeafire,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Basically if your game is not absolute perfection, it shouldn't even exist. Or at least that the message this user score sends right now. Pathetic. Anyway, it's average open-world hacking game, story is repetitive, so most fun comes from recruiting characters and messing around in the game world. It's by no means bad game."
238,FoxHound88,"Nov  4, 2020",9,"Rating: 9/10 Pros:1. The recruitment system is really unique, and I loved it. Creating your own team, and having to use each team member for certain missions was a great addition. Even team members that you don't use have useful passive abilities that make the game fun. It's probably my favorite feature of the game. You don't have to recruit people to beat the game. You can actually beat it with one agent, but the real fun is finding the advantages and disadvantage of each member of your teams skill set, and trying to beat the mission the way you want to beat it. All the missions have different ways of completing them. It really gave me a feeling I was playing the Hitman franchise with tons of freedom. 2. The world building is great. The city of London feels alive, and watching the NPC's interact with each other really makes the city feel real. 3. Graphics are really good. Especially at nighttime on my 2080ti and RTX turned on. It's really impressive. Probably the first game with RTX that impressed me. I love the sci-fi feeling to the city. It's a great placeholder until Cyberpunk finally comes out. 4. Story is actually interesting, and I did enjoy it. Cons:1. Even though I did enjoy the missions, I did wish they added more variety to the task being performed. I get the game is about hackers, but I did want a little more diversity, but even with this con the missions were still fun, and the progression of unlocking new team members kept me hooked. I'm not a big fan of the Watch Dogs 1 and 2. I always thought the concept was cool, but the execution was meh. Could not keep my attention for more than 3-5 hours. Legion is really impressive, and a great direction for the franchise. I don't want to write a long review because I'm not a journalist, but here is my pro's and Cons."
239,Davel33123,"Oct 31, 2020",10,The city and its citizens are far more detailed in Legion compared to previous Watch dog games.I'm about 13 hours in and I couldn't be happier with whats been made here .Its mostly pure infiltration stealthy missions which i am absolutely fine with ! Patch has fixed 90% of niggles ... buy it
240,cdprjetredsucks,"Nov  1, 2020",9,"Personally haven't had any bugs, cliches or crashes, maybe i have been lucky idk. Everything works perfectly fine with ryzen cpu. Game isn't anything special, in fact, i like watch dogs 1 more than this. BUT STILL, what's with extremely low user score?  They delivered exactly what they promised in trailers, unlike Naughty Dog. I'm not sure what miracle some gamers were hoping, because it's exactly what they promised. You build an army with people, free London, good graphics, ray tracing. That's THE GAME they advertised. Why some people act like they were lied to or something? I'm pretty confident it's just bunch of cyberpunk fanboylosers who hate everything they can't pirate. Pathetic, but that's the reality of gaming in 2020, so yea, whatever."
241,lifegoeson,"Nov  4, 2020",9,"There's absolutely no SJW stuff. There's tons of different npc's (people) JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE. It's not your dreamy safe haven like gta 5 where everyone is hot blonde. Not that Watch Dogs Legion doesn't have hot blondes, of course it does. Like i said, it has everything. Not just your pick and choose characters. They actually tried to make the world feel real and it actually worked. I guess people who complain that the game happens to have ""certain characters"" they don't like, don't go outside either? I mean, keep hiding in your safehouse, good luck...Watch Dogs Legion developers actually tried to give npc's personality, so they wouldn't be just copy-paste blank faces. London actually feels like real city now. I guess these people will uninstall Cyberpunk 2077 as well, because this game will have all these things as well (and possibly even more). So yeah, whatever. Real world is too scary for some people i guess."
242,greenbay28,"Nov  4, 2020",10,"Good enough game to have some fun with, until true 2020 hits (Assassin's Creed Valhalla / Black Ops / MIles Morales) comes out. Haven't had any major bugs or crashes personally. Perfromance pathces are needed tho."

247,jackstarr001,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Approached as an Immersive Sim, Watch Dogs: Legion works incredibly well, and is a great deal of fun to play. Use the gameplay systems and intelligent level design to your advantage...you can play pretty much the entire game as a shooter, or using stealth - but the game really shines when you leverage the recruit system and mix up your gameplay. You can use all gadgets with all recruits, and while it's nice that you have the freedom to do so should you wish, I'd suggest bringing to the table some roleplay - only use certain gadgets with recruits that make the most sense...roleplay each character according to their own backstory, moral outlook and initial skillset, and the game becomes even more interesting."
248,Tfn,"Nov  1, 2020",10,"Ubisoft has created a master piece.I haven't found any bugs so far.The gameplay is fantastic.The graphics are incredible, despite the mischievous reviews, the game is very optimized.

257,Jonasb159,"Oct 30, 2020",9,"Really fun game, a lot to do in it and a good story. I know it won't give satisfaction to everyone, but it sure does the job for me. I think I didn't play a game which I liked more than this one. Great graphics also. And thank you to add the accessibility settings, it makes it a lot better for me as I have a physical disability. Thanks to this settings I can play it with permadeath on and at normal difficulty level. Usual I need to play games at easy.  I also can play it for a long time without any sign of boredom or irritation and each character you recruit is different enough. With permadeath on you care also about who you recruit, so you are more careful. I try not to rush if on missions I'm using my favorite characters, so they will see another day. And I use them a lot! :D"
258,Metallic37,"Nov  4, 2020",9,"Pretty solid game for what it tries to do. Nothing outstanding, but giving npc's deeper personality is future of open world games for sure.

259,LadyAux,"Nov  6, 2020",8,"Had little to no hope for Legion and what Ubisoft has been releasing Lately. Even only playing the first Watch Dogs, I can say that I was wildly surprised by how much I actually am enjoying Legion. It just has this better feel and tone set in London and the whole idea of playing as multiple operatives seems to have done away with most of the repetitive gameplay. Legion feels a lot more like you are playing a Splinter Cell game, sneaking around, hacking drones and garroting people from behind. Even on my sub par PC, Legion looks stunning and can keep up with all the stuff going on in the world. Just ignore most of the usual Ubi junkiness with all the bugs and potato looking NPC's and you get a fairly decent game, probably the best in the series so far. It's by no means the shining star in Ubisoft's catalogue of titles but it has kept me invested and engaged so far for my playthrough. Watch my full review here for more: https://youtu.be/vQJXW8yRXH8"

268,amazingusername,"Nov  7, 2020",10,"If someone actually thinks Ubisoft cares about metacritic userscore, just get help or something. They are one of the most popular gaming studios and will sell millions of copies no matter what this useless userscore is (usually by 500 to 1000 reviews and most of these are just spam). This score has absolutely zero accountability. People give 10's to this BECAUSE this game was review bombed by fake accounts on release day. So clearly people need to give 10's to get this score to where it actually needs to be, because this game is about 7.5 to 8, not 5, not even 6. Instead of looking positive scores (that are normal for solid game like this) you should look at negative reviews, that have usually 1-2 reviews and it's for this game. This is only reason i made this account, to write this, because this message needs to be out there. Here's literally one user literally exposing itself and telling flat out that he doesn't have this game and he just gives this game zero, because he is p.ce of sht. If that's not proof that these zero's are fake, idk what else is. I bet he made 50 of these accounts. Ubisoft is amazing, haters can just f off. Thank you very much."

270,Exiled_Patriot,"Oct 30, 2020",8,"There really isn’t any outright SJW messaging and SJWs are complying there isn’t enough so don’t believe that nonsense. It’s your standard Ubisoft Open World where Baddie A taken over an area and there’s a conspiracy with Baddie B, and You must organize an underdog resistance against them. London itself is done quite beautifully though the character models leave much to be desired. Think mannequins in a masterpiece of art, and keep that thought it will be important later. The gameplay is actually fun and very open ended. It’s offers aloooot of replayability and choice in missions, making the mission zones more puzzles to be figured out over running and gunning, though that can be done as well. The recruit anyone feature is really interesting because you can even recruit police to your cause. The only real downside to the game is the story is because since there’s no real MAIN character the games story seems really disjointed at times remember these are all mannequins in different outfits and abilities. But like I said above, the gameplay is great and makes up for the stories shortcomings. . Is it game of the year? Far from it but it’s a good entry to the series as a whole and I’d love to see the “play as anyone” feature expanded on as long as there was some character or element tying everything and grounding it all together properly."

277,Brunolauri,"Oct 30, 2020",9,"Watch Dogs: Legion delivers on its' main promise. All the NPC's on the streets are playable and varied in their own ways. Some may be faster at hacking (downloading data) while having their own cons such as slower speed or inferior mobility. The gameplay is smooth and well realized for the most part. You can smoothly and easily switch between sources of video in the game, everything from you to cameras to your drone. The story is intriguing enough to keep you playing but as you'd expect, the lack of a protagonist makes it a little disjointed at times. The voice acting is what you'd expect from procedurally generated AI, but honestly not as bad as some make it seem. The world is truly great, it is one of the most detailed worlds I've ever played in and it is quite interesting as well. Same goes for the graphics as well for the game. You might see people complaining on the performance of the game. While it is true that at times the frames drop quite a lot you also have to consider your graphics settings. Running this game on a RTX 2070 Super gets you about 50+ fps on 1080p very high settings with raytracing enabled and considering how it looks, the game is actually quite well optimized in the end of the day. This is a good fun game that will get you plenty of enjoyment in the long run and as such I'll give the game a score of 8.7/10, rounding it off to 9/10."

279,Nysp,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"As it has become a tradition, Watch Dogs is attacked on social networks at its launch. But the game is very good and unfair by haters, despite the problems. Unlike the games in the series, this one takes place in the near future. This creates some new perspectives in gameplay. Technologies that today still seem distant from our reality, are already quite common in the open world of the game. I didn't like the series going into that future. I would still prefer it to be set on current days. But the game has not become a futuristic sci-fi, it leads well despite the new technologies present. About the gameplay, some commands have been changed compared to WD2. But it is very similar and fun as always, especially hacking. London's graphics are beautiful but the NPCs (which are controllable) are well below quality. The story is cliché in the extreme. Since there is no protagonist, we have little empathy with the controllable characters. They are more fun to play than they are deep in history. The problems aren't as big as the game's (and Ubisoft's) haters make it look on social media, but they do exist. However, this does not detract from the fun of the game at all. Like the other two titles in the series, it is a very good game but does not take advantage of all the opportunities it has to establish itself as a major franchise. In my preference, it is behind the first 2, but maintained a good level to wait for a really great sequence of the series. Hopefully it has a lot of DLC. PS: i wrote the same review on PS4 version because I have both (PC and PS4 version).-------------------------------In Brazilian Portuguse: Como já virou tradição, Watch Dogs é atacado nas redes sociais em seu lançamento. Mas o jogo é muito bom e injustiçado, apesar dos problemas. Diferentemente dos jogos da série, esse se passa num futuro próximo. Isso cria algumas novas perspectivas na gameplay. Tecnologias que hoje ainda parecem distante da nossa realidade, já são bem comuns no mundo aberto do jogo. Particularmente, não gostei da série ter ido para esse futuro. Ainda preferiria que fosse nos dias atuais. Mas o jogo não se tornou um sci-fi futurista, está bem pé no chão apesar das novas tecnologias presentes. Em questão de jogabilidade, alguns comandos foram trocados em relação ao WD2. Mas está muito parecido e divertido como sempre, especialmente hackear. Os gráficos de Londres estão lindos mas os NPC (que são controláveis) estão bem abaixo na qualidade. A história é clichê ao extremo. Como não há protagonista, temos pouca empatia com os personagens controláveis. Eles são mais divertidos de se jogar do que profundos na história. Os problemas não são tão grandes como os haters do jogo (e da Ubisoft) fazem parecer nas redes sociais, mas eles existem. Porém, isso não tira a diversão do jogo de forma alguma. Assim como os outros dois títulos da série, é um jogo muito bom mas não aproveita todas as oportunidades que tem pra se firmar como grande franquia. Na minha preferência, fica atrás dos 2 primeiros, mas manteve um bom nível para esperar por uma sequência realmente grande da série. Tomara que tenha muitas DLC."

290,Indovers,"Oct 30, 2020",0,Worst perfomance 2020.Low FPS on gtx 1080ti (even on 1080p + medium settings).Game crashes every 20-40 minutes.
291,anihavoc,"Oct 30, 2020",3,"Below Average at Best. Gameplay Loop: Probably the most enjoyable aspect of Legion with a multitude of ways to approach certain missions and gives you a decent variety. ( Most Definitely not all... a good amount are just limited to picking between Stealth / Guns Blazing ) World Building: A decent amount of building up the background of the world in Legion is decently done, with a standard attention to world design and art to make it somewhat believable. Story: Absolute Rubbish, If you play it, play it for the Gameplay because if you're looking for a okay, decent or good story.. it's definitely not in this game Protagonist / Character development - Non existent and not believable in any shape of form. At some point in the game you can recruit anyone in the world for your ""Dedsec"" cause which makes no sense what so ever. ""Play as anyone"" sounds great on paper but it greatly sacrifices character development and meaningful story. Visuals: With RTX and HDR, it's a pretty damn good looking game outside of very dated character models in some ways. The Graffiti Art and Murals found around the city of london are nicely done, but it's a very flat experience with no depth to the world design. There are definitely areas and buildings that stand out that are highly enjoyable to go down or look at. Texture Quality is acceptable with 4K Texture Pack installed. Some animations are high quality while others remain somewhat janky and seem disconnected. Performance: Running it at 4K RTX on a heavily OC'd 3090FE / 9700K @ 5.0ghz I was clocking 66 fps Average on the Benchmark with Ultra except shadows on high, and DLSS Quality / RTX Medium.The performance is really all over the place, Walking around in the outside parts of the city I'd average between 55-70fps depending on the density and weather. Using a Vehicle I would see framerates as low as 39. It's a poorly optimized title. Voice Acting: Mediocre at best, the voice AI doesn't match a lot of dialogue which looks very janky. A lot of clingy dialogue in the game that tries to appeal to youth today but misses the mark greatly and feels just straight up out of touch. Facial Animations: Really Janky, looks as if some characters are given puppet mouths for their dialogue. Definitely some of the worst I've seen in awhile. Audio: Running on a ZMF Verite / ZMF Pendant Tube Amp/ Denafrips PONTUS DAC and analyzing the quality of audio seperation ques, dynamic range, music and soundscapes of London - the over all quality is somewhat average and shouldn't expect anything spectacular.-Only your vehicle transmits radio music into the game world when exiting- Radio music selection is subjectively alright but mediocre in over all quality, sounds like they ripped straight up 128kbps files and threw them in as radio stations- Dynamic Range isn't that great as far as being accurate, voices are far too loud, vehicles sound way too soft with barely any texture, Guns lack ""oomph"" and use standard sound effects, Crashing into vehicles is the same generic sound file over and over again, NPC voice lines, while sometime hilarious, there's quite a small amount of lines and are heavily repeated through out my experience.-Imaging is fairly decent, it's easy to pick apart the placement of audio ques in the game world.-Fairly low amount of actual ambient sounds in the game, which is a bit immersion breaking-Voice Over quality is quite subpar from the norm thanks to the weird, digital sounding pitch shifts they used for voices. World Depth - It's very flat, don't expect a super dense interesting world, it's very ""open world gamey"" feeling in its presentation, although it does a decent job at pervading the world building aspect of the current political climate its set in NPC AI - Far below average for the most part, It will quickly be noticed that you can get away with quite a lot even though its suppose to be set in a very dystopian setting. It's a very immersion breaking aspect of the game and doesn't make it believable regardless of its setting. Aesthetics: Good in some ways, such as the strong Punk Rock / Metal culture vibes in some of the areas but quite cringy and out of touch in others. It honestly feels like they purposely ripped off a small chunk of what CDPR is looking to accomplish with Cyberpunk 2077 but in a tasteless, soulless way. Microtransactions: Despicable Predatory MTX model that shouldn't be included in single player titles that they most likely are looking to implement even more heavy into the multiplayer component once its released. There are progress boosters and Cosmetics."
292,Nirvana777,"Nov  8, 2020",10,"AAA Gaming landscape overall would be pretty empty without Ubisoft. That's just fact.They release huge and even smaller games every single year. Not everything hits the nail, but it would be miracle if everything did. 2019 was generally huge mistake for them and i'm pretty confident it wont happen again. They simply can't afford it. Even tho they have millions of fans around the world, there seems to be this small group of angry/hateful people who try to damage their games by giving zero scores without even buying the game and not only their games, other companies as well (these people don't actually really care about gaming, they just have nothing better to with their lives, it's very obvious). And this mass downvoting on watch dogs legion literally day 1 is perfect example of that. Assassin's Creed has way larger fanbase (literally millions) than watch dogs, so hopefully Assassin's Creed fans are ready to protect Valhalla when it releases, because this kind of mass downvoting can't happen again. Now about the game, been playing around 20 hours i think. So far it's pretty fine watch dogs entry, i wasn't expecting anything crazy anyway from this, but it's solid 7.5, maybe even 8 for how good London looks."

303,leadtheway,"Nov  8, 2020",9,"I support this because i really like this idea of open world hacking game. It just needs to be done right. There's two way it can go, they either improve this one with 1. MULTIPLAYER, 2. AIDEN PEARCE DLC STORY, 3. IMPROVE OVERALL GAME MECHANICS LIKE DRIVING. Either these or they just need to go all out with watch_dogs 4. They got London right, that's good. What they didn't is that this game feel way packed together, EVERY OPEN WORLD GAME NEEDS AREAS TO TAKE TIME DOWN, BREATHE. It has some on if and i'm glad it does, but i would like these kinds of games have some kind of forest area, nature area, just like watch_dogs 1 did. ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE CITY, ANYTHING, PLEASE. I absolutely don't care if real London don't have nature areas, PRETEND IT DOES, IT'S A VIDEO GAME. You can do whatever you want with it. Still i'm not giving up on it just yet, i really wanna see what they do with season pass and if Aiden's story is good enough. If they this right, this might actually be pretty decent hacking/open world game that takes place in London and that's actually (at least to me) very important aspect. I like London. I love it's architecture (yeah i'm history nerd, sue me). NPC recruitment is very unique idea BUT IT NEEDS MORE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IT NEEDS MORE. Like i said, i'm still hopeful, would love to fly on cargo drones with Aiden Pearce and play his missions. Could be actually cool. Even tho i kinda trashed it, don't get me wrong, i still like this game. It's miles better than completely empty open world of mafia remake, i don't care if it focuses on story, if you have huge open world, do something with it. Watch_Dogs is at least doing something. And it's overall by any means more fun than Marvel's Avengers, these are not even comparable. I'm not saying these things AT ALL to trash other games, i'm just pointing out facts. My recommendation would be either wait for sale, wait for season pass or just take whatever this game has to offer right now. It's overall very promising and at times very fun."

This one is decent with potential to get better.Also side note: People who live 1's or 0's can't even write with decent grammar lol.Ubisoft games are usually from decent to even very good. Good example is Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, this game is amazing. So whoever says that Ubisoft games suck, has absolutely no taste in gaming whatsoever.

The good is that you never run out of side quests to do in order to recruit more people, but the bad is it can get repetitive after doing it for the 50th time. This game took a huge risk with this mechanic, did it pay off, you tell me. It is still probably the best game in the Watch Dogs series though and it merely depends on the player to like it, its different for everyone.

314,rhn,"Nov 12, 2020",6,"A hollow game with not only bugs, but numerous deadpan omissions. I really enjoyed the WD2 gameplay, but WDL is a huge disappointment. it feels like a junior dev team were handed the WD2 template and a few key feature ideas, and then just narrow-mindedly produced that with no critical inputs, ideas or oversight of their own. Even simple QoL features already present in WD2 are missing... Just to name a few of the problems/oversights of the game:- The much hyped ""play as anyone"" system falls flat when 99%+ of possible recruits are vastly inferior to the ones handed to you early in the game. These recruits comes with 4 useful traits, whereas everyone else you find the entire game only have 0-2(a few archetype recruits with 3 useful traits can be found at a couple places, but they all have identical traits). Ended up playing only 3 different characters the whole game.- Story becomes rather bland with extremely few actual characters to grow attached to. The plot is extremely stereotypical and trope filled. And the games major climax point(predictable as it is) is immediately and unexplained reversed.- Driving mechanics and camera are terrible and the environment dreary, causing London's streets to be a chore to traverse. Coupled with many missions being procedurally generated from random locations, you find your self traveling all across town for each stage of a mission. All this forces you to use the quick travel system instead, diminishing the value of having a sprawling city to explore. I loved exploring in WD2's San Francisco, but here I just cannot be bothered.- The in-game currency is practically worthless, since all it can be used for is buying clothes. Coupled with most collectibles being irrelevant from a gameplay perspective, exploring the map and finding these does not feel rewarding.- In-game clothing shops are not individually marked on the map, so trying to find clothing of a specific type is a real hassle.- While clothing is somewhat decently varied, things like masks are either just reskins of each other, or ridiculous looking. Again, not giving much insensitive to explore to find them.- The games music stations can only be played when in a vehicle. Apparently streaming music to your phones becomes impossible in the future... Since driving sucks, you go almost the entire game without, which is a huge loss of ambiance for a game.- Outside a narrow collection of default non-lethal weapons that can be bought from tech-points, all weapons must be found by recruiting people who have them. And the weapon system is really confusing and limited, so even when you have a recruit with a new weapon, you probably wont be able to use it on any other more useful recruits. Some weapons are unique, so cannot be shared with other recruits. Others are put into categories, so unless your recruit came with an SMG eg. he will not be able to ever use one. Even your badass hitman that wields pistols, grenade launchers, machineguns and rifles simply cannot equip an SMG.- The hacking gameplay have become way too easy. In WD2 it could be a challenging puzzle to try and play the game as a peaceful hacker, since it involved using 2 different drones, the environment etc. In WDL you can do everything(outside a few story mission) with the single Spider Drone, while your operative is parked way outside the area in safety. Just drop the spider down, stealth through the area, do takedowns with it to thin the enemy, go hack the target terminal and hide the drone while it downloads. There is simply no challenge to it.- Bugs, bugs, bugs. The game repeatedly crashes to desktop. For me it was almost always close to the end of one of the bigger story missions, that had to be done again from scratch. Gameplay is also buggy in numerous little ways. Like doing a mission to rescue someone and once they are out of the area, they stop and prompts you to talk to them to finish mission. As you finish the conversation with them, they fall through whatever they were standing on, get knocked out and injured and you fail the mission...- While it may feel like a long time due to being boring a lot of the time, I finished the game just under 40 hours. That is including exploring a lot, experimenting with recruits(basically looking unsuccessfully for other useful ones), doing all side quests and a bunch of other side stuff. And I feel like there is zero replay value(I will be going back to WD2 over this). That is too short for a big open world game at full AAA price... All in all, a rushed and shallow game that never lives up to its hype, or its predecessor. It had lots of potential, but never met it. If you enjoy the standard Ubisoft open world game formula(I do), then get it once it becomes discounted and possibly improved through updates or DLCs."

316,garethvk,"Jan 29, 2021",8,"The latest in the popular Watch Dogs series has arrived with Watch Dogs: Legion and ushers in an exciting new chapter in the series. Set in a near future London; players take on the personal of operatives for a hacker group known as Dedsec. In the aftermath of a bombing by an entity known as Zero Day in which Dedsec is blamed; London has become a police state thanks to a private security company named Albion who were installed to keep the peace. Players must complete various infiltration and hacking missions across the sprawling city to get the needed evidence behind the attack as well as correct various criminal injustices that arise during the course of the game. Since the game takes place in a very large and highly-detailed city; there are some vast distances players must travel to complete their various missions. Thankfully there are numerous cars, trucks, busses, bikes, scooters, boats, and more which can be used to navigate the city. Late in the game I became a big fan of using the Underground to move around the map and be closer to a mission objective. Once on mission players can hack security systems by completing puzzles or using a Spider Drone to navigate air vents to hack cameras and other systems. Hacking is such a vital part of the game that players will soon become very skilled at hacking security systems, copying digital access keys, computers, and so much more. One of my favorite things to do was to hack a large cargo drone and ride it to a destination. While it did move slower than other vehicle options; it did allow me to avoid many of the circular roads of London which added to the at times extended travel. Another bonus of using the drone was being able to pick up cargo from containers to construction explosives and use it as a bomber in various situations. Combat is a very big part of the game as while players can opt for stealth at times; combat is unavoidable on many of the missions. Your weapons are based on which Operative you select and they are a varied bunch. One had a pistol and a Taser while another had an Assault Rifle and a Grenade Launcher.  The diversity of weapons are as varied as the operatives as players can recruit new members by assisting and performing various side missions. This leads to one of the more interesting aspects of the game as players can opt for a permanent death or can have their fallen operatives become unavailable for an amount of time as they sit in jail or the hospital. This allows players to recruit medics and Barristers to the team as having them will reduce the amount of time that a player is unavailable for use. The game is broken down into chapters and each of them allows players to complete the main story missions but still has numerous side missions and recruiting options available. Players can also earn money by delivering packages and other activities which can be used to purchase new clothing to enhance their look and mix things up as they play. The operatives are a great mix of genders and ethnic diversity which allows players to really experience character variety which is not often seen in games. While the game had some glitches at launch a recent patch for the PC greatly improved the performance of the game and made it a highly immersive and enjoyable gaming experience. The city is so vast and as players who know Assassin’s Creed, The Division, and Ghost Recon will know that Ubisoft are masters are creating very detailed and sprawling cities. It was great fun to go by various London landmarks in the course of my missions and floating over Parliament on a drone was a great gaming moment. The game also offers a nice mix of enemies as while there are many soldiers to contend with; being able to dispatch them with weapons or hand to hand is always fun as is having to avoid a huge contingent of drones and security forces who are in intense pursuit. The game had some sound issues as I mentioned at the launch but they were resolved with a new patch and the various voices and sounds of the city combine to make a very immersive gaming environment. The graphics of the game are very solid although some of the character facial animations seem a bit dated at times but in no way detract from the game. In the end Watch Dogs: Legion is a winning new entry in the series and I look forward to the online option of the game which is due in December. 4.5 stars out of 5sknr.net"

323,marxanth,"Nov 27, 2020",5,"Worst in the series. I'll give it a 5 because it looks good but the gameplay and story is so generic.Voice acting is terrible, cringe worthy and recycled. It feels like there are 10 voice tracks, randomly matched to any character.  I had to laugh when talking to a NPC who had the exact same voice as my character. The whole having any NPC join your team gets old, really quickly. I stuck two 2 classes types, there was really no need for anyone else. It really just seems like filler.And the bugs. save bug, random crashes, random frame stutter (i'm in a i9/3080/32GB), etc etc I did enjoy that every mission allowed for different play styles.. do you want to shoot out or hand to hand combat, use bots or stealth. And again is looks amazing when its running correctly."
324,Arthur01,"Dec  5, 2020",6,"Bom, vamo lá, se você estava procurando por uma análise em Português, acabou de encontrar. História: É bem ""OK"", poderia ser boa se fosse melhor apresentada dentro do jogo. Gráficos: Assim como a história do jogo, é bem ""OK"" também, com exceção da água que é horrorosa no jogo. Física: Completamente esquisita, especialmente no carro. Bugs: Confesso que não vi muitos mas dos que eu presenciei são eles: Bug de textura, o famoso bug da moto fantasma que anda em círculos sozinha, e o jogo crashou algumas vezes também. Otimização: Deixa a desejar. Áudio (sons do jogo e trilha sonora): Na minha opinião os sons de disparos de seu antecessor, Watch Dogs 2, eram superiores, os sons dos veículos não bons e nem ruins, são ""OK"" e quanto a trilha sonora, abaixo da média. Expressões faciais e modelagem de personagens: Essa talvez seja uma das maiores bizarrices desse jogo, as expressões faciais são totalmente sem vida e a modelagem dos personagens é digna de um jogo feito em 2015. Animações: Considero ser abaixo da média para um jogo lançado em 2020. Detalhes que fazem a diferença: Essa daqui ganha sendo a coisa mais bizarra de todo esse jogo, sabe o que acontece quando vc tenta pular um muro, ou um portão que tenha lanças? NADA, o boneco simplesmente pula como se nada estivesse espetando a mão dele, é uma desatenção total aos detalhes por parte da desenvolvedora, assim como a falta de interior de lojas de roupas, a falta de estações de metrô modeladas. Serei justo também, o jogo tem seus aspectos positivos, sendo o maior deles (e um dos únicos) a representação de Londres muito bem feita, porém é uma pena que essa Londres seja tão vazia em termos de falta de NPC nas ruas e de elementos básicos de Mundo Aberto que não estão presentes no jogo. A minha nota de verdade é 5.8, porém o Metacritic não deixa colocar número ""quebrado"" na análise, então serei obrigado a arredondar para o número ""cheio"" mais próximo, no caso, 6.0."

329,Ebomb3210,"Jan  1, 2021",4,"This is a typical Ubisoft game. Decent story and map, but flawed in many ways. The strongest part of the game is the story, and that is saying something because while it has an interesting concept, it falls short in many areas due to moments of poor writing and voice acting. My favorite character ended up being an AI because all of the ""main characters"" were extremely shallow and had no depth. The final moments of the story, which were supposed to be dramatic, were ruined by poor voice acting, repetitive gameplay (I will touch on this later), and cringy one-liners. The story was interesting enough to keep me playing the game solely to know what happened to London at the end. The missions are the weakest point of the game. Every mission feels like it was literally copied and pasted from the last one. Infiltrate, hack, then leave. It took me until about halfway through the game to realize this, but once I did the entire game became a grind. I wanted to finish because the story was interesting and I like to finish what I start, but I didn't enjoy any other aspects of it. I applaud Ubisoft for trying something new with the ""Play As Anyone"" mechanic; however, this was possibly what made the game lack so much. In order to progress, you have to recruit operatives off the street, which involves the same mundane copy and paste missions from the main story. As a result of not having a main character that interacts with others, none of the characters have any depth. I also applaud the game for giving the player plenty of non-lethal combat options. I love when games do this because not all players want to run around the city as a homicidal madman. The technological aspects of the game are as bad as one can expect from a Ubisoft title. Bad optimization made the game literally unplayable at launch. When driving, even on an RTX 2080 Super, I was consistently getting 30 FPS or below. Luckily the game's optimization went from atrocious to bad with updates. Now the game is at least playable, but I don't get the performance I would expect from an RTX 3090 (I have upgraded my 2080 Super). I played with ray tracing off for the majority of the game because DX11 gave me better performance, and the benefits from ray tracing were entirely situational in this game. Sometimes the reflections looked great, other times it made the roads look like a mirror with a bright light reflecting up at you. Plus DLSS made all of the reflections fuzzy, and DLSS is needed to play with RT on. Water always looked horrible with RT on. The game took me around 25 hours to complete and has very little replayability due to the linear story. So this means that I essentially paid $2.40/hr for a mediocre experience. Conclusion: Don't buy this game for $60. Wait a year until there's more content, optimizations, and then wait until it's on sale for $20."
330,Taavetti1983,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"I have to Defend this Game! Most Negative reviews are just Lies on this. Must be a Hype, organized mob to Attack Ubisoft. It has improved Loads since release and feels very Smooth now. It’s not the strongest story but it’s what Games should be and that’s fun. I do wish that they would Push this series more towards WD1 as that was more bad ass. My score is based on the Game and not judging it cording to a franchise. It’s a darn beautiful open-world playground to have fun in. You get a lot of gameplay nothing amazing but everything ok/Good Level. It does not really introduce it’s mechanics in the best way but you need to kind of find a handful of npc’s that you really enjoy, and this might take some time. Shooting is for sure one of the weaker aspects of the Game. A Game like this would have needed the immersive rag-doll physics, but instead it’s more arcady and yeah you can shoot NPC’s a few times before they go down. But this is Common these days as every game is getting designed to have a Online Mode. I felt more Stealthy on this than AC: Valhalla. I must admit the Stealth is not bad as you have the Hacking to Support you, and yes the Takedowns are Very Cool. You have all sorts of ways to do things, use you imagination.All in All if you play this by using your own imagination and make your own game, then you have a whole City as your Playground. If you come for a story to blow your mind and take you by the hand from the beginning to the end, then No it’s not this Game. It’s also a Unique Open-world title, one of it’s own Kind. 8/10"
331,Zellar,"Jun 16, 2021",8,"I bought the game for 599 rubles, for a long time I did not dare to buy it because of the previous part of watch dogs 2, which took place with a friend, it was very boring, but after the purchase I was not disappointed in the purchase. The plot is rated 6/10, a classic plot to save London from oppression. I think I will note only the disadvantages, since everyone will find the pros themselves. Among the disadvantages, you can note the weak artificial intelligence, often there were funny moments and strange disappearances or appearances of people (when you start fighting with the enemy, he can disappear somewhere or just suddenly appear)"

The graphics look amazing at 3440x1440p my 5700XT is running this game at 60FPS very high settings. Gameplay is also great and the missions for recruiting people have so far been quite interesting.

Story was honestly kinda boring in Legion, but it had it's moments, some missions were better than others, but that's same with every game i think.

340,Maxkho,"Nov  9, 2020",10,"Positives:- London looks incredibly realistic, to the point that it sometimes trips you out because your brain is convinced that it's witnessing real-life footage. The environmental graphics are gorgeous - but make sure to play with the highest graphics settings and ray-tracing on, or the experience won't be the same.- The general atmosphere of the world is spectacular, and the general London feel is captured perfectly. If you have ever lived in London, the game will unconditionally make you feel nostalgic. Everything - down to small details like advertisement style - has been thought out to make you feel like you are living in the same city that, 15 years ago, was the London that we read in the news about today.- The recruitment mechanic is fantastic and works just like advertised. Every NPC in the game (apart from a dozen story-specific characters) is recruitable, and actually feels like a distinct individual with their own set of strengths and weaknesses, personality, and a complex life behind them. Every NPC has a detailed biography and everyday schedule, and which NPC you recruit has noticeable effects on the gameplay: the same mission can be an exercise in stealth, a full-blown firefight, a sniper-like quest, or even a drone war depending on which character you decide to complete it with. This, in conjunction with the game's general sandbox mechanic which makes the open world malleable and dynamic, provides numerous opportunities for you to express your creativity and play the game like you want to play it.- Some of the chapters (notably the Skye Larsen and Dedsec chapters) were captivating and featured genuinely thrilling storytelling.Negatives:- The character models, as well as their movement, animations, facial expressions, and lip-syncing are seriously outdated. It can be pretty weird seeing these comically poor characters interact with such an advanced and almost photorealistic environment.- The voice acting is some of the worst that I have ever seen. For some characters, I feel like a random person on the street would've done a better job. Besides, the accents of the characters match neither the characters' personalities nor, even more noticeably, the general London population. For some reason, Ubisoft seem that London is inhabited almost exclusively by native Patwah or Polish speakers, which is obviously wildly inaccurate; on the other hand, the massively popular MLE dialect is barely featured at all. As a consequence of all of these factors, immersion - and with it the otherwise wonderfully executed illusion of being in futuristic London - takes a massive hit.- The AI is bad. Albion staff won't shoot at you even after you have literally almost killed them; they won't spot you even if you are in their plain sight; and the less said about vehicle AI - which would be underwhelming even in year 2000 - the better.- Melee combat is very primitive, although most other combat mechanics are pretty good.- Other than a few thrilling moments, the general storyline is basic, and almost all missions follow the exact same format: break into building - kill a few guards - retrieve artefact - possibly survive ambush - escape to safety. The game starts to feel repetitive after a few such missions - especially given that completing a mission is a prerequisite for every new recruitment, which is honestly a bit of a nuisance.- I can't help but feel that much, much more could have been made of the amazing open world that Ubisoft has built and the recruitment system available at Ubisoft's disposal. The characters could be grouped into different classes, with more powerful classes having more demanding recruitment criteria; the missions could be designed to encourage us to interact with the game-world more - for example, some missions could require us to recruit a particular type of character, say a cryptocurrency analyst, so we would be encouraged to recognise that cryptocurrency analysts usually work in the types of skyscraper found in the City, and go look for them there; hell, they could even go crazy and establish a relationship system, whereby relationship points would be gained by engaging in the appropriate activities with them (e.g. taking them to some cafe in the city or engaging in a brawl) based on their profile. Unfortunately, none of that has been done, and the best recruitment strategy as of right now is simply to find the character that you want to recruit in a place you'd expect them to be and recruit them. Only a few types of character are actually worthy of being recruited, with the rest being completely useless, and the recruitment itself is monotone and repetitive. Additionally, not much has been made of the highly interactive open world, and there is a lot of untapped potential. All in all, Watch Dogs Legion is definitely worth trying out, and it's a fun and immersive experience. However, it's certainly got its flaws, and it could have easily been just so much better."

345,realreviews2020,"Nov  8, 2020",9,"I have strong mixed feelings about this game. First off, it's all there, npc recruitment, London in all it's glory, everything that was in trailers, everything they promised, it's all there.Now, let describe this open world London and stuff i like about it and stuff i don't like at all.This game misses main character, i'm sorry to say that, but it does. I can't wait to see if anything improves when they release season pass with Aiden, but it must. I would absolutely love to free roam with Aiden in that city. I guess what i want is actual character focused story. Right now it almost feels like it's work in progress and they should have released Aiden day 1 as post-story content. Like if you finish main story, then you can play with Aiden basically, well they didn't do that and i can live with that, i just hope season pass delivers, i really do. And why am i so optimistic? Because at the same time, there's so much there. This city really looks beautiful, for example you can go on cargo drone and fly on top of almost any building (that isn't too high) and chill around there. Scenery is BEAUTIFUL. You can free roam around on these rooftops, explore them etc. But then i have some criticism against open world design choices, for example i was free roaming and i found this old train in middle of nowhere, Would have been so cool to go inside it and explore it, but you can't because it has no doors. It's not the end of the world, but little things like that could have been so much deeper. You can drive inside trams in WD1 and you can't even go inside old train? Just saying. But overall it's not trash, it's just not. It' might not be anyone's cup of tea and that's completely fine, giving it just zero is pathetic at best. I'll just be honest, driving sucks with mouse and keyboard, it actually felt better in WD1 and they need to fix this, i'm serious. Overall it has tons of potential, underground areas is nice idea as well. There's so much there and there's stuff that i can forgive, like i don't NEED to go inside old trains, it would be just cool, that's all i'm saying. Overall again, it's not trash, it's just not. It just need improvement and for the love of god it needs that season pass more than ever."

I've seen other reviews say that the ""recruit anyone"" thing sounds good on paper, but I think it was a bad idea ever at the drawing board. Hands up who has ever been interested in playing as Johnny NPC in any other title? A lack of a main character makes it very difficult to get emotionally invested in the story. All these cliched schmucks are just paper cutouts. More repetitive and boring gameplay, and a driving mechanic that somehow manages to be worse than the previous two games. I know, I didn't think that was possible either, but they somehow managed to pull it off. Not a fan of the push towards non-lethal methods either, which continues from WD2. Just let me air people out with an assault rifle, I have zero interest in being a soft cuddly goody two-shoes. *WOEFUL* PC optimization. I should not be having to turn settings down on an i9 with an RTX 3090 in an attempt to maintain 60FPS @ 4K. Shockingly poor voice acting and direction; we're talking Oblivion-level voice ""skills"" here. Facial animations are plasticy and unrealistic too. I guess they must have been taking lessons from early 2000s Bethesda. On the plus side, the recreation of London is attractive and interesting, even if I do wish it included more areas out to the east. In the end I ditched the story and gameplay itself and just went for a wander around some old haunts. Much more fun. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this."

He doesn't care that many people were waiting for this game or that people know the difference between GTA series and Watch_Dogs series. All ""penguinz0"" cares about is whining about Ubisoft as much as he can. It's sad that he is that way and it's sad that people like him have that much power to destroy great games, but that's the reality we live. Watch_Dogs: Legion is solid by the way."
371,weebe,"Nov 16, 2020",3,"Not terrible, but coming off of watchdogs 2, it just isn't satisfying. watchdogs 2 (in my opinion) was a great game for what it was, characters with personalities that feel genuine, like an actual geek in SF, while not exactly an accurate representation of SF, it was close enough. The problem with legion is that it just is far too repetitive with its missions, in watchdogs 2, you had cyberdriver or the one where you EMP a factory. Compared to legion, legion has mainly spiderbots and not much else, the games story missions are mainly just repeated ""get in and out"". While 2 did have a ton of these, at least it had some variation in between, like cyberdriver, whcih ends in an insanely fun chase and tidis, whcih lets you control a war machine."

382,protestingmoose,"Nov 16, 2020",9,(Finished the game) It seems that the user score for this game is much lower than it should be. The devs introduce a truly incredible mechanic with the rogue-lite inspired recruitment system. It's precisely when you lose one of your most beloved characters permanently that you realize just how interesting this mechanic is. This is the first game in a long time that actually made me think about the consequences of in game events and the sacrifices that individuals must make to accomplish a common goal. Definitely worth a play through.

388,PowerGamer,"Jun  5, 2021",0,"In summary: A soulless, woke, game that wants you to like communism. Instead of waiting at least a week for reviews I got this game since I got a new RTX 3080 card and wanted to see what the raycast effects looked like. Disappointed (when it came out last October) to find that the online play wouldn't be available for months. One of the great features of WD2. First odd thing I noticed is the character generation. You have to choose from one of several randomly generated choices. You skin color, sex, etc., and you can't reroll to get another random set.If you are not satisfied with the random choices you get, you go play through the intro mission again.Hello I'm random, are you random too? This is so strange and offsetting. Why do I want to play a game where I'm just some rando?In real life I can just go walk around a shopping mall and merge into the crowd if I want that. Then you can play as another rando operative, the pick more rando NPCs so you can play them.Who in the hell wants to play this?People want to play someone special, the hero, etc., they want to be a meaningful protagonist or antagonist.Why can't we just play Dalton (the interesting James Bond like guy in the intro)? This game is the sign of the times where some purple hair, weed smoking, androgynous, birkenstock wearing SJW designer(s) are let loose on Ubisoft whom must have fully embraced woke culture. Let's make a game with ""unity"", were we are all the same; man, woman, thing, short or tall, any melatonin (yet disproportionately dark) shade. Utopia is here! Weeee! Sure London looks pretty, but it's all soulless, lacks character, boring, and directionless.Better off playing WD2 again and hope they come to their senses and recover with a decent WD4."
389,LongShot24,"Nov 18, 2020",3,"Fun game but broken as hell. After many, many crashes, I lost 16 hours of gameplay to a corrupted save. Ubisoft seems to have forgotten about this game with the release of Valhalla. WTF?"
390,TsukasaHiiragi,"Nov 19, 2020",6,"Pro's Ability to recruit any NPCAccurate representation of London Con's Buggy and prone to crashingToo much recycled contentJanky vehicle controlsLess gameplay features than Watch Dogs 2Stupid AI Watch Dogs Legions is a disappointment, and honestly feels like a downgrade from Watch Dogs 2 in  every way possible,  driving feels sluggish and janky with no impact damage and significant recycled content over and over feels like them mission structure was just copy/pasted too many times. Graphically speaking, Ubi did a great job of rendering a fairly accurate London and I'm British and visited London many times, its attention to detail is well above par and I think that is where the problems start, I think they spent too much time on eye candy. Gameplay wise, it's still watch dogs at its heart with the ability to make your own fun in the open world,  travel around and explore and do all the typical side content you would expect in an open world Ubi-soft game,   the problem I personally have with Albion who are the paramilitary organization that framed Dedsec this time around,  the problem is they are either extremely overpowered and at the same time, dumb as two rocks. The case of being overpowered is simple, when your driving around London, Albion pursuit cars will spawn frequently 'just popping up' out of thin air to ram you at ridiculously high speeds, speed these chases makes it nearly impossible to use hacking to move cars away from you, or too activate pillar traps like in Watch Dogs 2 which made for some entertaining and satisfying escapes,  and trying to disable drones whilst driving is even more frustrating then once you hack a cargo drone and fly away Albion suddenly can't do anything to stop you escaping,  in fact travelling by cargo drone quickly becomes the defacto method to travel around the city. The ability to recruit everyone is entertaining for about 10 minutes, getting an old 80 year old to fight is comical at best, and essentially pointless at worse when you can find specialists who actually have helpful abilities.   The skill tree is also significantly dumbed down again for Legions mostly revolving around the ability to hijack Albion drones being the most useful. Overall, its a passable game but significantly weaker in every department than Watch Dogs 2.   I'll be honest and say that covid-19 probably didn't help the development of this game at all, and it shows."
391,Eloco-Rinn,"Dec 12, 2020",8,"A good idea and a short but intresting campain that has some good chapters, tho it could have benefited from more development time since the game has little to do after the short story and the little sidequests. Maybe the DLC will make it feel more complete, but that should be in the vanilla game.But with all, it is a fun game and has more to say than that other cyberpunk game that came this same year..."

I would rather have one main character such as Aiden Pearce that you can actually be emotionally invested in and care about. Idgaf about these randoms characters or tbh the story which I got bored of very quickly. AI is also dog **** an example is me stealing a bus with the cops behind me but if I just stopped the bus the police would just sit in the car behind and do nothing like wowww so immersive. Stealth also not that great which is a shame, again preferred it in the og watch dogs.Only positive I can give is the game looks pretty good, but paying nearly £60 for this really ain’t worth it"

409,barrybassline,"Nov 29, 2020",10,"Reading through the reviews and what hasn't been mentioned is how closely the London modelled in this game actually resembles real London, it's genuinely breathtaking at times, yesterday I walked to such a close recreation of dinerama in shoreditch [link omitted per site rules] I just had to stop playing, the same for the south bank food market, in fact across the whole game, this really is London you are playing in. Brilliant. So much fun, on to the game This isn't GTA the story is much deeper, its based in a v for vendetta style dystopian future London, the range of characters is good, the irish and northern irish accents are brilliant except brogue north dublin (I dressed those guys as grannies as north dubliners exude toxic fake masculinity). The drones are superb fun. I'm having the best time. There is only one glaring fault, london taxis have the shortest turning circles of any vehicle in the game this isn't replicated, other than that this is a fab game and the dev team fully deserve plaudits."

413,MadKat187,"Dec  7, 2020",1,Looked like a fun game and I enjoyed the first bit of it that I played right up until it deleted all of my progress because its broken on Series X/S. Save system is completely broken on the new console and makes the game unplayable. It has been multiple weeks now and Ubisoft still has not released any type of fix for such a huge issue. Do not buy this game until Ubisoft fixes it. The only reason I gave it a 1 instead of a flat 0 is because what I played of the game itself seemed fun right up until I lost multiple hours of progress and had to do it all again.
414,wolfmaster8,"Dec  7, 2020",3,"This is sold as a completely new adventure on Watch Dogs saga. Reality is more the contrary of that. it implements new mechanics, a lot of new characters but, I have some points I consider relevant when buying a new game from a franchise. TL;DR: it's an interesting approach, but it's Ubisoft: Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V while changing the map, the story, new characters and adding some new mechanics. But it feels like the same. They didn't improved the graphics quality, the driving system is terrible, some good mechanics from the others games disappeared. 1. Map & Ambient: I don't know if London was the best choice, but the ambient is always dark, rainy, and when it's sunny it feels odd, like a yellowish ambient. Night is more vibrant, so it's not that bad. However, I think, Future London is well executed and sometimes it's awesome to see all the details on every corner of the map. 2. Driving: it feels like driving in GTA Vice City (and that could be offensive haha). They didn't upgrade the driving mechanic for this game and personally it feels worse than Watch Dogs 2. Also, the cars are too slow. I think, that was a decision based on the size of the map, but even with the fastest cars, it feels like 30mph. 3. Graphics: what a disappointment! With a high-end PC and a good ultrawide gamer monitor, in some scenarios it feels like a game from 2012 or something. I think the lightning system is not good. With HDR and without it, after adjusting everything, the colors, the light, the shades and the characters seems to be from another decade. Games like Farcry 5 or even WD2 have a better graphic system. Sometimes GTA V feels more recent that WDL. 4. Missions: a really interesting story, but more of the same mechanics. Enter a building and hack a computer, hack a server, steal something... It has new things, but it lacks of innovative things to do. 5. Recruit characters: I find this was a really good step on the franchise. It's really funny to enter the prohibited buildings with a character that is an employee of that company. However, the missions to recruit are too repetitive. 6. Characters: I love how every character has a life in the game. On the bad side, sometimes the voices doesn't represent the character. 6.1. NPC's: How it's possible that in 2020 the NPC's get stuck in a wall while walking? Also, the police/chases are a little bit buggy. For example, I entered a forbidden building and the guards saw me and started to walk away running. Another: I was being chased by the police and I hid on a wall while they were looking at me, and that was it, I lost the police. Disclaimer: Probably they are gonna fix that behavior, but in the meantime I'll leave this here. 7. Interface, Gameplay & Controls: The interface is well designed but they changed too much the controls and the mechanics of them. After more than a month playing, some things on the gameplay feels awkward. Now our character doesn't have a cellphone, so in order to, for example, take a picture, you need to hold X and then press 9 and then the camera will show up that's not intuitive. It feels awkward to do that. A cellphone was a better idea, maybe with an holographic screen to be more futuristic. 8. Price: I don't know why I payed too much for this game. This game is overpriced if it's sold as part of WD franchise. If this was sold as a new franchise, maybe the price would be correct. Things to consider before buying.1. If your are new to the franchise it will be worth it.2. If you had played WD1 and WD2 I will consider buying the game on sale."
415,UEKY,"Dec  8, 2020",1,"【Good Point】1. Graphics is clear and great (Couldn’t feel the good point of Ray Tracing though...)【Bad Point】1. Story was really worse. Couldn’t even understand the ending why did she betray and kill her self. Also recruiting story is ordinary and doesn’t have an unique story on each person.2. There’re so many bugs prevents story progress. For example what I experienced was fell down to underworld while going up stairs and rebooted game for triple times.3. There’s no gun can damage NPCs. Need to hijack enemy drones and this is really boring for those who may want to shoot and kill.4. Hacking is downgraded. As other person mentioned, player can’t use their mobile to hack traffic lights or manholes.5. First person view while driving is not implemented.For those reasons, this game is not worth to spend almost $60 and should not buy."
416,bruh_219,"Dec  9, 2020",8,"While i personally found the game almost perfect that's probably because 1. I like the series 2. Like the whole NPC controlling idea. The recruiting system is okay, recruits are usually the same par some exeptions, however finding the recruit is always fun. Gunplay and driving is decent, story while worse than 1 better than 2, world looks good, but game is brought down by bugs and performance. Overall if ubi fixes the bugs i recommend it wholeheartedly."
417,xirb,"Dec 10, 2020",4,"For the first 6 hours or so I was quite entertained. But now, after about 18 hour, Im not really enjoying it anymore.The game gets boring and feels empty.

And the selection of gadgets and abilities fells limited. There has not been a single moment where I felt connected to the character."

The plot of the game seemed to me quite good, but no more.The graphics are better. And London looks great too. What about the main feature of agent recruitment, then it works. However, no one forces you to knock them out like Pokemon, you can follow the story. The necessary ones will be given as you progress.In the game I was upset by the AI. He's not too smart.Driving remains the same as Watch Dogs 2, but better. In general, Legion left a surprisingly pleasant impression.

424,Renegade01MB,"Oct 30, 2020",7,"Legion doesn't do much to improve on the foundation made by WD2. Parkour system is exactly the same although somehow not as cool. Gunplay too also saw no changes, infact there's less variety in weapon selection because of the ""play as anyone"" gimmick which leads to other problems i will touch on later. The story suffers from the USP of the game since there are only roughly 10 unique voices in the game and the voice acting isn't very good either. Lines are copy and pasted and repeated throughout missions. The bad voice acting detaches you even more from the cast of recruits, especially when the voice doesnt match the face and Why is half the population of London from Ireland?With hacking there is some more features since the story has a big focus on his autonomous drones, but still this aspect is mostly untouched. On a less important note the character face models are definitely not ""Next gen"" they are on par with Assassins Creed Unity faces and that game is 6 years old. This is obviously due to the fact that they did not go for a single main protagonist so they had to make sacrafices in that department in order to make every NPC face somewhat ""good"". However aside from the face models the game is gorgeous especially at night time with ray tracing on.Speaking of performance the game runs like **** I have a Ryzen 7 2700x, RTX 2070 and 16GB RAM, running the game at 1080p medium-high settings with ray tracing on and i only average 35 FPS.Gameplay. Although not much has changed since WD2 the gameplay is still fun and addicting, the open world feels very much alive and the aesthetic of near futre London does look amazing. However the game lacks a variety of enemy types, Albion solders, police, and gangsters all behave the same, you have a shotgunner to rush you and machine gunners, drones aren't really a threat since hacking them is as easy as abc. There is a new combat system however, its not too deep and for some enemys your only option is to rinse repeat the SINGLE counter animation until there health bar depletes then finish them off. Gunkata takedowns are sexy though.On the brightside the variety in Operatives to play as will make you approach missions and outposts differently since they offer different special abilities. Alot of the more common NPCs are all just copy pasted with different character model and proffesion.Clothes customization sees an improvement with loads more ways to dress your character and the abundance of shops on every high street adds to the realism.Many times I've been walking the streets and random NPCs will just fight or pull a gun and try to rob one another, or when finding your first Spy outside the MI-6 building and overhearing their convesation on the phone with one of ther apprentices in the field. Multiple albion hostages detained on the streets, even the occasional ""sorry"" and ""suck your mum"" which as a brit myself can confirm is all we say to eachother. It all feels alive.Driving still sucks in Watch Dogs, do I need to say more?This is another sort of nitpick but since the start of the game its been very hard to find male ""Skilled"" operatives. I myself am a man so ofcourse I prefer to play as a man, and I was never really excited about playing as anyone, like who wants to play as a construction worker or beekeeper? So I wanted go find some hitmen and Spys to play as but oh no, Ubisoft is shoving female characters down my throat with force. The Spy, Hitman and Anarchist you get for defying their respective boroughs are all female, again this isnt really an issue but like i said I want to play as male characters and is a tad annoyingOverall this game is very mixed. I do enjoy my time playing although not much has been changed gameplay wise, the world is immersive and gorgeous, but driving sucks and with the abundance of fast travel points why should i drive? The story is lack luster and voice acting is terrible. I'd say do what I did and buy Uplay+ for a month its only 13 quid if you wanna play the game DO NOT pay full price its not worth it and if you dont have good specs on your pc dont expect to tmrun high settings and or get above 60FPS."
425,DixreuX,"Oct 31, 2020",7,"I wanted it to be more, but its still a good game.It seriously needs more depth and optimization. The good:-Combat, stealth and gadgets feels good and realistic-Driving is ok, but i didnt use it as its a horrible city to drive in-I liked the story, and it even **** me a little-The recruitment system is good-i like the swearing, british voices and humor in this game-Missions feels diffrent when playing as a different character-Graphics are good if you have a decent card The bad:-When the melee system takes up a lot of the gameplay it need to have more depth and variation, ecspecially in bare knuckle boxing.-i spend to 10+ hours looking for a good melee combat character, a female hitman, and a decent looking spy and i couldnt find any of them (as i didnt like the characters i was forced to pick)-HORRIBLE PC optimization-Recruitment needs more depth (specificly to make them better, more unique, can switch weapons and gain new skills, maybe by training the skill you want?)-Enemys just stop coming when invading enemy territory-No parkour-None of the cool hack from WD2 like blackout and call gang members/police-When an area is liberated Albion dissapears from streets which removes the tension and the cool interactions with citizens."
426,Visitor7509,"Nov  9, 2020",1,"In this game, in fact, there is nothing high-quality for 2020! There is no London underground-it is only as a rapid transfer to the outside) No trains in motion and use! No vehicle control physics and graphics from upgrading sucks! The plot was invented by a madman and a fool! I'll Tell you what this new deception was created for-the game will do::: Every year some smart tricks from Ubisoft to get more money from a ""casino type game"" they have created. Kids (also adults and every gamer) should not buy this game as it contains micro transactions and this model must be disallowed to exist as it is considered gambling. The company makes billions on this shameful game . It is called stealing in disguise and Nations must end this for the world of gaming."
427,LawrenceP,"Oct 31, 2020",4,"I feel so disappointed by this game that i felt compelled to make an account to tell you how bad it is. The good:- Graphically, its pretty good. A lot of people have talked about issues with performance, but from what i can tell that was patched out before i purchased the game.- The recreation of London is pretty good - even some buildings that are not landmarks (but most people will recognise if you've walked down the street) have some good and faithful portrayals here.- From memory, WD1/2 did not have any kind of flying mode, which this game has added, its pretty cool to see London in the 3rd dimension. The bad- The story is horrifically bad, DEDSEC has been framed for the killings of thousands of people across London in 3 terrorist bombings, and you can just walk the street asking if people want to join. Throw in the hilariously bad recruitment missions and people sign up willingly. Imagine if ISIS approached you, roughed up your old boss that you didn't like, and you accepted that as justification and reason enough to join the most wanted terrorist group in the UK. - The recruit anyone mechanic isn't very clever. There is absolutely no reason to do anything with anyone other than the person you start with. The abilities you get are minor % increments over the base stats, meaning you can spend 3 hours to find the perfect recruit, and you've completely offset any gains of having them. The recruitment missions are long winded and silly, and repeat regularly, with even the same building, dialogue, objectives. - The recruit anyone mechanic has some very serious downsides, these include TERRIBLE facial animation as they have tried to make 15 or so voice actors hit a million randomly generated NPC's, and it just delivers terrible terrible results, its massively immersion breaking. It might be ""Funny"" having an 80 year old white woman talk like a 20 year old Roadman, but it wears off very quickly. -  You cannot develop your operatives at all,what you recruit is what you get. You can unlock more weapons and gadgets, but that's it.Its all done through a central tech purchasing menu and applies to all operatives. - The main downside is that you're robbed of a good character, Aiden was a bit bad i admit, but I genuinely liked Marcus, i don't care about any of the operatives as they are immediately replaced, just cannon fodder. Though, they'll only ever die if you do something monumentally stupid or if the game somehow breaks and just spontaneously blows up your car...again. - Every single line of dialogue has some terrible joke in it, its constant, never ending. If they're not making some terrible joke, its some inane political commentary. ""Oh haha, that guy is about as popular as a french football team"" or ""Searching for footage of police brutality, this might take a while...Oh, that was easy"". It's constant. - Fundamentally, at its core, its just a boring game. The gameplay loop is a simplified version of the previous games, with a lot functionality removed, and I'm not entirely sure why. A lot of the special ability hacks in previous games have not been carried over to this one, such as blackout, or my personal favourite call police/gang members to harrass people. - The new ""improved"" melee combat is a bit half baked, every single opponent has the exact same fighting style, meaning that after you've fought two enemies it becomes telegraphed and you can set your watch to what the npc will do next. It plays like an old Assassins creed game, dodge counter, dodge counter. - The addition of ""Health"" to NPC's is not a wise choice, enemies survive head-shots, the pseudo realism of the combat of previous games was one of the best aspects, i'm sad that it has been MMO'd like the Division with kids in hoodies having health bars equivalent to being in full riot gear. -The physics are dreadful, the driving is terrible, spongy, and just doesn't work. They largely fixed the driving in WD2 so not sure why its gone back to the way it was previously. - The police are so laughably bad, you can go on a melee rampage but as long as you don't pull a gun nothing will happen, if it does, the police will spawn 15 feet away from you and you just drive around two corners and you're home free. - The radiant AI is horrific. You'll walk down the street and everyone is calling you, or someone, a prick, a wanker, or all sorts of horrible language that's okay in moderation but its CONSTANT. Literally every NPC you walk past on the street is shouting curse words, its insane. I've just ranted a few of the key things that have really disappointed me, i've not even mentioned the fact that you can use the construction drone to basically ""Skip"" most of the game, land next to your objective, hop off, press Y and fly off into the sunset. If UPlay didn't have terrible DRM policies i would refund it, but i cant. Wait till its £5 on those black market CD key sites, then still don't buy it."
428,Gr442lt,"Nov  4, 2020",4,It doesn't get any better from the previous part of the game. It's a depressing plot and character models are scary to horror. Graphic transport looks awful. The plot is idiotically stupid.
429,FunkyMonky,"Oct 31, 2020",3,"This is a perfect example of an ubisoft game. Full of all kinds of systems and mechanics with interesting concepts, but that have the depth of a puddle. This makes the game become repetitive and bland so fast. The core gameplay loop, while it does work, it's so uninspired and executed so poorly that I wonder if they've even playtested the game . If you want to play a game with a recruitment system that is actually done right and that keeps you engaged, go play Middle Earth: Shadow of War and don't waste your time and money on this."

434,Steyraus,"Oct 31, 2020",3,"Why is this franchise even still going, the first game was OK the second was a flop and has all the same issues this game has.Another generic, repetitive open world chore from Ubisoft. Cut and paste assets AI from the first AC games  still walking into walls and acting in ways that is completely immersion breaking. The whole game has a district lack of attention to detail and polish. So many games this generation have pushed the medium of gaming forward in meaningful ways but Ubisoft one of biggest, richest publishers continues to give us uninspiring out of date trash..Sure they pull a rabbit out of their hats occasionally but overall enough is enough.Literally the only thing that could be innovating is the ability to play as any character and even that is rubbish. Everyone in this world is ugly and idiotic, could not find a single character I was invested in and the whole system is just shallow RNG tricks.The worst and most unforgivable thing about the game is its creator stubbornness in bring a 60fps mode to next gen consoles. Apparently it got ray tracing and runs in 4K, how hard would it have been to lower the resolution to 1440p and remove ray tracing for a Smooth experience. Once the new machine are out I wont buy a single game that is running a 30FPS. They dont have the CPU to blame anymore and consumers should expect better."

I have a 3090 and a 9900K and playing the game maxed out WITH DLSS in ""balanced"" gives about 60FPS average...in the benchmark. The moment I got into a vehicle past the tutorial the game can barely maintain >30 FPS. On top of that, it looks like garbage. At least when Crysis melted my computer in 2007 it actually looked good.Oh and the story has absolutely no hook, it's extremely generic.I didn't bother with the gameplay because it also seems pretty generic and boring.Garbage."
437,FaintKarma5,"Oct 30, 2020",5,"As a person who loves story overall, this game is depressing. The story is bland, the voice acting reminds me of oblivion, and as we all know oblivion isn't really know for great voice acting. This makes me sad especially since I was hyped for this games story. I loved AC Odyssey's story and hoped Ubisoft finally learned how to write, Alas I was wrong. The gameplay is fine, But it misses the feeling of truly fun gameplay because of how little you can mess with stuff by hacking, in WD 2 you could call the police on someone, Start a gang war,  but in not in this game for some unknown reason . The gunplay is Fortunately far better in this one than in the previous installments. And I will admit, A military state London is far more appealing to  look at than I thought. But that is all this game really has going for it, It's bland and really just flat out not fun to play. Not even worth buying on a sale. If I were you dear reader, I would distance myself farther from this disappointment of a game, No keep going, Further, Almost, Little further, Right there!

442,Lumirel,"Oct 30, 2020",5,"I was really looking forward to this, but I should have hesitated with pre-ordering it. Sadly as I expected from ""play as anyone"" it had its downsides that kicked in after few hours of gameplay, but well, lets start with posivites. Positives:- London looks awesome- Graphics are somewhat bit better than in WD2 (also goes to negatives with framerate)- Gameplay is addictive- It's cool to be able to pick anyone on street- Recruitment missions are fun- City is alive, a lot of stuff is happening on streets- A lot gadgets to choose from, a lot of cloths for operatives (visual customization)- AI protagonist is fun Negatives:- Framerate... I played WD2 week ago and it ran way better on similarly-looking settings, optimalization is just BAD in WDL- You can get anyone, but you cannot really upgrade anyone other than to give them one of few unlockable weapons and gadgets.. I hoped there will be some leveling system or way more stuff to give operatives, also having just selectable gadget at time is just not enough variety- LOADING SCREENS! They are everywhere, almost every interior has loading screens, it's just lame in 2020, when WD2 back then had a lot of interiors...- Almost no interiors other than mission one...- Operatives have bonuses but mostly you are able to complete mission or place with whatever operative- Operatives (characters) really lack depth, no levels- Lack of real side missions I wanted to really like this game, I was looking forward to it. But it really lacks depth, not thanks to the system but because noone cared about possibilities of this system - like being able to level up operatives and give them some perks, more weapons, more passive/active abilities according to their specialities. This would be really interesting to have fewer operatives but levelable in certain ways. So, ""play as anyone"" is not really bad, but the lack of depth in it is bad. I kinda lack being able to change their hairstyle and stuff as well, it's just a shame. Storywise I kinda like it, it could be better though. I was happy for AI member of team, it reminded me bit of Wrench that I liked from WD2. Give it a try when it will be for 15-20€ or get it through Uplay+, don't pay full price for it now, it is definetly not worth it."

The legion mechanics are cool in theory, but they don't actualize what they could have in this area. I played on permadeath, but I could care less about any of my recruits since I can replace them so easily. It also lessens the quality of voice acting, story, and cutscene animations.

Now this game actually plain doesn't have any actually real nature spots, and aside from that the open world is just boring and too big for it's own good. Also barely any actually fun activities to do like racing for if we want some variation from constantly shooting people. There are also RPG mechanics now which suck, civilians don't call the police anymore like previous Watch_Dogs games. Voice acting is horrendous and the game is extremely buggy. Game is also HORRENDOUSLY optimised and they removed shop interiors. This entire game is just a massive downgrade from Watch_Dogs 2 really and I advice you to stay away at the moment.

Hacking stuff as always is a treat for awile and the driving was solid but like most Ubisoft games there is a good game hidden under meh design. Id wait for this one or do the Upass so you dont have to drop 60 on it.

New Ubisoft game = Generic repetitive gameplay and terrible performance. You delayed the game for a year to do what exactly? Glad I didn't pay for the game although if I had it would've been refunded but I am disappointed it was bundled with my 3080 instead of a different game. Ubisoft's next game will be Assassin's Creed Valhalla and I expect that game to be a disaster too. Ubisoft has slowly become one of the bigger jokes in the industry and its a real shame.
459,visaya925,"Oct 31, 2020",5,***Pretty Game*** I actually paid for this game because I bought my rtx 3080 fe re-sell and I must say it was a huge disappointment. The game looks very good at ultra with everything on.  It runs pretty smoothly with the right settings.  i feel the game looks better than anything I've seen on my Xbox one x or ps5 pro.  I don't understand why people didn't like the visuals. The story is bland.  It didn't pull me in.  I really wanted to like it but it just never hit for me. It's like waiting for a bass drop in a techno song and it never gets there or like driving a boosted car and the boost doesn't kick in.  I'm not sure if its because there isn't a central protagonist but the story didn't worth feel playing. The game doesn't really lead you well.  I'm not sure how to say this but some games hold you're hands too much in the early stages and there are some games where the systems just feel right and you kind of can just go in and play.  Spider-man for the ps4 felt this way.  WDL even though uses systems from many other games it just didn't feel natural.  Like collecting little side items etc didn't feel fluid. The concept of playing anyone is cool but to be honest it didn't work out.  It's too any choices.  In theroy its cool but it just didn't pan out. The driving physics are pretty good for an open-world game.  It matches a game like GTA pretty well.  The music selection was good but it would have been nice if I turned off the radio in one car it stayed off in the next car. The weapons and gadgets are fun to play.  I stealth wasn't sam fisher good but it was good enough for me.  I was pretty much able to play any style I wanted. I'm not saying this game is a pass but I think some people may or may not like it.  Its a decent game but I personally would wait for it to be on sale before I buy this game.  At this time of the year when there are other big games on the way this is a pass for me.  I would rather be playing Hades at this time while waiting for AC Valhala.  I am disappointed this wasn't as good as WD2 but I am sure glad I was able to get a refund after playing a few hours of this game.
460,Lexa241,"Oct 31, 2020",1,"So finally finished the plot in two evenings. Would like to write some words. In fact I'm disappointed with the game. Protagonists don't have own character, you fell them like functions. Yes, you can hire any of people but use only 2-3 of them. I used spy, soldier and drone specialist. Exepting medic and lawyer for passive perks. So there are three way to play, silent mode for spy, hardcore for soldier and remote access for drone specialist. About environment. It's cool , fullfilled with different people, events, drones and small details. But London with its narrows streets makes it uncomfortable to play. Plus stupid NPC's. S lot of bugs like invisible vehicles, texture stucks, and frozen videos. Plot twist also wasn't surprising for me. In substance there's no any new ideas but playing any of people. Can't recommend for buying."
461,edgomatic,"Nov  1, 2020",3,"The openworld is not really big, but as usual Ubisoft fails to give it life. Ofc there is stuff to collect but we all know how fun this is... Side characters are super cringe paired with a mediocre story makes it art to get through it. Gameplay is just lame. Either you hop around in your spider bit 24/7 or fly around in your cargo drone. Or you rush in guns blazing.Most buildings or in general the objectives rarely give you more than 2 possible  ways to solve it. Dont pay full price for this"
462,Maxmynerv,"Nov  3, 2020",2,"+ level design+ of artists Hire normal programmers so that the open world is responsive to the actions of the characters, and not passive.In the game, where the power in the city, was seized by an evil corporation, in fact, there are not any changes, what's before, what's after. All the same live their usual life and live like this, drive by typewriters, walk and other ordinary everyday affairs.DedSec is no longer fighting the system of total surveillance, even before the ""evil corporation"" it was the norm.Again, in a game with an 18+ rating, the cruelty of this very ""evil corporation"" is not shown normally. That sometimes, they arrest someone, but this is so routine and stupidly done in the game. Drones fly around in the game, but not they, not who does not react to the player's actions. Nobody cares. There are only closed areas where they somehow react to the player's actions. And why not the whole city is in the red zone and only by liberating it, the NPCs would begin to live their usual life.Most NPCs should think that DedSec is bad and only a select few NPCs should be DedSec followers. But even that is not. You did not draw any conclusions from the last part, when the system was removed there - good / bad, although it was ideal for the second part, when in part 2 the players collected subscribers and for every bad action they had to lose them. But no. Fire all those testers, kick them in the neck who tested the game for you.In this part, the world is generally passive. The game is awfully easy.NPCs absolutely can do everything, everything is the same as all other NPCs. Where is the limitation, so that each NPC could, something of its own. So that someone from the NPC does not know how to fight, most NPCs should not be able to shoot. Every NPC, EVERYONE! There should be both pros and cons. And the main disadvantage is to make it interesting to choose characters.So there are no minutes at all. There is no point in choosing someone.We are stupidly carrying out the mission of any NPC and he joins. Everything!Although it seems like the NPC has relatives, friends, enemies, but this is not as disclosed in the game. The enemies in the game are absolutely stupid dummies. Who always have their backs to the player. They raise the alarm, calm down after a minute. As well as break away instantly from the chase.Ok, this was only done in the first part, when there was constant reinforcement. When, over time, the character was found even in the car and he had to hide in garages and in the car itself. Where to do this mechanic? Why is she cut from the game? With each new part, more and more mechanics, working mechanics you Ubisoft cut out of the game. And the game turns into a dummy. In the second part, at least it was sometimes difficult. There were also armored fighters and enemies called for reinforcements. Good ""heroes"" created any game on their missions and it was not evaluated by the game. Here it is simply not noticed by the game at all. The same spider in the game is just a cheat. Who can do absolutely anything. Even the neutralization of enemies. Unlike the same machines from the last part of the game.All missions are stupidly passed by this spider, sitting around the corner, 99% of missions.There is no difficulty in the game. No chases. No cool action game.All missions in the game are divided into 3 types. I generally keep quiet about the plot - this is the bottom. For some reason, AI has been added to the game, but at the same time it has human emotions. And people are perceived as computers, with their dry answers.Even at the beginning, when we have not yet restored DedSec, we can also hack everything, control from a distance and get into cars, no questions at all. The head of DedSec is underground, but at the same time has the time and opportunity to put makeup on his face. I will repeat it again. The game lacks details. Reactions to the actions of the characters, even the confrontation in the areas of the people of DedSec and Albion after the liberation of the areas would be in place. And most importantly!!! The game lacks complexity. So that DedSec would seem to come out of the shadows, so that the system would find them, so that the reaction to offenses in the game was harder, stronger, more aggressive. To feel fear and oppression in the game. For the player to be afraid for their characters. But all this is not. Dummy game. In beautiful scenery.With constantly repeating missions in slightly different locations. A game that has a rating of 18+ but in terms of complexity, management, plot, it was as if it was created with a rating of 10+, all non-lethal weapons in the game and other boredom.It does not touch on serious topics.

Feels as if I'm driving an old car from 1960 rather than a sportscar because of the slow speed I can drive in London. Also just stop with this pathetic hipster bs - just let at least 1/2 of the people look like normal people on the street, not as if they were some future hipster models from ig.And what's with the customization of the clothes I'm wearing? I had to drive to more than five shops to find a black suit... A simple black suit. They only sell blue, green, pink shirts or any of that ordinary clothes. Just. Let. Me. Be. Anything.

And I was super disappointed.So let’s start with the good - the world is amazing!!! Dystopian London never looked so good!!! Running around Buckingham Palace was a lot of fun. My performance has been stable at High setting Intel 9700k with GTX2080, no crashes. I do occasionally get some weird audio clipping when I turn, but nothing terrible.And then there are the bad - I was really disappointed coming off your of WD2, I felt like I kept waiting for the story to start and it never did. Voice acting was flat especially compared to WD2. The recruitment feature seems really useless, I can’t really see why I would want one char over another, unless I just want a gun or a car, but I can’t see that choosing one character over another affects gameplay. With the permadeath option you want to feel some connection to these characters when they die (think SoD2), but instead it just feels like a nuisance. The lack of character progression and  stripped down tech tree, and lack of things to hack seems like a miss. Honestly this feels just predictable and not as good at its predecessorsIn short I am not sure where Ubisoft’s head was at with this game, it had so much potential, and was just a miss..."

Broken textures, broken shadows and models physics (no weight, objects flying through textures, no water splashes), lots of small and huge game-mechanic bugs.  SJW and other 'social' ideas exposed one-way and were being derided. Characters moving much worse than in any modern game (similar to fall guys, but much worse). FPS not stable even with 2080ti, broken lip-sync. AI do nothing. Looks like its not a game, its just a sandbox for role playing (further in online mode).Now for the truth. Ubiqs PAID all streamers to ad this game with strict 'rules of conduct' while streaming (they just bought them). Game was over hyped from the first cinematic trailers. The budget invested in advertising greater than invested in a game. Just think about. You pay your money not to the game designers, you pay for commercials and CGI cinematic trailers.

The game does not feel like an $89 million budget game, its boring and the missions to recruit characters are just making me fall asleep, the game feels incomplete and needs more time in the oven as somehow they made it look WORSE than the first game. The story is generic and not even worth talking about as there is barely a reason to go over it. I am pretty sure you could look anywhere online and see the downgrades of WDL, it's just a boring and overall bland game not worth $60 but maybe in the $30 range. At this point in time, it's not worth getting, wait for a sale, then maybe the game is like a 5."

Driving is just absolutely terrible and does not feel like a car at all anymore. Optimisation is even worse! How is it not possible to play on Ultra settings with a 3090??? You had months to optimise this and still runs awfully. Loading screens just kill the immersion. Fast travel everywhere... Voice-overs are bland, “cutscenes” are just tasteless. Everything about this game screams bland and tedious. Only gunplay is improved. The combat becomes one big problem after a while, every time you miss your takedown, because the enemy turned at you by 2 degrees, now you have to fight him for 3 minutes and get spotted by every enemy in the area. Really, no interiors? A 2020 game and i get interior in the first mission and thats it? Does everyone in London live outside?In my opinion the UI overlay is weird, just does not fit at all. And where did the Phone mechanic disappeared from WD2? That was such a cool thing , which got you immersed even more.MUSIC! Where the hell did all the music disappear, why can I not put on headphones and listen to music like in WD2? Besides doing missions, theres nothing else to do. Boxing for 4 rounds? Tedious and too easy. Kicking the ball for as long as you can? Are you serious?Recruitment system... you have to be joking. Yes I agree that is so cool to recruit anyone! But take out 80 percent of the NPCs because they don't have good features. No upgrades, no skill leveling, nothing. How am I going to be attached to a chracter besides him being “critically injured”? There is no emotional attachment to this game.WDL feels like a grey arcade game, that does not know what it wants from itself.

496,Moontoad,"Oct 31, 2020",1,"I'm confused by the praise heaped on this game. On the plus side, London is beautifully represented, and if you know your way around the real city you will find on foot navigation easy. Another positive is the spiderbot's ability to stealth takedown - easily the most fun to be had here. Unfortunately, there's little else of merit. Yes, you can recruit anyone - but they all play more or less the same, so there's no point. The voices are mismatched to characters, particularly by ethnicity - for example a kick-ass black dude I recruited sounds like Pee Wee Herman whilst a middle Eastern mechanic sounds like Black Panther - it's jarring and ruins immersion. The puzzles make little sense and invariably result in you clicking on things randomly, without thought, until you hit the solution. And worst of all, the game freezes and crashes a lot - but combine that with the fact that it uses a save point system that returns you to the start of any mission if there's a crash at any part of it... which more often than not there will be... this one is strictly for masochists only. The first Watch Dogs remains the best by far."

No. Is it fine for passing some time? Sure, meh, whatever.The gimmick of ""uuh you can recruit anyone"" is interesting, on paper. In-game, it stays interesting for 30 minutes. While cool that you can recruit anyone, it means that NO-ONE's interesting. You have no connection to the characters, so it's incredibly hard to make a compelling story when there's no stakes.In addition, the voice-action is the most atrocious I've ever seen. I spent an hour running around talking to people who looked SOMEWHAT okay, just to find ONE woman who had a voice I could stomach listening to. I played the whole game with this chick, completely ignoring all the special trait characters you get, because they sounded horrible.This is a ""play and forget"" title if you desperately need to pass some time."

Poor optimization?I did try to change graphics quality from max to min in a few steps but overall performance didn’t change almost at all. And I repeat it’s nvidia 3090! This game is a technical disaster. Car driving, is something even difficult to describe - weird, bad, awful - simply won't describe it. It just super retarded. I think as a developer you need to make extra efforts to make in game driving so miserable and annoying. I spent about 30 hours in the game and don't feel like running it again. It is simply not engaging and also very repetitive.

Watch Dogs 1 & 2 are way better games to play. Basically, they put all the basic features from the previous games into a perk system and removed some cool things (like calling police/mafia) completely. Oh, they also nerfed the parkour system, not the first time they do it... (Looking at you, Assassin's Creed). The game is also terribly optimized. If this is the new standard of Ubisoft, then maybe we should start dodging their games as well. Just sad what this mess of a game is. The story is non-existent, just some BS to go with their 'play as anyone' gameplay motto. Oh yea, it costs 15 EUR if you want to buy 1 'special' operator. On top of the 50-60 EUR that you pay for the game.

Думаю, игра была обречена на провал когда юбики решили убрать главного героя и сменить место происхождения с США на Европу. Зачем, юбисофт? Было очень приятно и интересно наблюдать за историями, переживаниями персонажей второй части, они имели какое-то лицо, чего один Ренч с Джошем стоили. Даже парень с синдромом Аспергера выглядит на порядок лучше чем этот аквариум, неинтересных, но при этом разноцветных как не знаю что, рыбок. В игре есть все кто хочешь: азиаты, африканцы, но нету людей европейского происхождения. Я не расист, просто должен же быть равный выбор, для всех. А не такая пропаганда какой она является сейчас.Также у игры множество косяков с технической стороны: тупой ИИ, множество багов, плохая вертикальная синхронизация.У игры, по сравнению с предыдущими частями, гораздо слабее сюжет. Как по мне, даже путь мстителей Эйдена Пирса выглядит намного интереснее чем это нечто, про вторую часть я вообще говорить не стану...У игры неплохая графика и красивый открытый мир (хотя США как локация, мне кажется, была бы уместнее)К сожалению, в игре меня порадовал только открытый мир, классная графика и в принципе неплохая локализация. С технической, сюжетной частью игра меня сильно огорчила. Всё-таки, Watch Dogs 2 останется лучшей игрой этой серии про хакеров, на ближайшие года четыре уж точно. А там посмотри что дальше будет.

They shouldn't have made it more of an open world as the franchise already was. The play as anyone mechanic works horribly: all the characters are either ugly or have bad voice modulation. The specialist characters are useless when you realise drones and spiderbots can be spawned with any character you want and they all have the same hacking abilities, creating no major difference in what character you play as. The mission's are all the same: destroying something or downloading something. It's so repetitive and there's no interesting narrative to back it up; WD2 at least made me interesting in what I was doing. The thing is, the introduction mission was so good; I got shivers when everything was exploding and the guy was saying ""no, no, no"" but then every mission after has no emotion at all. I think they made the janitor code the AI or something as whenever I got into a chase, they gave up after 5 seconds leaving me with no tension whatsoever. I wanted the permadeath and hard difficulty to increase my enjoyment but it made no difference because if I got overwhelmed, I could just run on foot or in a car and get away with no consequence or chance of getting caught. This made me so mad after watching the tipping point trailer I am a fan, I enjoyed both WD and WD 2 and felt like a badass while playing both. I pre-ordered the game and waited until midnight to play it. The setting looks amazing but it's empty when you peel the skin off (the world doesn't even change when you liberate a borough) and without a proper narrative and repetitive missions, the game suffers to unplayability. Please watch gameplay and read both positive and negative reviews that are over 6 sentences to get the information on if you will like the game or not! I should've done the same but I wanted a spoiler-free experience, sucks for me. Thanks for reading."

519,nwilloughby,"Nov  1, 2020",2,"Glad I didn't buy this game and only got a month subscription, This game comes with all the normal Ubisoft bugs, including no Bluetooth controller support, random crashes, lost progress, no advancing progress. I have redone the 404 cTOS hub mission at least 4 times and each time it refuses to save even after completing several more missions in the story line. The optimization is easily one of the worst I have ever played I cannot get above 40fps on SLI, the combat on hard is easy, the AI is terribly stupid, the driving has always been terrible in this series this game is no exception. The story is okay but mostly forgettable, I will have to watch a streamer beat this game because I don't have time to fix their game's inability to progress the story and do not have time to start the story over after 12 hours. Just when you think they make an advancement you realize they cut a ton of other features from other past games like controlling traffic lights, bank accounts, etc."

I played 2 hours in an hour, I didn't get tired of the game and I decided to kill everyone in a row, and it turned out that I killed 36 women and 21 men and I just went ahead and killed everyone in a row.

527,tshonwomble,"Nov  1, 2020",2,"Right so, let's first disregard all the glitches/bugs/technical issues that makes players want to break their monitor. Watch dogs legion is definitely top tier with graphics. Beautiful display of London and besides the player models I'd give graphics a 9 or 10/10 for legion. As for activities, although most are repetitive, they are still interesting with the amount of flexibility you have with your various operators. Still a solid 7/10. Now onto why I gave this review a 2/10. Story is meh but it's honestly not bad as some were saying. But my main problem with this game isn't the story, it's the bugs. Before the ""update"" that came in I was playing since launch and had over 20+ hours on my save file, I had dupes of hitman/spy operators and was balling with the operators I had. I literally spent hours in the start getting my operators and picking them from the hundreds on the street already. Now after the so called update, my game started to freeze (particularly when I recruited someone) and I had the infamous freeze when I tried to exit to main menu. Because of this, I had to alt+f4 or force quit my game a lot of times and that prompted me to lose progress on some parts of the game. It would range from 5 minutes to 3 hours. If ubisoft connects save cloud for legion doesn't work or is clearly buggy the least they could have done is put in a manual save option. That isn't the crux of it though. Today I was enjoying free-roaming and recruiting my last few operators. I completed most parts of the game and was really enjoying the game itself. Then a freeze and crash to desktop came. At that point, I was used to the game crashing so I booted it up again expecting to have lost some of my progress. However, when I tried to click continue from the main menu it didn't work and I wasn't able to select it. I had a sinking feeling because I knew how buggy this game was already. I went into load game and realized that my save file of over 20 hours was replaced with a new save file that had ""0hrs 0min"" of playtime on it. I had hoped that this was just a bug but when I clicked to load it, it brought me back to the prologue. Now you can see why I gave this game a 2/10. Ubisoft should really just delay the game and fix these problems that make the game virtually unplayable instead of trying to release a buggy game just to meet the deadline. Now that valhalla is coming out in about a week, I'm honestly worried about it being the same as legion in terms of technical issues. I was planning on buying it but I might just see the early reviews of the game and skip entirely."
528,Dante_Williams,"Nov  6, 2020",4,Very average game.  Missions feel very dull with no massive scale missions and you even return to the same locations for different missions. The ability to recruit everyone is cool on the surface but takes away the ability to have a strong lead character for the story which it so badly needs.  the voices all sound off for the characters and makes it very hard to like them as a character and not just a random npc off the street. Wouldn't recommend at full price or anything above 50% off.  The game is mostly busy work and if you watch a streamer or lets player go through the game you will see for yourself that its not worth it.

Keep your politics out of the game. How have the vehicle physics gotten worse over the years?!? Do a burnout and look at the smoke, compare that with a burnout from the first game. Also vehicle handling is absolute crap too, inertia, friction, traction...etc.Now let's talk about your NON-Story too woke to focus on a main character and write a story that carries any meaning because you didn't really know how to pin it down to one individual to carry your flag so you just chose the BLM riots.

The whole play as anyone gimmick doesn't add much depth either, I just stopped recruiting people after the first two and it made no difference really. It basically has no depth to it, which is a shame because the framework is there. Performance was a little sluggish on a 3080 @ 4k but I mostly did not experience the technical issues others did."
543,FaceMace87,"Nov  1, 2020",4,"Game is so boring it made me want to play Football Manager instead. The legion system is fine but it takes away any personality the game may have had. In games like this you want to be invested in the character, because of the Legion system your character just becomes one in a sea of generic boring characters with a modulated voice. All characters seem to share the same few lines of dialogues which is just another thing to add the negatives pile. With the exception of the spiderbot the rest of the tech is a pointless addition to pad out the game, everything (except spiderbot) that the tech is designed to do can be circumvented with a Hitman just using plain out bullets. Uniforms for an area make very little difference. I recruited a Buckingham Palace guard, when he wasn't recruited he could walk around fine as long as he had his uniform on. As soon as he became recruited the other guards were suspicious of me even when just walking, it makes no sense at all and you wonder why bothered including that feature at all. Recruitment is fun for the first few times but becomes boring very quickly. In short you can tell that they spent 80% of the development time and budget on the Legion system, the other 20% was to make everything else. Extremely boring generic game, do not buy until on big sale."

But the amount of stuff they got right was incredible, they made you feel like every character is different and unique. Gameplay opportunities here are crazy. This is not just about a good story with one character whom you can shoot and drive with, there is a lot of content here. Watch dogs was always different from standard open world 3rd person shooter game but this sets it far apart from any other game. The amount of freedom and time you can invest in this game is worth the 60$. This is where the open world genre will innovate itself from not being limited to one character but instead a legion of characters for you to toy with. Hats off to ubisoft for making such an interesting step forward which will now probably be credited to the next open world game which uses this idea and makes it work. But for me this is a big step forward and i hope they will keep at it with this game and its online modes. Looking forward for the future of Watch Dogs!"

562,LiamFokz,"Oct 31, 2020",6,"First game in the Watch Dogs series, enjoying it more than I thought I would, probably also cause I didn't keep my expectations too high lol. The whole concept of ""play as anyone"" seemed a bit far fetched at first, but I gotta say: they pulled it off and it works surprisingly well in the game's favor. The whole gameplay loop is good and the different ways of approaching missions, whether that's going in full stealth mode like some Mission Impossible movie or going in guns blazing, it's surprisingly flexible and doesn't keep you on a tight leash when it comes to all of that. Shame though that in all my hours I've been benching the game, I've had the same recruitment mission happen like 3 times already, and keep encountering people with the same haircut, voice, whatever. This is understandable since we can't expect a whole library of characters with the whole ""play as anyone"" mechanic, although it's just a shame since it's pretty un-immersive and there's no way to change a character's hairstyle or appearance or anything either, or at least not to my knowing. I dunno, maybe I just got unlucky too. I LOVE the world though; the dystopian future post-brexit London is great and provides such a great ambiance, it's amazing to walk/drive/swim/fly through: so many sights to see, items to collect, things to do in general, they did a great job on that whole department. The main story I haven't advanced all too far yet as of writing this review, but it's so-so in my opinion; It's pretty interesting with how it all plays out and has some interesting turns, though there are some cliché's.. Which, to be honest, is kind of to be expected with how almost nothing seems like it's original anymore these days. Regardless, I also find it disappointing the way Ubisoft and developers ""overhyped"" the storyline, praising it and saying how it's one of the best things about the game (see UbiCentral's interview with one of the people working on the game). It's a shame too that it still seems rather unpolished in certain areas, like the prestige operators I got from the Urban Jungle pack have really pixelated assets in the teams menu, some npc's bugging out or dying by stubbing their toe against a corner or something, not to mention the hours of trouble I've had to even get the game working without it crashing on me (tried contacting Ubisoft support but to no avail, since their live chat was disabled, they weren't replying to forum posts on the matter and the twitter support account didn't reply to my request to check it out or help either). Some of these little flaws I can overlook, but from a triple A game you wouldn't really expect these flaws. Not going to compare to any others in particular here, but it's just a shame that there are still this many little bugs and fixes that need to be done. I am however excited for the online content and season pass when they finally release, though I find it a shame and a bit odd they're not out yet.. Hopefully in the month or two that's left before the updates start releasing, they'll polish it up and make sure it's not that buggy or anything like the main game right now. Overall: I have enjoyed my time on it so far and will definitely be playing more, just a shame that it's not living up to expectations as much as I'd hoped."

Furthermore every mission consists of going into an area, disabling the security system that's preventing you from opening that one door that has the data that you have to download, you will be doing this 99% of the time, every hostile zone has this type of playstyle, you will get nothing else.The game offers a ""permadeath"" mode, but don't even think about turning it on, the game will glitch out 9/10 times and your character will die from bullsh**t reasons. Oh you jumped on a platform that you're not supposed to but the game doesn't tell you? Well sorry but your operative is now dead.This game also crashes a lot, if you're unlucky like me and it happens during a mission, you character might die and can't come back, so I suggest you keep the permadeath mode on off.RTX reflections make the game look cool I guess..."

572,MorganHat,"Nov  3, 2020",2,"Perhaps it's not a secret for anyone that the new part of Watch Dogs did not bode well, and was initially a failure. The problem lies in the game and game development. The game uses the same engine, due to which there is no development, the graphics remained at the level of the first part of the game. Such a wretched control of cars as in part 1. I advise you to save your money and buy something really worth your money. On the plus side, the game has become just more fun, like in Saints Row, but Saint Row is better and have more fun.Maximum, a sandbox, where you can have a little fun, and in the old games there are sandboxes and more interesting.P.S. And again, from the very start of sales, the players started having problems, bravo UBISOFT, keep it up."

574,dontcontractaid,"Nov  1, 2020",6,"It's okay. Not particularly good or bad. Some of the writing and political stuff is pretty cringe but the puzzles, hacking, drone manipulation and recruitment ""play as anyone"" system is quite cool. It has some of the same qualities of the nemesis system from the shadow of mordor/war games. A lot of the time the voice acting doesn't match the characters or the situation as everything has to be a sort of generic line since there is no main character. It seems in some ways a step back from Watch Dogs 2. No more tech tree, everything is very streamlined, no customization at the cool 3D printing station; now its all just through the menu and done at any time. Most of the hacking stuff is available right away except for manipulating drones. There's a pretty limited amount of things to unlock but it seems that it is to encourage you to go recruit more people as they have other special abilities and vehicles, weapons etc. The stuff you unlock is pretty basic and seems to serve as a baseline for your new recruits in the beginning of the game. Also, one thing i didn't like in particular is how many load screens there are. Like special events, specific mission events and going between indoor outdoor cells. Specifically the bare knuckle boxing events. You just walk up to the door, warp in to the fight and warp back out. Some of the story missions have loading screens where they could of had a simple animation. It's not a huge deal but it's these kind of things that I expect now because of other open world games of this era and it just makes the game feel low quality. All in all I am having fun but it is a bit bland and doesn't really seem like they have brought much new to the table besides the recruitment system. I pre-ordered ultimate edition and I'm thinking now that was definitely a mistake. If you get it you will definitely get your moneys worth for 60 bucks; but don't expect anything ground breaking."

Eww should joe-en Ded-Sec."" The story and driving are both serviceable but nothing special. The gameplay is very easy even on the hard setting. You can use a cargo drone to get what you want most of the time. The rest of the time you can simply go in guns blazing because the enemies are really silly (even dumber than Skyrim enemy AI). All that said, I did get up to the 404 missions (and all boroughs defiant) before I called it quits on the game, so I think the average gamer may get a decent weekend out of it before the gameplay repetition and awful voice work get to be too grating."

Even at the bare minimum graphics settings with RTX off and DLSS at ""ultra performance"" and down to jag-o-rific 1080p (likely rendering at 720p!), my frames STILL only average in the 30s and 40s with laughably low-res, MMO-worthy soup textures. The game's benchmark is very pretty and still runs quite well for me at max settings (high 40s), but is horiffically misleading as to actual gameplay performance, since it takes place in a small, curated level rather than the game's large open world. For perspective; Control, RDR2, GTAV, and pretty much every other modern graphically-demanding game I've thrown at my system runs at a stable 60 FPS in 4k, with or without DLSS. I kid you not, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 runs better at maxed-out settings on my build than Watch Dogs Legion does. Chances are this game will run perfectly stable on the upcoming Xbox Series X and PS5, which it was *very* obviously designed for; but unless you have a brand-spanking-new PC build with a CPU that's less than a year old, this game runs unforgivably poorly. Unless a major upcoming patch is on the way to take a wrench to the game's poorly-optimized graphics code, I can't recommend spending a dime on the PC version of this game."
585,8BitAlex,"Dec  6, 2020",3,"Narrative: 5/10* | Mechanics: 4/10* | Visuals: 7/10 *I'll admit up front that I was only able to play a few hours of this game before I had to abandon it completely, so take this review as you will. The game starts by throwing you into a classic British espionage but in a London completely run by big tech. Drones crowd the air, automated taxis are everywhere, and a private military group basically runs the city. As interesting as this all may seem it ends up coming across as extremely haphazard. The gimmick of Watch Dogs: Legion is that there is no main character. You represent the Dedsec organization and can recruit members to join. You then play as any of these members. This makes the game play almost rougelike. Because there is no main character it's not easy to feel involved in the story or the characters as they can be tossed aside at any moment. The quests, UI, narrative, characters, basically the entire game seems to be fighting with itself over what the vision of the game is supposed to be. The general mission mechanics are ok, a lot of the same from the previous game. You can hack stuff (cool), and you get a bunch of gadgets (cool), but the missions are so drab that none of that really matters. You end up having a bunch of tools that you don't really need but are just nice to have. The visuals are pretty average. I have the settings at absolute max with raytracing and it's nothing spectacular. I mean, it's pretty, and things are sharp but there isn't much to look at. Overall, Watchdogs: Legion is an interesting experiment trying to mix the GTA like open world games with a roguelike mechanic but the lack of any real substance doesn't make you want to come back."

Many missions can be most quickly and easily defeated by brute forcing through them with guns, by-passing all the tech/gadget stuff. What remains is simply pushing a button here or there to open doors. The game quickly becomes go here, pew, pew, open some doors, flip some switches, go there, pew, pew with an insufficient story, and a broken narrative due to playing with multiple protagonists. Some of the dialogue and characters are cringeworthy. It also took quite a lot of tweaking to get this running at my target framerate of 100 fps even using an RTX 3080. Many other players with slower CPU/RAM combinations than my own (10600K @ 4.9 GHz and RAM at 4000 MHz CL14) are CPU/RAM bottlenecked a lot of the time and can't get anywhere near that framerate."

589,kirby667,"Dec 21, 2020",4,"On a technical level it's decent. Same basic gameplay as the first two games, really almost nothing has changed with the core mechanics at all. What it boils down to: This game is like an allergic reaction to the first two watch dogs games in a lot of ways, just as 2 was an allergic reaction to 1. Watch dogs 1 was really dark and didn't end on a happy note, and the main character wasn't really a good guy but rather just someone living a risky lifestyle who became unhinged when his lifestyle actually resulted in serious consequences. Some people didn't like that (although I thought it stood out as a nice change of pace) so WD2 attempted to avoid that and overshot, becoming a game that felt like a cartoon with a completely tone deaf theme from the ground up. Legion basically tries to undo some of those mistakes by going for a sort of dark, but not too dark middle of the road approach. Seems like a good idea in theory, but there are a few issues in practice. For one, the middle of the road approach is coupled with a really generic plot, and those two factors combine to make for an extremely boring story. Add to that the play as anyone mechanic and the situation is further dragged down. A mild theme with a generic plat that doesn't even have any central characters to care about... OK so the plot is bad... but if the gameplay were good then at least it would be a fun open world to explore, however that isn't really the case either. I can't think of very many open world games that manage to look the same everywhere you go as much as this game does. Every corner feels the same. There is no meaningful variation to the look and feel of different areas of the map at all. The map could be ten times as big or ten times as small and hardly anything about the game would be different. The driving is also not good, as with all open world Ubisoft games, the physics just don't feel believable at all and it makes the driving really uninteresting. Even a boring map can be fun to traverse if the driving is fun but sadly that is not the case. Play as anyone: Seems like a cool concept at first but really, it's just a handicap to the player. In the other WD games, the player was basically a jack of all trades. In legion, the player will usually only have one or two abilities. It's essentially as if you took the player from WD1 who was great with guns, hacking, hand to hand combat and stealth and limited the player to only being able to do one of those things at a time. This could be balanced out if there were characters that could be unlocked/found that had more interesting abilities but that really doesn't feel like the case either. While there are technically some higher tier characters the game will steer you towards, none of them actually feel significantly better than any character you can find off the street which makes unlocking them feel entirely pointless and unrewarding. Other really stand out issues: The AI is bad, REALLY bad. It's as if the enemies are trying fairly hard to look away from you most of the time and very often will just end up standing in a corner looking at the wall. It's very common to be able to just walk through a base without trying to to avoid any AI and complete the objective without any enemies bothering you. I have the game set to the hardest difficulty setting on top of that. In short, everything about this game is extremely mediocre. The AI is stupid to the point of feeling broken. It's almost impressive how much this game avoids actually being fun. It feels like a quality game at first, the graphics are good and it seems like there is a lot to do at first but this game is ultimately just the sum of it's parts and all of those parts are basic at best but more often lean towards bad. I think you might like this game only if you didn't play WD1 or 2 and then you might find some of the mechanics to be new and interesting for a little while but as a Watch Dogs game I think this one is probably the worst. I thought 1 was really good, 2 was cartoony but the gameplay was still good enough. Legion manages to avoid repeating and of the major criticisms from WD 1 and 2 but in doing so they made a game so watered down that it's just not fun."

Игра ощущается как работа, как симулятор некой неоплачиваемой работы. Я хотел я отдыхать после тяжелого трудового дня, а не получать еще больше стресса. Стресс в игре бесконечен и нет места где я чувствовал себя в игре уютно.Бесконечные бои и погони - это очень выматывает и после 4 часов игры я чувствую себя изможденным и травмированным.

There are only one or two missions that stand out the rest is just your classic go there, kill enemies to clean the camp and loot/hack. No set pieces. The play as any NPC was promising but just feels gimmicky : you can complete the game without changing of character ( aside from one or two missions where the game forces you to ). I mean, they could have designed the game so that you'd really need to change charcter ! But no. Guess the writing is not the only thing that's lazy about this game. The open world lacks atmosphere : I mean it's supposed to be futuristic London, a few neon lights and self driving cars are not really impressive. The game is overall good looking but the animations look awful : they seem so dated and your character moves so robot-like ( there's your future atmosphere lol ). I put roughly 25 hours in the game and played through geforce Now so i could push the graphics and even then the game had a few crashes.

598,ekabon,"Nov  5, 2020",5,"I had hopes that Watch Dogs Legion will be a dark horse of 2020, especially considering the lack of marketing around. Unfortunately, I ended up being wrong. WD Legion feels more like a side step for the franchise then a proper new entry. And not a good one at that.As usual, Ubisoft did a great job on virtual tourism. Dystopian post-Brexit London looks stunning, especially with ray-tracing on. But that's about it for the good news.PC version is horribly optimised, even with ray-tracing off, and full of bugs. Then there's boring storyline, with unmemorable villains. Since we don't have a protagonist anymore, but can play as virtually any npc in the game, there are no well-written memorable character you would care about. Same goes for your ""gang"". Huge downgrade from Watch Dogs 2 in that regard.Then there are chacters with certain perks and skills. Most of them are useless or very limited, to the point that there is no reason for you to play as them. You can't just customise weapons anymore and can't pick up enemies' weapons either. Skills and gadgets tree is very limited and unimpressive either. It looks like they had to strip down skill and gadget tree and reassign it's elements to certain characters. For the same reason they removed weapon customisation - to make your recruits feel more unique. But was it worth it? Definitely not. I would much rather have a full skill tree and weapon customization to mix and match to my liking.AI feels much dumber than in WD2 as well. Albion patrol cars constantly have sirens on, indicating they are rushing somewhere, but they don't try to go around other cars and just stand there in the traffic. Stealing a car in front of Albion officer doesn't always result in wanted status. Sometimes they don't care at all, sometimes they put sirens on but don't do anything else, just stand there with sirens on and no wanted status. Pedestrians keep walking into walls and crossing the road back and forth for no reason. Npc and your car on auto-drive move very slowly, even if there's no one driving in front of you.I could go on and on about flaws of this game but it wasted enough of my time already. In many aspects, this game is much worse than WD2. I guess, it's one of those Ubisoft scenarios when studios take turns on making new entries for a certain franchise, and this time it was an incompetent studio's turn."

Now that I've seen it in action, I am quite disappointed.The enviroment is stunning. Futuristic european city mixing the old and brand new architecture looks breathtaking and I just love roaming these streets. But that's where Ubisoft excellance ends. Story is alright, but could use more drive. Game lets you decide some moral decisions yet they don't feel like it. Idea of recycling is good, but not in games. Visiting the same location for a fifth time is just no go.As for the play as anyone you wish, interesting concept, but not greatly excecuted and not really suitable for this. You can recruit people via one of 7 generic quests, which makes you drive all across London back and forth. You will use the metro system for this a lot, but you have to discover all those station first (like the devs never saw a map in metro). It doesn't feel like you can play anyone. You can play as someone acting like one of few written characters and sometimes it just feels weird. I also haven't seen a difference in recruiting with liberated borough, quests are the same. This system doesn't allow you to build anything towards the character, because you can just replace him like a pawn in a strategy game. This means cutscenes are more generic and less personal, previous titles have them done better. I'd say this was not so successful side step, but interesting experiment nontheless.Don't buy it for the full price, buy a Uplay+ for a month, it's enough time to play it once since you'll likely won't replay it again in the future."

Однако применение таковых элементов, подход к дизайну уровней и моделей, элементов геймплея и вообще атмосферы и окружения могут напрочь убивать погружение и удовольствие от игры. В силу вышеназванных плюсов игра играбельна, но только недолгое время или в мазохистских целях. Реплея и удовольствия ноль, игрок ощущает себя очень некомфортно в игровом мире, чувствует себя обманутым и даже спешащим по каким-то неведомым делам во время игры. Само собой, такая игра не представляет настоящей ценности. Она не дерьмо, а просто треш. А критерий оценок и всякие там критики, сейчас по другому работает, если ты будешь писать плохие обзоры то теряешь с большой долей вероятности лояльность студии, и прощай вечеринки, предрелизные копии игры, эксклюзивные интервью, закрытые показы и прочее, ну а если это крупная студия то фактически смерть твоей карьере и полетишь ты из редакции, только в путь.

Yes you can do a lot of similar missions and have fun every time but to a point. I didn't care for the story. A bad guy blows up parts of London and you hack your way into bringing back 'DedSec' into control of said areas. The game feels it's been quickly developed to have ANY piece of the GTA Online cake and the campaign is half-assed. Visually it is quite pretty but I had major performance issues with Raytracing enabled (even in its lowest setting) on my 2060 Super and continued playing with RTX off. Get it only on some major sale.

The ""play as anyone"" feature at first made it difficult to feel attached to any of your protagonists... simply because you have so many of them.  What I found that helped though was to think of the entire team as your protagonist, after doing this I found I could enjoy the story.  It would be nice to add features to help you feel more attached to individual characters though.  Watch Dogs has great potential, and I could see the ""play as anyone"" becoming fun with future polish."

627,BassoonBoi,"Dec 19, 2020",8,"Having played the previous two games I was interested to see how this game would set itself apart from the other installments, and I was pleasantly surprised. It handles differently from the previous two games, not just in advancements in the hacking mechanics but also in how levels are structured and how combat plays out.The game doesn't run amazingly on my rig. It's not revolutionary. The plot isn't memorable. But the game is fun, relatively bug-free (impressive for Ubisoft), and unique. Even though it could've been phenomenal with another year of development I am satisfied with the game I have."

629,Manos84,"Jan 24, 2021",6,"While the recruitment mechanic is a great idea, it falls flat on its face. Game developers cannot create a well rounded character or fully detailed character model for every possible recruit in the city, not even for the special operatives you will unlock when you liberate each borough. Therefore, as a player you cannot really connect with any of them. One special operative in particular is very poorly designed, with the way he looks and his profession, being very dissimilar with the way he speaks. Furthermore, after a few hours in the game you can start using only one operative, regardless of the mission, as you become ustoppable with all the tech you have unlocked.London is very well designed though and the story is quite good, however you can see all the plot twists coming from a mile away.Graphics are ok. I cannot see any major improvements over the last entry in the series, while Ray Tracing really doesn't bring anything visually groundbreaking in the visuals apart from tanking your frame rate.In general it is an OK game to spend some time on. Don't buy it full price though as it isn't worth it."

632,MineBorder,"Jun 27, 2021",7,"|7.4| Personally Thought this game had a better story than 2 but worse gameplay. I bought Ubisoft Plus for a month and thought it was a great deal to play games I heard bad reviews about. I liked the concept of this game when it first was announced. There were a lot of features shown during the announcement of this game and then it vanished off the earth for around 6 months. It got delayed multiple times and I was very excited about it when the release date was confirmed. I love the AC and the WD games. Some of my friends bought it on day one and told me it was not worth it, not giving it a decent chance. It took me 13 hours to complete the game and I actually enjoyed it, I just wish it was longer. There are some minor things about the game like its lack of mechanics, bugs, physics, and its very bad on great hardware. I have a 1070 and I had to, unfortunately, run the game on low settings to keep a steady 60 frames. I would say if you want to give this game a chance, buy it for $40 or lower and think of it as a sandbox game, instead of a story-driven game. There is still more to do after the 13 hours of story with side missions and getting new characters so I hope to play some more of this game before my Ubisoft Plus expires."

634,PaulGR,"May 16, 2021",8,"Kinda buggy but the latest update was amazing, allowing us to further customize Operatives in more depth. The recruit anyone is actually a pretty nice addition, however it is as swallow as you can imagine it would be. There are only like 3 voices for male and female making choices obsolete. The diversity comes down to clothing only and 1-2 minor ""skills"" that might be unique to some NPCs, pretty much meaning every NPC is a clone of another, just a different skin tone rotating between 3 different voices. Wide as the ocean, but deep as a puddle. Hopefully they will keep this formula but upgrade it for future titles. If you are gonna allow every NPC to be playable, you need more voices, more body builds (thin, muscular, fat etc), more hair, more perks and so on. Not a bad game overall, gameplay-wise is fun. Avoid Permadeath Mode since you will lose Operatives forever due to being killed by silly bugs."
635,dumle,"Jul 14, 2021",3,I got the game with my new 3080 graphics card which makes it more funny that i can barely run the thing. poorly optimized doesn't even begin to describe it.

636,inverguy,"Sep 16, 2021",1,"Purchased the game on sale and oh boy I'm happy it was a sale. This game is from the shelf called ""shallow as water in the toilet"". Graphically looks outstanding but anything from driving to moving across the city seems disjointed. The game looks like it was designed to support the whole political correctness that is going wild. In general no lethal weapons. If I were to score it in comparison to other Watchdogs games... this one would get 1/10. I'm giving it 4/10 just for graphic. AVOID. I purchased this due to discount and boredom... would be better off wiping my bum with the money I spent on this. Actually I give it 1/10... as it pains me that I wasted my money and time."
637,radixlecti84,"Feb 17, 2021",6,"Watch Dogs Legion makes an ambitious departure from it's old formula by introducing a new ""Play as anyone"" mechanic, this new addition allows you to play as one of dozens of the Jamaican or butch lady protagonists you can find on the street, if that's not to your liking you can play as an asian dude clearly voiced by a white irish guy. /s This new mechanic is a great idea that is poorly implemented, My first character was a suave looking black guy with a posh English accent, his personality oozed charisma and all credit goes to the voice actor, by my 6th mission however he was dead, and instead I found myself playing as a Jamaican guy as he was the only voice actor in my collection who wasn't irritating. This being a game set in london I was really looking forwards to playing as a relatable protagonist, I found one guy I sorta liked but he got killed in the next mission due to a bug, I ended up playing the rest of the game as a camp Gen Z bloke who was quirky enough but didn't really deliver much during the games climactic scenes. I think it would have been better if they hadn't made such broad strokes, focused on 12 or so characters and built them up more so that when you loose them you feel it. Sure you could say that more playable avatars leads to more variety but 95% of the operatives I encountered during my 30 hour playthrough were either Jamaican or Female, or like, just plain drab. London proved itself to be a great reproduction, the gameplay itself was solid and locations were well put together, there was a lot of effort put into some of these spots but quite often you'd be in and out in 3 minutes by dropping a spider drone from the sky exactly where you needed them to be. I felt a bit bad for the level designers! At the 30 hour mark the game was starting to outstay it's welcome, I definitely got my moneys worth and it was fun to play, there was just something about this game that didn't sell itself to me. Like, why was it that every British character spoke like ""Wa gwan rude boi, dat car is peng"" or just posh, where were the scousers, the mancs, the southerners, the brummies? London isn't only populated by Londoners and Jamaicans."
638,RavenZyT,"Jan  8, 2021",2,"I give it a 2 because the level design is amazing. It´s the only thing good in the videogame. The Ai one of the most stupid I've ever seen in videogames. And what to tell about driving cars and motorcycles. OMG! As in all Watch Dogs games, they continue having this driving that you suffer every time you get into a vehicle because you don´t know if you will survive the travel. The car destruction system is horrible, driving is horrible, trees, streetlights, and fences continue with the Watch Dogs 1 bug of falling in slices. You can fall from 5000 metres height and you won´t get damage, also if you get hit by a car no damage is applied to you or knockback. This is my review simply they continue without solving those problems that they have till the first game was released. The story is a bit poor with 3 villains that for me they are not as bad to be villains, the character system that you can recruit everyone makes it impossible to empathize with them because they die and they are gone forever and you simply take another agent and that's it."

643,ejizateam,"Aug 15, 2021",10,"[RUS]Итак, моё мнение! Я прошёл Watch Dogs: Legion на 100 процентов, кроме сбора всякого хлама. Зачистил все районы и тд и могу сказать что игра меня удивила в хорошем плане, не на что не надеялся, но понравилась она мне даже больше 2й части. К плюсам:Отличная графика, не сказать что революция, но ооочень приятная картинка, особенно ночью.Геймплей, мне понравилось, что теперь хакинг больше не ограничивают ботнет ресурсами, что делает сами взломы довольно веселыми, особенно если дело касается транспорта, жаль только, что убрали разведение мостов, а то хотелось бы посмотреть на то, как с Тауэрского моста падают десятки машин.Интересные и веселые миссии, игру прошел вместе с доп миссиями и они не разочаровали. Миссии районов только через чур короткие, но вот например миссия, где мы заходим в дом к Скай Ларсен или миссия района, где мы попадаем внутрь Биг-Бэна очень удивили.Система агентов, она очень крутая. Можно гулять по городу и случайно завербовать мужа одной из агентов, это же реально круто!Перейдём к нейтральной стороне:Сюжет, он очень пресный, сделан для галочки, но с другой стороны ждать сюжет от Watch Dogs это глупо. Мне лично очень сильно понравилась арка со Скай Ларсен и в частности персонаж Бэгли, есть что то в нём такое, что притягивает.Отрицательная сторона:Физика, физика здесь просто отвратная, машины не рулятся никак, они как будто специально настроены очень чувствительно, физика стрельбы так же не обрадовала, но и не разочаровала, отдача есть, хоть и сделана очень деревянно, но вес оружия вообще не ощущаешь.Итак, подведем итог, я обожаю эту игру, эти 30 часов что я наиграл я получал удовольствие, меня эта игра реально смогла развлечь и не наскучила даже после прохождения доп. миссий. Я ставлю этой игре 5 баллов, хоть и понятно что она не идеальна, но я не совсем понимаю отзывы критиков, по моему игра реально достойна внимания!"
644,HorridSalmon,"Mar  6, 2021",10,Watch Dogs: Legion is an absolutely amazing game and honestly my GOTY! The concept of being able to recruit anyone is just amazing and is delivered amazingly. People have been saying that this games voice acting and lip-sinking is horrible - THIS IS NOT TRUE! As a British citizen i can say that the voices are amazing and sometimes hilarious to hear! Lip-sinking is not a problem either! The map and London it's self is **** stunning and beautiful and Ubisoft have done an amazing job at making London look dystopian and beautiful at the same time! The story is amazing and see's you get really attached to your AI companion Bags aka/Bagley. In conclusion i love this game and just don't understand why its getting so much hate. I understand that there's been no DLC up to yet but i think this is because Ubisoft are focusing on releasing the multiplayer and i think as soon as we see that come out the sooner we will see the DLC come out as well.

654,MrGreyGuy,"Apr  2, 2021",4,"So, I played this game for 24h now...I must say, that im largely disappointed. I was excited at first, enjoyed it for the first few hours but at the end - already in the middle of it - it just repeated itself over and over again.Including this, there are also those bugs... Like, Ubisoft took another year to release this, and still this is happening? The npcs are not capable of functioning together with the traffic. They jump randomly onto the streets and the game mechanics are also not that satisfying at all.The story in this game is also very, very unsatisfying. I dont want to spoil here, but... the stereotypes in this story - atleast thats how I see it - are really hitting hard.So... about the world itself. The design of it is pretty decent, London looks great... BUT, its basically an empty city. The full potential of this map isnt used. Another thing disturbing me is this ""cybepunky"" like design flaw they choose. Everywhere - and when I say everywhere I mean everyhere - you see some shiny blinky led. The whole city basically is a giant rgb- gaming pc. This could've been handled better... less exaggerated.Now about the missions...You can free boroughs, you can recruit characters - which is not really necessary at all, cause you can basically do everything with one character - and of course there are the main missions.I dont want to talk about those, I want to talk about the secondary missions...I mean, they are cringy. Everytime you free a borough there is this random firework, with people shouting ""ded sec go"" or something similar like that. I get the idea behind it, but I can fairly say that this is repeating history. When I free a borugh, I want to have the feeling that theres some sort of tension getting created by us (dedsec), and I dont just want to have firework representing that everything is going to be fine, or that we are in control now - atleast partly. The game just feels... I wouldnt say incomplete, but it feels like something is missing.I get, when you say it is a good game... but my personal opinion is, that this game is not worth the money you paid for. Also, just a side note... the most awesome thing I experienced during this game, was a motorbike driving around circles and hitting humans until they are knocked out. Sincerely,Your MrGreyGuy"
655,WaterDoggo,"May  1, 2021",7,"I spent 71 hours in this game and im ready to write a review about this game. Campaign: Its great. I had lots of fun with it but you cant replay any mission which kinda sucks because you can approach those missions in many ways. After you complete main storyline this game becomes a shell of itself. There is literally nothing to do except for recruiting people. Online: Its literally Watch Dogs Legion but with grind and several new bugs. Here Operatives got kinda ruined, they don't have any relatives and if you beat the living crap out of them they can still join you. They literally turn into Pokemon's waiting to be used.

661,namfa2002,"Jan 13, 2021",5,"After completing the whole game in 25+ hours, I have to complain that the story and content of the whole game are too short. Comparing to other open-world games from Ubisoft, this game sells at the same price range but does not offer the same amount of content. However, the recruiting system is still inspiring and special, which could offer a sense of freedom and possibility in this Open world game."
662,TovaNeEZaeto,"Feb 13, 2021",3,"I have to admit, the game is fun. My main issue with it is the random crashes and especially the lauch error I had at first. I don't need to mentione the lack of help from Ubisoft. They were quick to respond, but every time I contacted them I always got the same ""solutions"", no matter I have tried everything they wrote in their troubleshoot. In the end it turned out to be a missing dll file (vcruntime140_1.dll) to be precise. So in case anyone is having issue launching the game at start you could try finding this file somewhere and put it in your system32 folder. It worked for me and for many others.As for the game I am having fun playing it. The fight mechanics are fun, engaging, although it can get a bit repetetive. Missions are also fun, sometimes a bit repetitive, but still fun. Playing with gadges around, you don't even have to physically enter a restricted area most of the times to complete objectives, your gadgets can do the job. You can pretty much recruit every NPC you find on the street and play with him/her. Just mind you that you have a limit of how many people you can recruit. You can always retire a character from you crew and recruit another.Overall, the game is fun, but random crashes could occur. And don't waste your time contacting Ubisoft support. They are kind and try to help, but their solutions are pretty much useless, sorry to say that, but that's the truth, and in the end they abandon your case as they consider it as ""resolved""."
663,WDforever,"Feb 12, 2021",10,"Would very much recommend! It had some fps issues when it launched, but they have updated it so much since then. Online is coming out soon, dlc's as well."
664,BuBBleGUm1000,"Feb 12, 2021",10,"What a great game! London is so well re-created, there's so much fun things to do in this game. Hacking is better than ever. Flying on drones makes it even better, because you can go on top of almost any building and just chill around there and look at this incredible scenery. Only negative would be lack of central main character, but this will likely be fixed by DLC where Aiden (main character of Watch Dogs 1) makes return."
665,preter,"Mar 28, 2021",1,"Features a partial aesthetic resembling that of a cyberpunk fiction, all without the narrative depth that would bring it to life. A nauseatingly corporate produced copy and paste open world, with absolutely no inspiration in sight. You really can't make any NPC picked off the street into a compelling protagonist."
666,NoxSkia,"Mar 21, 2021",3,"Terrible PC optimization, no cockpit view while driving. Watch Dogs 2 is still the best one. Ubisoft doesn't let you refund after launching the game once, so better pirate the game first to see if it can run well on your PC before buying."
667,RaydeBrigade,"Sep 23, 2021",6,"Watch Dogs: Legion is a decent game that attempts to pull off something unique and creative, and succeeds for the most part. Despite this, however, the game is severely lacking in many other areas, notably in it's writing and open world, in addition to having FAR too many collectibles. Get it on sale."
668,slat3r,"Apr 27, 2021",9,"As my first Watchdogs game, it was amazing. The story, the mechanics, the immersion.Graphics were amazing in some areas but looked like a ps3 game in others. I'm not one to care for graphics so long as it keeps me immersed so I had no problems with that. The game has little to no replay value and some mechanics are overpowered and not fully thought through. Now playing the first game in the Watchdogs series, I can understand where the disgust is coming from. It is a step down from the other two games in the series but I would rather treat it as its own game. Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely."
669,KAS_113,"Oct 13, 2021",0,"It's not on Steam, so I'm giving 0. I'm not buying it from some trash epic game store. And stop making some kind of MMO-RPG out of your games"

671,whitelivesmtter,"Jul  2, 2021",10,"Have to say it's weaker than watch dogs 1 (best in the series) but even then it's not worst game ever. I have high hopes for Aiden's dlc, hopefully Ubisoft delivers.actual score 6/10but thanks to haters i have to give it 10/10"
672,HoundFromHell,"Sep 21, 2021",3,"Can't really give this game any credit. thought it was gonna be a decent game, but ubisoft always know how to mess things up. i mean this game was pushed back and everything. and this is the state it comes out in laughable.1) graphics are horrible. so cartoon that i was waiting for bugs bunny, daffy duck, tweety bird to come appear.2) the handling is a nightmare. so loose i felt like i was playing a game from the first PlayStation. its 2021 an this is how they are still make their controls.3) the story line is boring an pathetic. i hated every second of it. no creative thinking nothing."
673,lnx00,"Aug  7, 2021",0,"After playing and loving the previous Watch Dogs games, this on is a huge disappointment and doesn't even deserve to be part of the Watch Dogs series.It hat terrible Gameplay, Optimization, Story, Graphics and boring. I couldn't even bring myself to play it for more than 3 hours."
674,cynesige,"Aug 25, 2021",4,I used to love this game until the most recent update came out. With the release of TU 5.5 came a quest titled The New Creed. Part of the quest has you jumping from platform to platform. The problem is there is no jump button in the game.
675,Reviewsofshed18,"Aug 27, 2021",4,"Aside from this being one of the most rushed, glitchiest, careless, cringiest and repetitive games I've ever played, it crashes within 10 minutes every time I launch on my decent PC. Should have refunded it when it crashed 4 times on the first mission, but then it settled down for a while; giving me chance to play this joke of a game. The ""play as anyone idea"" was bold from Ubisoft, good to see them being adventurous for once; but I'd still rather play as one cool solo protagonist like Aiden Peirce. (It also limits the story) Overall, just don't buy..."
676,Woolee,"Sep 29, 2021",7,"Idk why anyone would hate it, it's not earth-shattering, but it's nonetheless very cool open world hacking game. I mean i would understand someone giving it 6 or 7 for technical problems, but fla"
677,frxstbtw,"Sep 30, 2021",1,"this game cannot compare to the original watch dogs, even watch dogs 2. Graphics are amazing il give the game that. But the storyline is ass. Has nothing good really going for it and honestly i didnt find it fun at all. I was looking forward to the game and got let down by it. In the original watch dogs, there was a deep dark story about aiden pearce, and nothing will compare to that. It seems they didnt improve from the last game, the overall character connection with the player is awful. Its just gone down a road where watch dogs 2 went down, no character connection with yourself, with watch dogs 1 i felt close with aiden and felt emotion for the game, these games just dont hit it."
678,K_True10,"Oct 17, 2021",8,"Sehr gutes Spiel für Ubisoft-Verhältnisse... Bietet Langzeitmotivation, ist interessant gestaltet, London ist sehr gut getroffen und die Welt wirkt auch ziemlich lebendig. KI ist im Kampf zwar nicht sehr intelligent, aber für die Story und die eigene kleine Revolution ist das Game völlig in Ordnung"
