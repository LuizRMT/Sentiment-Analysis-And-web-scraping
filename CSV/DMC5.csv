1,MAX4D,"Nov 16, 2020",10,Capcom really knows what it's doing. We still see the brilliance of this great work
2,quedornoscolhoe,"Jan 23, 2021",10,"This game is certainly one of the best modern videogames. It surpassed DMC4 and 3. Intriging gameplay (every playable has its own style) incredible music, beautiful stage and character design, humorous as always! If you are looking for a good action game, oh boy.... Buy this one!"
3,makkusu1,"Nov 14, 2020",10,New graphics for a best slasher of third-person - Devil May Cry 5 !:))))))))
4,GauV70,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"The final boss fight alone worth all your money. Just buy DMC 5 special edition. vergil is so satisfying to play and his movesets are just amazing. Do not rush in this game take your time leaning all the movesets, practice properly in the void and you will have a great time. DMC 5 SE is 1010"
5,Amuri_z,"Nov 17, 2020",10,"This is the best action game,and gameplay  of all time.!!! No one can deny that.!"
6,schwa3,"Nov 16, 2020",10,I paid 600$ to play as 1 character 1 month early in a game I've already put 200 hours into and I regret nothing. The game of the generation.
7,Thejontxu,"Nov 15, 2020",9,"Juegaso, ahora incluso mejor y con graficazos next gen y con mas contenido, mas todo el contenido de la deluxe edition perfecta esta edicion."
8,Bryce052,"Dec  9, 2020",10,"Great experience with this game! Fun gameplay, excellent enemy variation and boss battles. About 12-15 hours of gameplay here with the main story with replay value in additional content and modes. The cutscenes and writing in this game are another +. Would recommend picking up this game!"
9,Juancho03,"Feb 15, 2021",10,A decir verdad se siente corto de contenido a comparación de la pasada edición especial pero tiene cosas que la compensan pero no en gran medida aun así no vale mucho la pena para quienes tienen la versión de anterior generación pero para quienes no lo han probado es una excelente opció

15,mostlikelyluigi,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"Amazing, and graphically stunning running on a smooth 120fps on the incredible PS5."
16,willerkiller,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"This game is the main reason that I got a PS5! What we have here is the absolute pinnacle of the Hack and Slash genre. Vergil feels perfect to play, the game looks amazing and it basically has endless replayability due to its exquisite core combat and abundance of modes. If you want to experience what a true hardcore Action game at blistering speed is like, then getting this masterpiece is an absolute must! THANK YOU CAPCOM!"
17,Fehprates,"Nov 13, 2020",10,Vergil is aaaawesoooome!!! I **** love this game!!! Waiting for the dmc 6!!!
18,robber_soul,"Nov 28, 2020",10,"DMC 5:SE perfects an already virtually perfect game even further. The increased graphics, performance, and loading smooths out the rough edges of the last-gen experience, while the addition of Vergil adds 100s more hours of deep and engaging combat mechanics. Absolute must-buy for action game fans who own a PS5."
19,Darkslayer_,"Nov 18, 2020",10,The ultimate DMC experience. The RE engine looks amazing with next gen consoles the game feels smooth at high resolution.
20,DanteRedgrave,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Vale la pena volver a jugar...!!Por supuesto que si¡¡La razón: Gráficos mas increíbles. vergil, contenido extra, vergil...Ya dije vergil"
21,RidzDile,"Dec  1, 2020",10,greatest hack n slash game ever this game deserve to be a nominee for the goty !!!
22,OwtDaft,"Jan 18, 2021",7,"+ Story is pretty good though takes a while to really get going. Some funny moments in there.+ The cut scenes are very well animated and look great.+ Music for the most part is good as you would expect.+ Combat when not playing as V is very good.- The ray tracing sucks. You can have it with a unstable 30 fps or just 1080p. I switched it to off.- The entire second half of the game has really dull copy paste environments to go though.- V is a terrible character to play as and the game switches the character you control way too often.- There luckily isn't a lot of platforming in the game but when there is, it's very bad.- The game can be a bit too silly at times.= I found my self mostly liking the game for the story and though the combat is good, it's hard to get too into with the constant character switching. I have to be honest, but I enjoyed the Reboot more."
23,njp500,"Nov 20, 2020",0,"I am old enough to remember when DMC, the original Devil May Cry, dropped on PS2 20 years ago.  What a game!  It changed everything and was completely perfect.  I, and many people I knew, played that game extensively in absolute awe of what had been created by Capcom.   A masterpiece of art and triumph of the medium, if that's not too much to say about a video game and I don't think it is.  DMC5 tarnished that legacy when it came out, pay 2 win garbage.   Capcom sacrificed one of their most regarded assets for a quick cold cash grab.  They ongoingly turn around and betrayed the industry and people that loved them by advancing the most greedy, dishonest, and repugnant practices in the form of microtransactions and p2w.   I couldn't even play DMC5 without frustration and I wanted to because allegedly there is a good game there, nor did I recognize it from it's lofty origins.  Don't let anybody tell you that games aren't getting worse, you're just getting older.  That's nonsense.  Games are getting worse.  Pop in the original DMC and it plays just as great as it did back then.  I recognize and appreciate a good game when it comes along today just as much if not more as I did back then too. Games just aren't made with the same enthusiastic, passionate, creative, original love of the genre they were before.  I hope they are again. An aside, one thing I don't get is why they do these goofy nonsensical practices that drive people away.  If they're hurting so bad, why don't they just charge more for the game and produce a good one.  I paid 60$ (if not in real dollars, then the equivalent through inflation) for the original DMC 20 years ago.  No dlc.  No 50GB ""updates"".  No multiplayer.  And I would happily pay more than that for every perfect high quality game that came down the line, hell I bought GOW new twice."
24,NeedleNose1,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"The greatest action game ever made. Fun characters, beautiful graphics, incredible soundtrack, and -most importantly- perfect gameplay."
25,conf1911,"Dec 16, 2020",0,"The reason I gave zero is not related to the game itself. It's because the ""special edition"" is only available for FULL PRICE to people who already had paid for the game. I had just bought the game for the PS4, bought the PS5 and soon after that the game was released in its ""special edition"", which is basically the exactly same game but enhanced for the PS5. The obvious thing to do (if not to patch the game for free as other developers have done) was to offer the option to people that had bought the ps4 version to pay extra only for the upgrade. There should be one full version of the ""special edition"" to people who did not have the game, and another, much cheaper, ""patch"", to people who had already bought the game. But no, there is no such option. The developers are making people who had just bought the game to pay FULL PRICE for the SAME GAME, only patched to take advantage of the ps5 hardware. THIS IS BULL****. CAPCOM is just trying to make UNJUST profit here, the ""special edition"" should never be bought for FULL PRICE by people who already had paid for the game."
26,frederik1478,"Jun 24, 2021",10,"Still one of the best action games of all time all characters are fun to use and play an end epic ending to the franchise, an amazing game and now it run perfectly on PS5 so there's no excuse to not play it"
27,Siome,"Jan 16, 2021",6,Disappointed by this special edition which bring nothing compared tos tandard version. Even Virgil story is just the same as original game. Nothing really much except the upscale of PS4 version
28,srinu634,"Mar 11, 2021",9,"This game is a straight 9.5! Too bad I can't rate 9.5 in Metacritic. Pro's:- Playing as Vergil is soul satisfying.- Playing as Dante is soul satisfying too.- Vergil and Dante made me feel like this is one of the best rpg game I ever played.- The level design is amazing.- PS5 Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for Nero are fun to play and well implemented- 120 fps mode. Of course!- Final battle is so good. It increases the adrenaline rush a lot. A lot. Cons:- The fire animation is so childish. I laughed the first time I saw that.- I noticed frame rate drops during intense battles. Jitters that I haven't felt in a long time.- Combat is fun but it can get a little overwhelming with each player having their own combinations. Apart from the above points, this is truly one of the best rpg game I ever played."
29,DSouls_guy,"Feb  9, 2021",9,"Devil may cry 5, looks and plays great, I played most of the dmc games. to date dmc5 is the best in the series, Capcom is shining with content."
30,xxAcesHighxx,"Aug 29, 2021",8,"A great port of an already great game. The faster loading times are a huge boon, as is the improved resolution. Despite the often cheesy one liners, this is an easy recommendation for fans of character action game. It’s priced right, too."
31,scorp332211,"Mar 21, 2021",7,This is a high action game. I’m not the biggest hack & slash fan so this isn’t my favorite type of game. I found the beginning to be fun and exciting. However it quickly gets very repetitive. Basically go through either a crumbling city or the depths of Hell settings. The enemies are not varied with only about 4-5 different typical enemy types. Bosses are a bit better. This isn’t a difficult game as I don’t think I died once. Overall I wasn’t that impressed with it except the music is really good. I wouldn’t really recommend. I’m selling my copy.
32,MadBert91,"Mar  5, 2021",8,"Me ha gustado mucho el juego, si bien podía haber sido más larga la historia, los combos son algo difíciles de hacer pero eso es algo normal en estos juegos, la falta de doblaje al castellano a mi parecer le resta un puntito."
33,xiekaidream,"Sep 17, 2021",8,几乎没有玩过ACT，尝试了一下=。= 连招什么的是不存在的，和玩大乱斗卡比无限下B一样，一旦会了一招就用个不停~ 果然还是但丁比较爽~ 剧情什么的太虎头蛇尾了吧，有点燃不起来，难道是因为玩了human模式-。- 不过，Nico赛高！
34,Daniel0809,"Feb  7, 2021",8,"Im replaying DMC 5 on the ps5 and its much better graphics and frame rate. I love these games and playing as vergil through the game is a plus, the game is on sale used at games & Id recommend picking up a copy if u haven't yet"
35,saxdude1,"Jun 24, 2021",9,"For fans of Devil May Cry, this is the game we have been waiting for since 2008. Dante and Nero are back in their full glory, with the combat set to perfection with one of the most addictive and satisfying combat loops I have experienced in a long time. And if you are playing on console, Special Edition is the way to go, though you're not left out if you don't have access to the new hardware. My biggest criticism is the way mission scoring works, but it's not the worst thing and it does not take away too much from the strengths of the game."
36,Vlad101,"Dec 23, 2020",10,"Лучший слешар, но теперь с Вергилием и его комбами и глубиной, новым боссом, парой катсцен и фишек нового поколения консолей.Очевидный вин."
37,cloud578,"Jun 11, 2021",10,"Big DMC fan here.Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a **** rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success.Addition of Vergil gives a fresh feel to the game.But i was expecting Vergil to be playable in the main story."
38,Svetlendrius,"Mar  2, 2021",8,"A varied soundtrack for each character, excellent graphics, multiple techniques and combinations, a worthy plot.  Not the best bosses and mob designs, the soundtrack is not bad, but something is missing in it.  The start of the game sags a bit and also lacks puzzles.  The game breathes with the spirit of the elderly Dante, but still it is not bad."
39,Evelyn_Schwab,"Dec  3, 2020",8,"Hard to be unbiased on this one. I love Devil May Cry, I love Virgil and i loved the original DMCV. That game was a 10/10 for me, but this one is hard to be all positive about.Virgil plays beautifully and is a perfect edition to the roster, no complaints. However, for a $70 AUD price tag, it would have been nice to see more. Virgil, as a DLC, costs only $7 for PC and last gen. The other upgrades, Ray tracing and Legendary Dark Knight more, feel tacked on and underdeveloped. Turbo mode works great, but I'm in the camp that feel it could have been done from the get-go. What make it more frustrating, is that both Turbo Mode and LDK are available on PC as free mods.Rating of 8 comes from the outstanding quality of the original game and the excellent work on Virgil, but there isn't anything here to justify upgrading from the original version once the Virgil DLC comes out."
40,Rino1z,"Jun 22, 2021",10,Devil may cry 5 is the best action game ever.............................................................
41,Raios-Rogue,"Jan 31, 2021",10,"My top 5 favorite game of the century. The best action game ever created the best DMC game ever created yes even better than DMC 3 SE Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition is better than the original DMC 5, thanks to the many additions like playable Vergil, Turbo Mode and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. ray tracing and DualSense support are massive game-changers they add so much to the atmosphere the gameplay the lighting combat visuals and the art of the game, they round up the package nicely and help making more than a worthy purchase for every Devil May Cry fan doesn't matter if your an oldschool fan or a casual walking in for the first time you gonna have a great time the game has a plot movie you can watch that explains what happened in the story in the past 4 games the art in this game is amazing the devil triggers are the best ever made the game has plenty of replayability with bloody palace and more difficulties this game on dante must die and Hell and Hell difficulty is the hardest DMC game out of all DMC games but thankfully you have the void to practice as much as you want and learn the enemy moveset and practice your stylish combos and for those who did not have yet the pleasure to experience the best character Vergil in action games this is your chance to jump and experience a phenomenal development of characters this game has the best music every character is unique funny cocky bad ass and has his own personality and his moveset and the combat is the best ever made in any game period on par with the combat god of war 4 2018 the bosses are unique this game has the best boss designs ever created and are most memorable the only problem with this game is the lock on system Director Hideaki Itsuno never learned his lesson from seeing Director Hideki Kamiya's Devil May Cry 1 which had the worst camera in any game the DMC 5 camera is improved so much from DMC 1 but the camera lock on is still an issue if there is a DMC 6 which i am hoping for one of the focuses must be on creating a better camera system the lock in DMC 5 is bad it locks on to the target you don't want it to lock on the game kinda has a soft lock on which always targets the wrong target and Legendayr dark knight diffuclty that becomes a real problem since so many enemies are on the screen you just have to play without locking on if you haven't played this game PS5 is the best way to experience the best action DMC game ever made Let's Rock Baby."
42,djdizzy,"Mar 18, 2021",9,"I’ve been playing some 10/10 games lately, some tough acts to follow.  But I gotta say, with DMC5 SE I’ve had some of the most fun moments I’ve had playing a game in a very long time.I play it with ray-tracing off and high frame-rate mode on.  For a game like this, you really feel the significant difference in gameplay.  The ray-tracing with high frame-rate off is cool for novelty, I’d suggest you give it a try.  But when it comes time to really get into the gameplay, turn off ray-tracing and focus on the high frame-rate for sure.It’s not a perfect 10/10 but this is the pinnacle of hack & slash.  Over-the-top action, extremely flashy & stylish, enjoyable story + cutscenes, lots of personality.  To put it simply, this game is a good time.  It’s like choosing to watch Action Jackson instead of The Green Mile.  Capcom is back in their prime."
43,Jorgenn,"Dec  6, 2020",8,"Finished it just to get the most out of my investment , but unlike 3 and 4 , i cant get myself to replay it , and the story was far from fun i just let the cutscenes go by without care"
44,datguytoxic,"Jul 15, 2021",9,I just wanna **** Lady’s warm and wet ****. Didn’t like the controls though
45,enes388huzeyfe,"Jan 22, 2021",8,tamam yeni gelen karakter güzel ancak oyun aynı oyun yani oynayan kişinin tekrar oynamasına değmez mesela diyelim ki sen hiçbirşekilde DMC5 oynmadın işte o zaman çok iyi
46,IviAless,"Jan 29, 2021",8,"This is definetly a good comeback.This is actually a pretty good Devil May Cry!Gameplay is awesome, graphics are astonishing and the music is great!The only bad thing... is the whole plot. It feels really forced from the start, and it has too much fanservice. Overall, this game rocks!"
47,Soupplate,"Mar 18, 2021",7,"The lore/story/thematic integration of the dmc series hady never particularly interested me, and it's the same case here. However, the action gameplay itself is some of the best in the general. Unfortunately, the gameplay experience is marred by uninteresting ""puzzles"" and platforming in-between enemy encounters. Still, a high water mark for modern action gameplay"
48,Kratos4Pac,"May 24, 2021",0,Das bisher schlechteste Dmc. War mal ein Riesen Fan aber das ist so zusammengeschustert da verstehe ich die ganzen positiven Wertungen der Presse nicht
49,Ironvikki,"Jun 29, 2021",9,I like this I play three time I like Dante dance
