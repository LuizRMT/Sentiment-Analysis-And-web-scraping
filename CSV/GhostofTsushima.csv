1,jilval678,"Aug 21, 2021",0,"I wish it was a Remastered version. So at least there was a better graphic for it. maybe even better Artificial intelligence and less bugs. But this ""Director's cut"" doesn't worth to re buy. The Iki Island is Okay . But just if you're upgrading the game. Not for full price."
2,leandroxk,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Wonderful game, expansion and dualsense features are great!it was great to revisit the game with these new features"
3,Sandeeps009,"Aug 21, 2021",10,This is the best way to play the game absolutely loving iki island and the added features and graphical improvements along with the Japanese lip sync make this game totally worth it
4,Hypershotz,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Directors Cut is the best version of the game and well worth the asking price, iki island is as stunning as the base game! New discoveries, New tales and challenges. Suckerpunch done an amazing job with this game and gonna get even better once rival's releases 10/10"
5,sergiopunky27,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Metacritic, you guys need to have a regulation with the review bombing, this is ridiculous"
6,DinaSousa,"Aug 21, 2021",10,I can't believe how content they is for $20.00. This game is totally worth every penny.
7,Soco9135,"Aug 21, 2021",0,"Really guys, nothing new to this game? You selll as GOT as a new game for 70 USD and bring things like lypsync who nobody cares about with almost none graphical improvements? Give me a break"
8,lDlMethoDl,"Aug 22, 2021",3,Don't see any expressive improviment that justified the expensive cost. Own the game por ps4 and to play it on ps5 have to pratically buy it again.
9,MetaPlayer6969,"Aug 21, 2021",10,This is true next gen version 4K native at 60fps with 3D audio and DualSense support !The DLC is giving you 17hours of fresh New contentGhost of Tsushima get awesome direction artistic ! It's a must play
10,ArnavPs,"Aug 21, 2021",10,Don't listen to all these negative reviews here they're just xbox fanboys who can't play the game....some of them are so damn stupid
11,Stefanobed,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Another masterpiece exclusive sony, amazing journey in feudal japan, great gameplay amazing graphics, PlayStation n1"
12,TheReal_Truth_,"Aug 22, 2021",0,Weak dlc and super over priced. It looks exactly the same as PS4 version and this game was never anything special anyway.
13,The_reason,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Boring, empty game. Graphics look outdated even for 2020. Not recommending this at full price."
14,iZac,"Aug 22, 2021",0,excellent $10 from the airvery bad impact on the game industry by increasing the price tag just because you have a new console
15,Liabad425,"Aug 21, 2021",0,the same game somehow getting better metascore by critics ??? nothing is improved ( except for lip sync) every other issues are still there. then how they giving it higher score?? Don't buy it. it's the same game as before
16,Salvadorenorico,"Aug 21, 2021",0,"More of the same, more of the same , more of the same, really... why no focus on gameplay and a bigger territory? I paid 70 USD for an already old game and iki island brings nothing to the table."
17,Justreviews,"Aug 22, 2021",0,I didn't like this game at all. PS4 and PS5 have so much better video games. Not recommending.
18,Kerber,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"So I bought this game for ps4 for 70$ 11 months ago and now to upgrade it to ps5 version I had to pay 30$. This is Sony’s version of Smart Delivery, smart for company, not much for its fans. But hey, This Is For Payers, and now I ended with 100$ game. For additional  30$ I got DLC that is rather short and graphic upgrade is not that visible. Well, this was such unpleasant experience for me that I don’t recommend. There are plenty other games that give upgrades for free and console manufacturers that dont try to squeeze last dime from their fans. My mistake for wasting money on this but try not to repeat it."
19,ivancloud,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Same Game, less graphics detail, poor content = 80€. This is the greatness of Playstation."
20,yuricloud3,"Aug 22, 2021",4,Falta de carater cobrar 59 reais por uma sincronia labial e remover a antiga da loja. Ta de foder em sony
21,StreetLightss,"Aug 22, 2021",0,Game full of generic quests that are weaker version of Assassin's Creed quests. Hard pass.
22,TheTruthHurts17,"Aug 22, 2021",0,Just horrible how the new ps5 version turns out to be a downgrade from ps4.
23,khalid6m,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"I didn't expect it to be like that The story modeIt was not long and I did not notice any changes in the graphics, however the upgrade is paid I think it was a disappointment for those who bought this add-on"
24,Justicegaming,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Skip this. Pretty bad game that has awful camera angle. They should put character into center of screen. Also, it's super over priced."
25,whatajoke,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Let's be real here, only reason this game got any attention was because last of us 2 was so bad and people wanted to pretend that this game is super good. Actually they are both generic games. Yes it is better than last of us 2, but in general this game is absolutely nothing special. Not recommending, specially without no free upgrade."
26,Jinxthegame,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Overall pretty overrated and bad game, i'm very disappointed that i wasted money on it. Don't make my mistake."
27,thexilhs,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Literally nobody plays this game anymore, this game died out before 2020 ended. Main reason it was hyped up was because last of us part II had to fail in sales compared to this one. Nobody actually cared about this game. I personally don't like it all, generic rpg."
28,bringthenews,"Aug 22, 2021",0,Here's bunch of fake 10/10 reviews who are trying to pretend that this game is good. But thankfully most people already know what fail and rip off this game really is. What a terrible shame. If i could i would give this game -1 stars. Just plain awful. I hate this game so much.
29,Reddeadmm,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"It is madness that the PS5 upgrade is locked behind a double paywall. First, you have to buy the DLC, and then you have to buy the upgrade. That’s beside the fact that the upgrade almost does not improve anything in the game. Sony is losing customers and causing bad PR by trying to squeeze all the cash out of people who like Sony games."
30,vitor_1707,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"A atualização de forma alguma justifica o valor cobrado, chega a ser vergonhoso pagar 159 reais nisso. Aliás, a sony precisa rever a política de preços da PSN urgente no Brasil. Está ficando impossível comprar seus jogos."
31,CoolGaming,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"This ""expansion"" is absolute rip-off. Way overpriced and game itself is generic at best. Disregard all 10/10 Scorers."
32,EugeniuML,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Я могу понять почему DLC стоит денег. Я могу понять почему обновление для PS5 стоит денег. Но я искренне не понимаю почему я, покупая игру на старте за 4500 рублей, должен сейчас за обновление для PS5 доплачивать 2150 рублей, когда те кто не покупали игру вообще, могут купить всё сразу за 5500 рублей. Выходит что за то что я подержал игру на старте должен платить сейчас просто так на 1150 рублей дороже! Я не буду поддерживать такое отношения к игрокам!"
33,Brigade227,"Aug 22, 2021",3,Ghost was an already amazing looking game. I guess I kinda hoped for more with the directors cut. But in reality it’s just that—-a directors cut. Some extra content that was already on the PS4 disk. You can Sony is pushing their developers like Sucker Punch and Insomniac Games to rush new content to the shelves. I’d wait for this to go on sale.
34,Jack85,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Predictable and boring story, annoying quests and overall empty feel of the world make this one of weakest games i have played in very long time."
35,HAMODY99,"Aug 22, 2021",0,Why 70$ for ps4 game And why 30$ for only 9h little content You must give us free upgrade because we already paid for your PS5
36,ashutoshnegi,"Aug 22, 2021",0,is this event worth it when the upgrade is almost as expensive as getting kena bridge of spirits which looks goods in CGI trailers. sorry this aint worth your $
37,Asmar443,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"The same game, worse visuals, Price is a joke. I absolutely feel being robbed by SONY, Its the same game with higher price"
38,somegoodstuff,"Aug 22, 2021",0,This game is just lazy Assassin's Creed rip-off that got popular only thanks to last of us 2 hate.
39,FrostyFeet97,"Aug 22, 2021",1,"The same game, worse visuals, Price is a joke. I absolutely feel being robbed by SONY,  Its the same game with higher price"
40,aaronjf94,"Aug 21, 2021",0,They did almost nothing to upgrade it! It also in some ways actually looks worse than the ps4 pro version! This to me is theft! They won't refund me for the directors cut!!!
41,SOLIDIFIEDSNAKE,"Aug 22, 2021",1,"GoT was one of the best games released last year and I absolutely loved it. I was excited for Director's cut when it got announced. The upgrade path is so ridiculous and people are rightfully angry about it. Iki island expansion is still great and there is some good content here. APart from some minor crashes it's totally worth $20. What's bad is the extra $10 you have to pay just to unlock basic PS5 features which are promised for all PS5 games. I have no objections to pay for next gen enhancements when they are done right. Metro exodus, Miles Morales, FF7R, Star wars Jedi Fallen Order, Doom Eternal, A Plague's Tale and lot other games got next gen enhancements which significantly improved visual quality using next gen lighting, shadows etc, supporting Dualsense features and these are all given for free. Though GoT on PS4 looks great, I hoped for some changes in lighting, textures, shadows and draw distance as it's not a free next gen upgrade. Turns out it's just a mere resolution bump and slightly reduced load times. Such a dishonorable move that totally does injustice to this great game and Suckerpunch/Sony deserve these user scores."
42,loganzet,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Que pedazo de porquería, se ve mejor en la PS4 pro que en la ps5 encima lo dan a precio de nuevo, no lo compren mejor guarden su dinero"
43,HeisenbergIND21,"Aug 21, 2021",3,"A player who spent $70 on launch would have paid $100 in total to get the PS5 edition of the DC! Instead of giving a Game Pass like service, Sony and PS are rather busy duping it's own consumer base."
44,Ossesque,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"If I want nothing but better graphics on ps5 and the only version I've tried is the original ps4 version, I have to pay 30 USD. Even if I'm not interested in the new island."
45,D4vid,"Aug 21, 2021",0,"Same game sold two different times in a 12 month span. Ridiculous.I hope this trend of remaking/remastering games stops, especially when it comes to games that already were top notch in terms of graphics and hardware usage.This game is basically a joke."
46,Alonsox123,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"It is annoying that they charged 30 USD for this expansion considering how old is it, they recycled this to charge us full price for it with a 5 hour DLC and there are tecnically no graphical imporvements."
47,TheoreticalHero,"Aug 21, 2021",0,"No vale el precio, cuando la competencia te da las mejoras gratis. SONY te cobra por ellas y todos los fanboys ridículos le hacen una doguesa a Sony y le aplauden. Hay que dejar normalizar las malas prácticas en la industria, esta es la situación con este juego un DLC corto muy corto a 20 dolares y una actualización que debería de ser gratuita no valen el precios, piensa en tú bolsillo NO en el de las corporaciones"
48,MakgSnake,"Aug 21, 2021",1,Just wanted to play this game with all the PS5 features but you can’t as the update is locked behind a paywall. PlayStation is really screwing with their fans and sad part is the ponies are actually celebrating this horrible practice. Director’s Cut is nothing but a money grab. UPDATES should be free.

54,Inuyasha1,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"고스트 오브 쓰시마도 물론 세키로와 함께 근접 타격감에 있어선 최강이라 호평받는 갓겜이었지만, 이번 고스트 오브 쓰시마 디렉터즈 컷은 근접 타격감은 물론 그래픽이 훨씬 더 진일보한 초갓겜이 된듯함. 적군들의 Ai 인공지능도 수준급으로 높아지고, 게다가 세키로, 다크소울3 같은 소울류, 블레이드앤소울처럼 적군들도 강해져서 난이도도 어려워졌음. 특히 주술사는 특유의 버프 공격 때문에 순간적으로 적군들을 모든 공격을 무효화시키는 광전사로 강화시켜서 대적하기가 까다로운 적 중 하나. 이번 이키 섬은 쓰시마 섬보다 규모는 작지만 훨씬 짜임새 있고 밀도는 더 거대한 듯한 느낌을 줬음. 그리고 플스5의 SSD 덕분인지는 몰라도 일본어 립싱크도 훨씬 자연스러워졌고, 뭣보다 로딩 속도가 그냥 삭제된것 같았음. 고오쓰도 로딩이 빠른 게임으로 유명한데 고오쓰 디렉터즈컷은 그냥 로딩 자체가 없어진듯한 심리스 오픈월드 같이 느껴질 정도로 경이로웠음 ㄷㄷ 금나라 돌격기병대 괴자마(철부도), 고구려 개마무사처럼 말을 타고 적군들에게 돌격해 파괴시키는 돌진이나귀여운 고양이 등의 동물들이 등장한것도 귀엽고 좋았음ㅋ그래서인지 고오쓰보다 고스트 오브 쓰시마 디렉터즈컷이 훨씬 더 메타 평점이 높아진듯 ㄷㄷ"

It's 20 USD for the DLC.Hundreds of people worked on this game for for 5 years. Pouring their heart and soul into this beautiful game with ZERO microtransactions. They gave us Legends FOR FREE. WHAT THE ACTUAL **** IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? They added 10 dollars worth of content to justify the 10 dollar upgrade to the PS5 version. Ya'll are the ****ing worst.

83,PMG-Writer,"Aug 25, 2021",9,"Sony and the developers at Sucker Punch released a great title in terms of gameplay and graphics, Ghost of Tsushima, for the PS4 and PlayStation 5, then as now. The storyline and the many little narratives will keep you in front of the TV for hours. In terms of gameplay, you'll be able to completely let off steam and the developers will always give you a free rein. Thanks to the new expansion, you'll get even more content and you should definitely go to the island of Iki. Nevertheless, the camera doesn't always run perfectly. On the other hand, the graphics and the great soundtrack can once again collect important points for the overall rating. If you own the game or get the full load of Ghost of Tsushima on your PlayStation 5, you won't be disappointed in either case."

I just don't think that it's fair that this game get review bombed, because some people are unsatisfied with paying for an upgraded version.I will get a PS5, when either of the following points are made out, and when it's available of course:1. If a new PS5 model comes out that's not backwards compatible2. If there comes a special edition version af a PS5 that's unique.3. If there begins to come exclusives out only on PS5. I look forward to get to this game at some point - maybe only in a matter of one month from here, I might get it on PS4, men of course I will have to try and enjoy the Director's Cut edition on the PS5, when I finally get to that point."

If you enjoyed GOT at lauch you will enjoy the DLC. People are review bombing it just for the 10$ you have to pay to get the PS5 upgrade. I understand it isn't great but there's no need to review this game with a 0, just don't buy it and shut up.

The 4k resolution looks beautiful on my OLED tv, its so beautiful in HDR. and those are just some of the ps5 improvements. its 60fps at 4k, amazing.the DLC itself is so good, so much new stuff. new ways to play, just brilliant. i wont spoil anything. play it yourself."
103,Deathbyrope,"Aug 24, 2021",10,"This is the best possible version for one of the best games of the last generation. The new island, new enemies, duelsense and 3D audio features, along with the real world feeling they captured is just incredible. It's a must play especially if you haven't played it previously."
104,PilotoIrineuJr,"Aug 30, 2021",10,Comprei o jogo em mídia física e estou super feliz com o jogo é com os conteúdos extras. Valeu cada centavo. Quem está reclamando nem comprou o jogo.
105,ghostofspiderma,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"Never played the original, but having a blast with the new version.  Story is solid (at least from the few hours I've played), combat is a blast, haptics may not be quite as good as Returnal but it still gets some use out of the controller too.  Based on the negative reviews the biggest problem with this title is a company wanting to be paid for their work."
106,Gerald0,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"Ghost of Tsushima is amazing. The art direction, soundtrack, story, combat, everything is so good. The iki island DLC is worth it"

109,iovanovmarcel,"Aug 24, 2021",10,"Amazing game. Hardly any bugs, working well on my PS5. I was worried that waiting for an upgrade might not be worth it, but it is. I didn't play the game until the PS5 version came out, and I'm glad I waited. Worth the Full price"
110,Spencersboy,"Aug 24, 2021",10,"I wish me dad could get games of this quality on gamepass. But sadly he can't.  Xbox game studios don't have the talent. Another masterpeice from Sony's 1st party studios. This time with higher framerates, enhanced graphics, and whole extra Island to explore. Brilliant."

115,LordPakos,"Aug 22, 2021",9,"People that give this game 0 or zeros in general should not leave reviews at all. Bunch of retards, the game must be reviewed overall and not because you don t like the camera or rhe quests. Said that, the game is amazing, it's a nice view to the Shogun japanese era, the rhytm in the game is very good with main quest perfectly mix with secondary quests. Basivally it' an Assassin's creed but for growth people with real game combat mechanics. Naturally it's not a 10 because perfection doesn't exists, but it's one of the most solid open world game out there."
116,SMPVDrakeValken,"Aug 22, 2021",10,Ghost Of Tsushima: Director's Cut is a phenomenal expansion to a masterpiece of a game. The PS5 Dualsense features and the new Iki Island expansion lets us explore both the land and the heart of Jin Sakai with more immersion and the combat improvements are also great. 100% recommend this game for both new comers and people should upgrade if they already own the game.
117,bibi30077,"Aug 21, 2021",9,Le jeux à une direction artistique de folie le gameplay est super cool malgré quelques soucis de caméra lors de certains combat mais le reste est juste magique
118,kstormtrooper13,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"This game is absolutely amazing!!!I can write a whole book about this game and it’s greatness. I haven’t ever been this enticed by a game even before launch in my entire life. I purchased Ghost the day it came out for PS4 in July 2020 and ascended and experienced Jin’s journey as a samurai and as the Ghost. No story was as compelling as Jin’s, in my opinion, in a long time, and I have been gaming my entire life.Upon purchasing DLC (Director’s Cut) for Iki Island for my PlayStation 5, I kept checking to see when the game was downloaded, as I was eager to play and find out so much more about Jin’s story and his past. Finally, after what felt like forever (it wasn’t that long), I got to sit down and explore Iki Island. I played the story first, finished it in 3 hours and my God… I thought the initial story had me in my feelings, but the Iki Island story and tales had me cry more than once. It was so emotional, so captivating and just felt like I could feel everything as if I were Jin himself. I didn’t want to put my controller down not once. After completing the story I have explored Ikishima, still exploring to find other things I have yet to come across and complete other tales so I can indulge and dive more into Jin’s life and the overall story, and just overall, the scenic beauty is breathtaking and astronomically out of this world.The adaptive triggers and haptic feedback are so much fun and make the game so much more personal. It’s not everyone’s favorite, but to each their own. I also love how the new duels and just battles throughout the island challenge me more than they did on Tsushima overall, especially when weapons are switched on you. It’s definitely improved my dueling skills and makes the game more fun, in addiction to the DualSense added features. The swords clashing, the way gallops from Sora (or whatever you name your horse) vary in feeling whether on rock or on land… Ghost of Tsushima’s Director’s Cut does not disappoint. I was weary at first of the price tag, but not opposed, as I loved the game so I was willing to throw down whatever for the extra content. I’m so glad I did.Amazing job, Suckerpunch Productions. Definitely looking forward to a sequel!"
119,Coastal2009,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"I understand why it’s getting review bombed, the cost. But this is an amazing game."
120,TrainNkill,"Aug 21, 2021",10,Sad to see many fanboys of other platforms trashing a game they’ve never even played. Ghost of Tsushima was one of the best titles of 2020 and it just got so much better. The new DLC is long and beautiful. Exploring the world was as fun and exciting as the first time. Thank you SP
121,BK75,"Aug 21, 2021",10,Incredible experience and a perfect stop-gap until we can play the full sequel. Great additions like the new Armors and Horse armor. Mythic tales and new duels. The antagonist is also different and interesting.The story in particular delves deeper into Jins backstory and is really great.
122,wellwhynot,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Map feels empty and lifeless. You can travel around, but there's nothing to explore or find. Everything is so boring in this game. Hard pass."

129,Inuyasha17,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, and Sekiro are definitely excellent in melee combat, sword fighting action, and hitting feel, but above all, each melee sword fighting battle motion is so cool that it feels like a real sword fight."

138,XxHunterxX,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Definitely one of the best looking games on the PS5. Nearly everything is top tier in this game except I find climbing pretty bad, the AI can sometimes be dumb and few other nit picks is why the game didn't get a 10 from me"
139,nerudra2,"Aug 21, 2021",10,The addition of iki island makes this an already great game greater. Was surprised with the horse charging mechanic and its implementation. The visuals are topnotch. The new sarugami armor brings a new playstyle to the table. And did I mention the visuals? every few meters I'd stop in awe.
140,Guazeveds,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"An good upgrade for an great game but not worth to pay the whole price again, i think sony has problems to share about the PS4 to PS5 upgrade it was kinda confusing to some people handle it"

I personally really regret buying it."
150,Pavel56,"Aug 22, 2021",1,Ужасно. В 2021 году компания сони занимается откровенным крабежом пользователей. Я обладатель версии для ps4 вынужден доплачивать отдельно версию для ps5 где разница визуально минимальна! Ещё и дополнение крошечное проходится быстро и оно не стоит 2100 руб.
151,Dagevilight2,"Aug 22, 2021",3,"Un relanzamiento mediocre... el juego tiene un downgrade visual a comparación de la versión de ps4 y no vale la pena pagar por eso. A final de cuentas es el mismo juego del año pasado, es un Assassin's Creed insípido y que se torna aburrido en jornadas de juego largas. Gráficamente se ve bien, pero es más por el estilo artístico que por la densidad gráfica en general."
152,nokcastro,"Aug 22, 2021",0,I would gladly pay for the DLC but charging consumers for a PS5 Upgrade where it should be free is pure corporate greed.
153,VergiI,"Aug 22, 2021",0,"Добро пожаловать в новое поколение от сони, где вам будут продавать игры с пастгена заново и за полную цену и где за разблокировку главных фишек PS5 вам в каждой игре придется доплачивать, ведь так всегда было, что если у тебя например есть RTX видеокарта, то тебе приходилось платить больше, чем тем, у кого RTX небыло. Хотя подождите, такого небыло! Тогда какого хрена я должен доплачивать за то, чтобы моя PS5 работала на полную, что это за налог на некстген? Я уже купил PS5, это моя пивилегия пользоваться её фишками, а не повод содрать с меня лишнее бабло. Не говоря уже о том, что инвестировать в ваши новые игры на релизе становится невыгодно, ведь вы просто выпускаете director's cut по полной стоимости, но даже новый покупатель заплатит меньше, чем пришлось заплатить мне за оригинал на релизе и доп контент с некстген апгрейдом. Видимо сони пытаются по максимуму показать мне, насколько я был не прав не сменив консоль после пяти поколений с ними. TranslationWelcome to the new generation from Sony, where you will be sold games from pastgen again and at full price and where you will have to pay extra for unlocking the main PS5 chips in each game, because it has always been that if you have an RTX video card, for example  had to pay more than those who did not have RTX.  Wait, it never happened!  Then why the hell should I pay extra to keep my PS5 running at full capacity, what is this nextgen tax?  I already bought a PS5, it's my privilege to use its chips, and not a reason to rip off extra loot from me.  Not to mention that it becomes unprofitable to invest in your new games on release, because you just release the director's cut at full cost, but even a new buyer will pay less than I had to pay for the original on release and additional content with nextgen upgrade.  Apparently Sony are trying to show me as much as possible how wrong I was without changing the console after five generations with them"

But i don't even wanna compare it to AC, but GOT is way inferior. Where's parkour? Where's good camera controls? Where's fast paced combat? It has none of it. Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag (2013) blows this game out of water, no pun intended."

201,sonesean96,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Perfect update for already perfect game. Don't listen bad reviews, those are probably just angry Xbots. The game was already great, and this upgrade made it even better."
202,elfisto,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"People saying "" IhhH NoThinG NeW!?!"" dont know what they are talking about there are improvments to the base game and also a whole new dlc with Ikki Island that adds 20-30 Hours of Playtime so 20/30$ is ok for this version of the game. And its still the best looking game out there and so much fun."
203,AyrtonBR,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"Que una expansion tenga tanto contenido como si se tratase de una nueva entrega se merece todo el reconocimiento y merito, es una pasada y el precio esta muy bien, vale cada centavo y es la mejor vesion del juego con todas las mejoras y contenido nuevo, sin duda uno de los mejores juegos de play junto a God of War y The Last of Us"
204,DefinitiveBrent,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"All these 0/10 ratings are completely bogus. The game was fantastic before, and the DC has brought some noticeable and welcome changes. Iki island is a short story path, but the island itself has lots to explore. 3D audio, dual sense features, and noticeable resolution bump push this over the top from a 9 to an easy 10."
205,Jayguino,"Aug 21, 2021",10,"The game may not look much different graphically but the haptic feedback and DLC are fantastic. I spent about 10 hours on Iki island playing the story and exploring the place. If you want to spend the money and don’t mind $30 for the DLC and upgrades then do it. These people giving 0s act like they were forced into paying. The reviews were out beforehand and if you didn’t like it then why did you buy it? To complain? Like I said, if you don’t mind paying $30 for the game then go for it. If it’s an issue then don’t buy it and buy the PS4 version for $20. I loved the game and this DLC was good. Looking forward to the new game mode coming out in Legends as well!"
206,B-I-G-DEVIL,"Aug 21, 2021",8,"Ghost Of Tsushima Directors cut brings more of what we love about Ghost Of Tsushima , we learn more about clan Sakai dark past whilst fighting a unique threat from the mongol leader “The Eagle” Frame rates are more stable on PS5 version, haptic feedback greatly improves the immersion through the clang of weapons parrying to the purring of cats at the sanctuaries. Adaptive triggers also implemented mainly when using the bow but also the grapple hook. Gameplay is improved with more advanced AI, who will change weapons mid combat requiring you to adjust your approach to face the enemy. As well as shamans who will buff the enemy making a lethal play through even more costly if you mistime your attack or defence during combat. More gear is unlockable through armour, charms etc bringing new ways to play the game. Grapple hook also enhanced to help traverse around camps more easily to plan the perfect ambush. Horse mechanic also upgrades so that your loyal companion can join in the fight taking down crowds of mongols in no time. As well as saddle bags which you can store materials on to replenish any of Jin’s missing gear the next time he jumps on."

Ten bucks for the PS5 upgrade is well earned by Sucker Punch, the 3D audio, higher res (slightly), and haptic feedback/adaptive trigger implementation is spot on! Considering they added the Legends multiplayer mode for free, and are also updating that with more content, FOR FREE! It's not hard to shell out that extra ten, I would have paid more."

226,xD7m,"Aug 22, 2021",6,"I played the game at launch and got the platinum in a week and i loved the game and when they announced the dlc i was excited and pre order it and i paid 20$ thinking that it comes with the PS5 upgrade but It didn’t, you have to pay 10$ for the PS5 upgrade and know that i think about it why buy an upgrade for the console you paid 500$ for,The PS5 owners should get the PS5 version for free as advertised I didn’t buy a whole PS5 to pay more.About the dlc it was short for a 20$ it took me about 7 hours to clear the iki island.And i hope they support the legends mode it has potential.Thank you."
227,cumnacho,"Aug 22, 2021",8,"Since there’s a lot of review bombing with that has very nit picky crying and others just straight up trashing it, I’d say read em and think for yourself. No form of media deserves to get review bombed because people are spiteful and have nothing better to do.Positive feedback: I personally liked the game, and for those who are willing to spend $20-30 on the new content, I highly recommend it. If you don’t care about the PS5 features then save the $10. Visually the game is beautiful. I personally like the haptic feedback from the controller, I don’t find it gimmicky. Negatives: Some side missions are a bit boring and may seem similar, but unless you’re a completionist they’re not mandatory to do if you don’t find it fun. As I said before the game is beautiful, but I don’t really notice much of a difference between how it was on the PS4 version over the current. You can overall expect a good looking game. I don’t really care about the price, it didn’t upset me and no one held a gun to my head telling me I had to purchase it. If you’re on the fence over it, maybe wait until it goes on sale. Sony puts out sales constantly and it won’t be long until this game is discounted.Overall, I hope whoever took the time out to read this looks at this and other reviews objectively and continue enjoying video games. It’s a fun game and worth buying."

235,Raios-Rogue,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"Ghost of tsushima director's cut deserves to be 93 on metacritic its just as good as the Last Of Us Part II if not even better it's the pinacle of action adventure open world game and Iki island has the best wave physics in the gaming industry literally no game out there does wave physics like ghost of tsushima does in iki island the waves connect with rocks you can feel everything thanks to the excellent haptic feedback how the waves clash and if you try to get near the waves while your standing on top of a rock where they clash and you though your body is gonna go true the wave like it doesn't exist like in other games your in for a surprise the waves will smack you and your body will be launched by the force literally no other game does this.the haptics are great you can feel the horse running pulling the grappling hook to remove wood blocking an entrance swinging your katana pulling the string of your bow and the adaptive triggers provide plenty of immersive resistance but something thats even more immersive is the phenomenal 3d audio its briliantly done you can hear everything like your in 3D cinema the rain the thunder the waves your katana parrying and clashing with the enemy's katana its amazing the boost from 3200x1800 on ps4 pro to 3840x2160 gives the game such a boost in clarity and sharpness the textures are crystal clear i went to the highest mountain on IKI island to see from the highest peak staring down below the glorious beauty of it all and the performance of this game is fluid 60fps locked and ik island what an amazing expansion singing with the flute to monkeys cats deers petting them fantastic mini games like the memories of Jin's Father Kazumasa to fantastic hidden eastearn eggs like god of war bloodborne shadow of the collosus armor sets to amazing story side quests and mythic tales the horse armor is so good and the new monkey armor is my favorite. The japanese lip sync is fantastic makes the real time scenes feel like a movie playing in real time all thanks to the powerful GPU of the PS5 and the fastest SSD on the planet.There is a few really nice additions like the option to remap controls to melee attack like sekiro dark souls light attack R1 heavy attack R2 and you can hide your quiver to make your armor sets look even more dope and don't make me start on how much you can customize your look in this game and the lock on as an option further improves the game and the combat which this game has one of the best combat systems and abilities in gaming history. The only few things that could have made this better is if sucker punch upgraded the graphics if they made this more than a simple remaster because there is a small change to graphics but its minor its just a normal remaster and i feel like Iki island could have used a few more mythic tales and more new abilities but the lenght of it is fine people its the lenght of a full game its one of the best expansions i have played right up there with Witcher 3 blood and wine Hearts Of Stone Monster hunter world Iceborne expansions and after the ps5 version came out the game stablity isn't as good as before the game is definitely more buggy than before director's cut it was almost ideal with minor bugs the armor builds sets take a few seconds to load but in general the load times of the game are blazing fast. I can see the angry xbots placing bad reviews some of them say they are tired of RPGS this is not an RPG its an action adventure open world game the other xbot says he played the ps4 version 11 months ago but Ghost of tsushima released 2020 july 17  1 year 1 month 5 days ago so he hasn't played it at all i'm,sure most of the xbots haven't played this game which i have platinumed i don't know how metacritic is allowing the angry xbox mob to review bomb this game they are not even trying to hide the fact that they are review bombing this game by calling us ponies and saying Microsoft pro consumer Sucker punch robbed me lackluster short DLC no improvements 70$ gamepass Xbox good Sony bad Sony robbing their fanbase they are taking their frustration on a beautifully crafted masterpiece which they will never experience on xbox because halo infinite will come out half baked without campaign co op and forge and it will flop.Ghost Of Tsushima Director's Cut is an emotional artistically breahtaking beautiful masterpiece From character story combat gameplay AI music audio voiced actors in japanese game stability graphics animations everything is a work of art !"

I absolutely love Playstation 4 and Playstation 5 and i also play on PC, but i deeply hate when some people hype some games up, just cause they are ""exclusive"". By the way i'm pretty sure this game comes eventually to PC, Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn already came and those are way better games than GOT. Best Playstation exclusives are Spider-Man 2018 and Bloodborne, nothing else gets even close."

251,Sarulade,"Aug 22, 2021",10,Ghost of Tsushima was one of my favourite games last year and now we got Iki expansion for the base game and just like my expectations it’s a great additional content which still satisfied my hunger for more of it for now at least. Can’t wait for the new legends content too!
252,Lamoi,"Aug 22, 2021",9,"IGNORE these complete twerps that are review bombing this game! Why I do not know…Pathetic. This is one of the best games of the last 15yrs. If you’re a fan of Feudal Japan, Samurai’s or Ninja — and are tired of the usual over the top fantasy that usually comes with this setting and has saturated gaming for years e.g Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, Onimusha, Nioh etc the list is endless… But yes, if you we’re crying out for something more authentic, realistic — then this is the game you! If you have always dreamed of a game that gives you that Samurai / Ninja fantasy — you will love this game! This game doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it’s highly polished and been made with a lot of love for the subject matter. The combat is excellent, incredibly well animated and skill based. The stealth is satisfying, with a decent collection of items that can be employed giving that player a good number of options. Ultimately the stealth is let down at times by some poor AI. It’s not the worst, but it can be pretty dumb at times. I’ve played alot of stealth games my time and am along time Tenchu fan and I enjoy the stealth in this game. But don’t go in expecting Splinter Cell. Story is decent, held up mostly by some significant performances. Could of used fleshing out a bit more but some pretty strong emotional beats along the way that are noteworthy. The DLC — is worth the money. If you love GoT then IKI Island is a no brainer. Perhaps a wee bit light on actual new features or mechanics, but then this is not a sequel, it just a story expansion."

274,Darkvenom39,"Aug 31, 2021",6,"Ok this is about the directors cut and not the main game itself. i am talking about the dlc as well as the extra 10$ upgrade. This score and review is mostly intended for people who already own the game before this upgrade. But Non the less the main game itself is a masterpiece and a must play by all means! the main game is a 10/10!But now to the directors cut, honestly if you own a ps5. dont pay the extra 10$ the upgrade is minimal and even the new haptic feedback and quality of life improvements are really minimal and not something to go wild about. Yes its 10$ but i would of probably spent that money on a bag of shrimps for dinner tonight lol.The dlc of iki island Is a beautiful place to look at and just roam around, just like the main game. The island is very very tiny and its even slightly smaller than the first area of the map in the main game. The story of the expansion has so much potential yet its very very short (like 5 hours, no joke you can complete it in less than one playthrough) and totally not worth that 20$ price tag while AC Valhalla with all its flaws delivers a better expansion imo...Overall wait for sale. dont jump in right away if you already own the game. but if its your first time getting into this game, then im jealous, youre going to have a blast of an experience!"
275,Steddag1,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"Finally Ghost of Tsushima gets a better score, but still deserve higher. The dualsense implementation with the haptic feedback and adaptative triggers make it feel like a new game. The new Island Ikki DLC, new armor, new stance, new horse armor, and new enemies and boss. The $20 for the PS4 and $30 for  the Ps5 so worth it."
276,Chrisxdxl,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"Brilliant game, great stealth mechanics and even better combat. The visuals are amazing and the performance is very consistent. The story is amazing and extremely immersive, I can't think if a single thing wrong with it."

DualSense controller additions for PS5 are really well done.  I had alread played this game through New Game & New Game+ as well as grinding out the online Legends mode and was really looking forward to more content.

I’m not criticising the game for having paid for DLC but I feel the whole upgrade process is just a cash grab as I already own the game but to unlock those PS5 controller features I need to re-buy the game I already own. Not a happy PlayStation customer at the moment with the double charging practices that Sony are currently using with some cross generation games.

One of the reason their interested in multiplayer games. It is unbelievable that 3rd party companies like EA, Ubisoft and CD Project and many more offering free upgrade while sony and its studios are charging money when they should be the one setting the standard for this, - 4K & 60FPS(Should be free)- Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback(Should be free)- Japanese lip sync(Not necessary for game but should have been in the game day 1 for free) New island DLC ($10-$15 Max) This is what they did with Spider Man, Now Ghost of Tsushima and Next Death Stranding.And how dare they use Directors Cut to sell all this when its nothing to do with it and is just ports. Reason i didn't buy Spider-Man Remastered and not gonna buy future games day 1 when Sony will just do this for everything. I hope more people open their eyes and vote with their wallet and speaks out. How low gaming has fallen when the industry leader first party pulls this crap. Id never say this but Microsoft is being so much consumer centric and listens to their customers then Sony."

The open world setting is always interesting and the gameplay loop is always compelling. I don't understand the hate with sonys charging structure when you can play the ps4 version in back compatibility  mode at 60 frames per second via a previous free update to the game FOR FREE. Its really fascinating how Sonys first party games from last generation on ps4 actually transfer across to ps5 and look like next gen games. Astonishing.

Iki island was enjoyable. It did add to the story of the Ghost. The main story was pretty good. The Eagle was a good enemy- not as good as Khan, but pretty good. The graphics and frame rate on the PS5 are exceptional! Perhaps the best looking game of all time! On the con side- this was pretty short at only about 5 hours for the main story. There were a few side quests- but they weren’t all that great. But I guess about as good as the main game. Overall I’m glad I played it. But with it’s short length I’m not sure it justifies the price. Will look forward to whenever a full sequel comes out."

I'm very glad I waited too as I also upgraded my TV to an LG C1 OLED and boy this game is an ABSOLUTE STUNNING MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!! IF you have any reservations about this game DON'T. Buy it NO QUESTIONS asked. As for the idiot's review bombing the game, do not listen to that BS. These crybabies are mad cuz there is an OPTIONAL DLC and OPTIONAL PS5 upgrade that in NO way is required to enjoy the game on your PS4, unless you want the new Iki Island expansion ofc, and you also DO NOT need the PS5 upgrade to already enjoy this beautiful game in stunning 1440-1800P at 60 FPS with the PS4 version played on a PS5."

Also the added lip sync to jp audio makes it a little better to watch the cutscenes even though its nowhere perfect but it wasn't in the English one either so no big deal.This is just more GOT and im all for it.Screw the haters, sure im not that much of a fan of the 10 bucks upgrade as it should have been free imo. But i think the game deserves the extra cash and then some for giving us such a great experience with the multiplayer for free. Also to you people saying there is no difference from this game on ps5 and ps4. You either 1 need stronger glasses or 2 have not played it and are lying.Because there are distinct changes to the game on ps5 that ps4 users can only dream of.With crazy fast load times, 60 fps native 4k and haptic feedback from the controller there are plenty of great stuff added to a already legendary game so please STFU"

The graphics looks amazing, so much better and they even added a high contrast mode that makes the colors more vibrant. The dlc is very long, 20 hours in and I barely made a dent (doing side stuff too) and I am just in love with this directors cut. Don’t listen to the review bombers who don’t even have a ps5 saying it’s worse. It’s soooo much better. They’re review bombing cuz they think a ten dollar upgrade is BS but they fail to realize it isn’t just frame rate and graphics. They changed a ton of stuff and give you the legendary deluxe items too! Plus dlc. If you wanna wait for a sale fine but don’t let these mean negative Xbox guys stop you from trying this amazing game out. My favorite game is Witcher 3 and this reminds me of that. I absolutely love it. My total hours I put in the game are about 65 on one save and my map is still half discovered."

384,Maclauser,"Aug 26, 2021",0,Esses preços para a realidade financeira atual (que já está ruim a anos) do Brasil tornam impossível de se adquirir qualquer jogo.

385,Gaelwhite,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"After spending more than 1000 hours GOT PS4 I was excited to play the PS5 version. My only complain is that it seems there are no significant graphical upgrade from the last gen version except for resolution bump. However the game is still pretty with the different locations. Where the PS5 version shines is the use of it’s features. Loading screen has almost gone. It take from 1 second or between 2 to 3 seconds to load depending on the location you are fast travelling to. Very impressive. I never thought I would say that but I miss the tips from loading screen of the PS4 version with the beautiful art style. My most anticipated featured was the Dualsense implementation. You get a feedback from almost everything from the game: menu screen, cutscenes, rolling, riding on wood bridge or rock from your horse, sword clashing and even when playing the flute. Did it surpass Astro Playroom? I don’t know but its very good. It will be hard to go to PS4 version to collect remaining trophies of Iki Island. The Director’s Cut comes with the above mentioned expansion and it does not disappoint. Like the main game, the new island has beautiful location to explore. My favorite is simply scaling the white marble like cliff. Iki introduce new activities to do outside the main quest like the Archer mastery challenge that will test your skills or the animal sanctuary that will provide with new charms that will change your play style. Speaking of which, two new mythic tales to get awesome rewards from both. The first one is horse armor to charge towards your enemies. I truly believe this feature was missing from the main game. The second one will get you a new armor for Jin that make gameplay comes with risk reward situation. Least to say its my new favorite armor. I started a NG+ to play with it. Since the PS5 version dropped, I have noticed some drop in quality of matchmaking in Legends mode. In average it takes longer to have a match. In average between 1m30 to 3m. Also during a match, if a player has left a session and you select “ search other player for matchmaking” to bring a new player during the session, it never works. It keep searching but no one comes in. This happened in 100% matches that a player has left. Sucker Punch will need to add an option to turn off adaptive trigger for hunter class only. ( I don’t want to use the general one as I love it in the main campaign )   Overall I 100% recommend GOT DC for any new player."

393,Noriyori,"Aug 23, 2021",9,"The PS4 version was already the pinnacle of what is possible on that console. The upgrade to PS5 bring even better visuals and a surprisingly excellent multiplayer mode. Iki Island is stunning (like the rest of the game). The combat is nuanced and relies on timing and skill. Yes, it's a continuation of the base game. There's a lot of **** here with review bombers - those that are actually genuine complaining that the DLC isn't actually Ghost of Tsushima 2 and too similar to the base - it's an expansion - stop whining. if you want quality developers like Sucker Punch to survive, pay the money and stop whingeing with your unrealistic expectations. Would've been 10 out of 10 if there was a 2 player online tournament option for each of the some of the legends classes."

The Iki island expansion is great, not too short but not to long, just right. The visuals and combat are still brilliant and I'm glad they added Japanese lip syncing to make the game feel even more immersive for those who like to play the game SUB. 11/10 for me, great job SuckerPunch."

402,rene0023,"Aug 27, 2021",1,El juego es exactamente lo mismo que el original excepto que este tiene una actualizacion de graficos y aprovecha las mecanicas nuevas que el control de PS5 ofrece. Creo que fue una movida muy avara por parte de Sony cobrar por un parche next gen cuando todos los estudios estan ofreciendo esos parches completamente gratis como lo hizo Square Enix con FF7 y el DLC ofrecerlo como una opcion y no venderlo junto al parche. Realmente Sony abusa de nosotros sus fans pero mientras sigamos justificandolos seguiran haciendo este tipo de movimientos sin mencionar el alza de los precios de sus juegos exclusivos.
403,DarkShadowC83,"Aug 25, 2021",0,"This isn't a director's cut. A director's cut is a work that embodies the original piece and things that were left behind because of production budget or publisher's decisions. This is just the same game with a DLC withholding PS5 upgrades and features to blackmail the PlayStation fans into buying the 19,99€ of extra content. Even, they charge you more if you want the PS5 version, 10 more, and that is nonsense in an industry full of free upgrades. This time, Sony has crossed the line."

405,PerseusHawk,"Aug 22, 2021",10,It was a great game on PS4 and now it's been updated for PS5... it's basically a game of the year edition if you buy it the first time or you can buy the upgrade which is basically your run if the mill DLC ordeal. Overall a good package for those who have not played it and an affordable upgrade path for those on last gen looking to upgrade to PS5 for the graphics and/or IMO the most important upgrade: the DualSense features! Almost makes it feel like a new game!

414,BigPuppyShoes,"Aug 22, 2021",10,"This is one of those games where I actually use photo mode to enjoy how beautiful everything looks. Gameplay is the best in class for sword fighting really makes you fell like a samurai. Just something about it so satisfying and now that we can replay enemy camps and duals it’s a paradise. Specially since there are so many different and unique builds you can create it never gets boring. With addition of new charms and outfits abilities they added it’s pretty much your playground at this point. But of course you can also use charms that make the game even more challenging on lethal. Top this off with legends online mode being completely free with so much more content and more to come on September 3rd. You can see how I got over 500+ hours clocked in and way more to come. This game is just awesome and it’s own story as well specially the ending, highly recommend."

The game does look better, the performance is amazing. It's the best money you'll spend for a DLC."

Was just too busy at the time to dive into a big game, I had just gotten Last of us 2 and couldn’t commit to another heavy hitter at the time.  I’m glad I waited until I got the ps5 and the directors cut. Completely worth the 70 bucks. I dont have a lot of time to play mediocre games. Services like game pass does not work for my schedule.  I’m a family man and a business man, my time is scare and I can’t sift through games that aren’t great. When I sit down to play a game I want the best experience possible and that is why I’m a PlayStation head. This game is phenomenal. From that opening scene that sent chills down my spine, the story, the action, the haptics and the FPS with 4K are all stunning. I still can’t believe this was out on PS4, they squeezed every once of juice out of that previous gen. I’ve had some downtime the last 3 days and put some major time in, and have barely scratched the surface. This will be the game I play for months as I go for platinum."
435,Navegani,"Aug 22, 2021",9,The looks and plays amazing on ps5. The Japanese voiceacting is really well done and makes want to replay the game again just to get used to Japanese voice Jin Sakai. 30$ is a bit much for the upgrade but the game is really worth it if you haven't played it already. The upgrade also added 3d audio and dualsense features which actually adds alot of alot to the experience. You feel every arrow you shot and  it just something nice to the experience but not essential if you don't want to pay the extra 10$. If you don't want to play the dlc you can just get the ps4 version which has 4k 60fps support on ps5. The game loads a bit longer and the cinematic are real time rendering in the ps5 version compared to the pre rendered cinematics in the ps4. Both version cinematics are set to 30fps tho.

Os upgrades feitos nele são quase inexistentes, e a DLC não compensa tudo isso.

The addition of Iki island as the real story goes is an interesting move by the studio.A lot of things to explore in an amazing well built world, the combat system is satisfying and a well structured story with emotional events all along.I would recommend as I don't see any game studios doing what Sony studios are doing and especially suckerpunch for this masterpiece."

Not being a hug fan of the genre, I found it very difficult to relate to the characters, and they definitely were not likable in my opinion. I didn't feel invested in the story and found it difficult to justify playing. The abilities that you get as you progress will slightly mix up your play style and the feel of the game but not enough. Enemies are almost exclusively mundane humans which is okay when you don't have a point of comparison. However, if you've played God of War, Demons Souls, The Last of Us, Returnal, or even Horizon Zero Dawn (all games with enemies and abilities that draw on supernatural sources of inspiration) then the enemies in this game will be quite bland by comparison. I may return to this game once I've exhausted all the other amazing and free games in the Play Station collection, but until then this purchase is nothing more than a regret now collecting dust in my game library."

489,iMustang,"Sep  8, 2021",10,"As a lifelong fan of Sucker Punch, I took a full month to play through their newest masterpiece, Ghost of Tsushima. Much like Naughty Dog had progression from platforming with Crash Bandicoot, to Jak & Daxter, and arriving to large storytelling with Uncharted & The Last of Us, Sucker Punch has done the same. Sly Cooper served as their foundation, Infamous was honest fun, and now Ghost of Tsushima surpasses them both and pushes them to that same level of masterful storytelling. Ghost of Tsushima is an absolute beauty. The gorgeous environments are so breathtaking I could spend another month just riding around the beautiful island of Tsushima, seeing falling leaves, crashing waves, and adorable foxes. Being put in the shoes of a lovable main character in Jin adds another level of joy as he struggles with the concept of right and wrong based from how he was raised versus how the pain of war unfolds. Along the way you meet many characters with their own side quest lines, and honestly they were equally as enjoyable as the main story. The combat in this game was also perfection; Sucker Punch clearly learned a lot from both Sly Cooper and Infamous and put them both to work here, mixing elements of hack and slash with stealth and techniques, this game truly was perfection from beginning to end. It's also very generous with checkpoints and giving you a bit of health if you keep dying at any portions. If I have any complaint at all about this game, it's only a minor gripe about some of the side-quests and some of the main narrative. This is not a happy game; it has beautiful moments and things that make you smile, but this is war and war is not pretty, and sometimes the side-quests reflect this by being terribly depressing with no good feels to walk away with, and I do prefer a bit of balance. But that really is a tiny drop in the a large beautiful ocean that is Ghost of Tsushima."
490,snke,"Sep 10, 2021",9,"Ghost of Tsushima is an amazing journey, a sensational narrative driven by the imagination of the devs.  A deep dive into feudal Japan. A masterpiece. The directors cut is the first time I've experienced the game, on a PS5. I had my doubts regarding the reviews and the reception but... OH BOY what a treat of a game it was. This my review based on 60 hours of playtime. Narration/Story: It is no doubt a long story, however the narrative, the characters, the scenery, the world design bring the game to life. It  pushes you to literally imagine your self being in that era. Every character has a story to tell (tales as the game calls them). Every part of their story brings you closer to them. You feel their anger, the distress, the pain, it connects you on a level, that I never though possible in a game. It is exceptionally crafted to showcase a journey through pain. I wont spoil anything. Combat. You can approach any fight the way you want. There are 4 stances to choose seamlessly, appropriate for each type of enemy. Simple skill trees that will not overwhelm you. Amazing animations and finishers transform you into Rurouni Kenshin. Wanna go all out? go for it, want a stealthy approach? feel free. There is no limit.  The bottom line is that the combat of GoT is a pure satisfaction. This is a brief review of my time with GoT, there is no doubt in my mind that this is among the best games on PS4/PS5 and among my top 5. (on Playstation) Tips: Play this game in Japanese Dialogue. Spot on voice acting that adds a level of immersion that English dialogue simply cannot. If you are an One piece fan, Jin Sakai (main character) has the same voice actor as ZORO. It is surprising to see so many bad reviews. Either they are trolls that never played the game, or they got into the game with the wrong expectations. Do your self a favor and play this game. Well worth the price. 9/10 ez"

494,dangyosabyss,"Sep 28, 2021",10,"More new content and a whole stunning island to explore. This is DLC done right. And the upgrade to ps5 specs makes the game even more beautiful. You will not regret buying this game. See my previous review below: Ghost of Tsushima is a stunning game. I have never before played a game with such a vibrant open world. It feels lived-in, it feels living. Before GoT I never experienced ASMR from a video game. Now I do. The falling of leaves, petals etc make this a magical world akin to something from a Studio Ghibli film. Equal parts Journey, Bushido Blade and Tenchu this is a game that has been constructed to please the people who forked out for it. Comparing it to TLOU2 is unfair to Naughty Dog because GoT blows it away. I dont know why anyone would choose TLOU2's edgelord nihilism over the magic of GoT - a game whose creators went out of their way to make enjoyable. Also comparisons to Assassins Creed persist but speaking as a fan of AC since the first one (though not so much recently) I am not throwing the games under the bus when I say that AC has never been this good. Not even close. Jin Sakai is a great MC who veers away from the preaching that has become commonplace in Western games and proves that gamers do not need forced MCs who mirror them at the threat of twitter mob outrage. There could be a case made that it is not as long as some other open world games but I would counter that there is no extraneous flab in GoT. Just classy, relevant substance. Its side missions serve a purpose, add to the plot and build the world Jin is trying to save. The add fuel to Jin's desire to save it at all costs. It is so refreshing to have side missions that serve a purpose and aren't just 'Deliver this persons frying pan'. It is a game that makes you care about its casts philosophies without badgering you with encyclopedias on why you're supposed to care (a la Death Stranding). Its world is magical and you want to protect it as much as Jin does. It isnt an exercise in making you feel like crap like TLOU2. It captures the essence of nature and play (which in reality are intertwined anyway). Ghost of Tsushima is a strong contender for Game of the Year and it would take something godlike to deny it."

However, Iki island is small; about a fifth of Tsushima, and felt a bit monotone. The upgraded graphics are sometimes beautiful (flora), sometimes less so (fauna, characters, villages). Story-wise you get some back story which is quite short, also because my completely upgraded PS4 character felt overpowered. In terms of gameplay there are barely new mechanics. Bottom line: it's ok, it's just a few more missions, a bit of back back story and a new island."

510,defstm,"Sep 13, 2021",6,"A usual open world rpg style game whitch brings nothing new and keeps to the same old cliches. To start with the upgraded version, it brings some upgrades, but not some major ones. The 4k 60 is there, but the game graphics are poor, especially the characters.Verry dissapointed that they didn’t used the dualsense at more things, the adaptive triggers could be used at so many thing, yet they are used only for a single thing, the bow…. Why is this I don’t know it seems that Sp didn’t cared for this ps5 version, they trew a single feature and so they can call it ps5 version… As for the game, the story is poor, it does not make you feel anything, only at rare occasions. The characters are talking verry little, and do not express any emotion.They use a thing, that I cannot forgive, at almost all of the missions, you are teleported without any continuity. They broke the flow state and the emotion. Let’s attack the castle, black screen for a second then you are in the middle of the fight, no flow, no nothing, just teleported there.The game is also verry short, my tracked in game time is 21h for the main story. I also did a lot of side quests, and some if the legends. And I touched 21, I think the main missions are bellow 7h. (but double check online, I might be wrong, this is how it felt to me). This game got so many good reviews, I expected it to be great, but no, I paid full price for the ps5 version and I am dissapointed. It just another open world rpg, nothing new.But ofc it’s miles above ubisoft open-worlds, I sggest you play it, if you buy It at a sale and you have nothing better to play."

512,LordBarco,"Sep 17, 2021",10,"GHOST OF TSUSHIMA REVIEW I gave Ghost of Tsushima a solid 10/10, so I will not explain the base game, I will focus on the new aspects and the brand-new island of Iki SETTINGNews gets to Jin that the island of Iki is being invaded by a new Mongol ruler, the Eagle, so he departs there to stop the Mongol invasion there to avert once and for all the Mongol threat.Whilst traveling to Iki, Jin’s boat collapses in a storm and he is left stranded. Then he awakes in Iki and the story unfolds MECHANICSSimilar as with the base game, but I will add a few additional mechanics •	Exploration:Now there are animal shrine whew you use your flute to control via motion controls the rhythm of the melody, so the animal can be attracted to you. You will be rewarded with charms or enhancements to specific charms.I would have loved the option of enhancing what I want, but either way getting to these shrines is amazing.There is also know archery challenges, which are very nice and some of them are tricky. If you manage to beat them fast enough you will also be rewarded. Add the haptic feature of the PS5 controllers and you will feel a bow in your hand!Finally, you get to fight in an arena with a wooden sword. This was also cool, and the battles are directed to just one hit, to start a new round.The island of Iki is short in area compared to Tsushima (about ¼) but that does not mean exploration is easy. There is a lot of vertical areas which have difficult accesses. Exploration is still a nice addition to the perfect combat! •	Combat:Oh boy, they got it right... Mud, blood, Sweat, and Steel! and well said, as I have never played such an addictive combat gampleya which hooked me in so much... this was the beginning of my original GoT review… I stand for it in the Director’s cut as now combat has been revamped with nice additions such as a lock on feature. The Shamans will enhance enemies and they will become more aggressive, meaning they will get you with unblockable attacks repeatedly. Adding to that, now there are enemies that can change weapons during battle, and you will be changing stances even more now. Overall, combat is more challenging now.Finally, there is a new skill to charge enemies with your horse! It is a satisfying addition to add an additional tactical level to the already challenging and awesome combat •	StealthSame good stealth mode with improved assassination animations. No major changes in here, really. Stealth was good in the original, it has improved in this one with cooler animations VISUALSVisuals were great and now they have been overhauled a little more. Do not expect a major change in here as already the PS4 version was jaw dropping, but there is an improvement, and now for us lovers of Japanese Samurai cinema… there is sync lip for Japanese language. Doing this must have been really difficult as this is a RPG game and you talk with literally EVERYONE. SOUNDSoundtrack is amazing and epic, adding to an already incredible soundtrack not only for GoT but also for GoT Legends. What I love most about the soundtrack is how it adapts to the environment. FINAL VERDICTI give this game a solid 10/10. I bought the base PS4 version and I was ok to pay for the upgrade not only for the new expansion with Iki Island (which will take 10 to 15 hours to complete as a whole) but also for the revamp in the graphics, and audio. Go get it and become one of the most badass Shinobi!"
513,LilTopi,"Sep  4, 2021",9,"A lot of people misunderstand what the director's cut is. You aren't paying for the enhanced PS5 aspect, that's the bonus. For anyone that already has the base game I really do recommend you upgrade to the version you feel comfortable with; if you have 30$ to spend I'd say it's totally worth it to get the enhanced PS5 version. With that, you get the haptic feedback, adaptive triggers. 3D audio on top of the already great DLC Iki Island. If you don't care about the Dualshock features you could always upgrade to the PS4 version and get the Story expansion for just 20$. I don't get how people are calling this overpriced. It's a great addition to the already great Ghost of Tsushima story, with some added immersion when factoring in the DualSense features."

Immediately smitten I found myself search every nook and cranny for nuggets of storytelling, of lore and hints at the broader world of 1274 Tsushima, and the Sakai clan, so when the Director’s Cut was announced, with new story DLC in tow, it was exactly what this fan was looking for. Now that it’s here, it’s not at all unreasonable to conclude that the tales of Iki island have further enhanced one of 2020’s finest titles, while some smart quality of life additions improve the core game significantly as well."

524,Zski,"Sep 18, 2021",8,"So this is my review of the game, not a review of the company’s pricing decisions like all of these other reviews seem to be. Ghost of Tsushima is a tough one to review, because it has a lot of great qualities while still being relatively mundane. To me, it feels like this game is an Assassins Creed spin-off still made by Ubisoft. I found the game to be good, but not great.. The gameplay is extremely lackluster in the combat, it really feels like a refined and polished Assassins Creed game - which again isn’t a bad thing, but to be fully objective it’s not that complex. It gets a little better toward the last act in the game, but it’s fairly straight forward.  The stealth feels like the old Tenchu games, which is extremely basic, but the AI is absolutely atrocious in this game, which makes the stealth even more ridiculous. The game just gave me this unpolished feeling. The actual missions are mostly very much the same “clear this outpost” or “attack that group”, and they don’t really bring any excitement aside from moving the story forward a little bit. I very much enjoyed the story, however, It really feels that 90% of the game is filler. Act 1 is the longest act, and the storyline completely lost my attention until toward the end of Act 2. Once the story picks up, it tells a pretty good story.  The world is beautiful, although a bit empty since it’s mostly just landscapes - again it’s not a bad thing because the landscapes are stunning, but there’s not much happening and it feels very empty. The lighting and grass effects are absolutely beautiful, especially in 4K and 60fps. There are a few areas where the the textures look a bit muddy, for example, the water looks really really bad.. None of the issues are game breakers by any means, but they just add to the feeling that the game is unpolished, even on the PS5. The atmosphere is excellent, everything including the historical accuracy, the music, the voice acting, the story, it’s all fantastic. My final thoughts: the game is good, but it polishes up a formula that had existed and has been overdone for over a decade now. Aside from the atmosphere, it doesn’t do anything particularly well, but it doesn’t do a single thing bad. It’s very much overrated, but it’s definitely a worthwhile ride."

526,Tuilagi,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"Amazing experience, loved the story, sound and haptics.The little improvements in the game and new additions made the game a lot more enjoyable. After playing Iki Island I had to go for the Platinum...most beautiful open world game so far."
527,Vdll44,"Sep  5, 2021",10,"10/10 game and extension,people reviewbombing it for no reason.if you like AC you will love this game,its just superior to AC in all aspects. Gameplay is a masterpiece,storyline is great,side missions are really well done and the game is long. 10/10"
528,Bendiana,"Oct  5, 2021",10,Loved it! The story was amazing and the side missions had so much in it. The combat was nice and fluid.
529,CruDlux,"Aug 28, 2021",10,Ghost of Tsushima is one of my all time favorite games. The PS5 expansion raises the bar for this game. It beautiful and breath taking. Ghost will always have a special place in my heart.
530,Mannyr2d2,"Aug 23, 2021",10,There’s a lot of review bombing obviously haters and xbox fans. Get this game. It’s a masterpiece and it’s so beautiful and the gameplay is so fluid it’s insane. The new expansion is a great addition worth every penny.
531,Micj82,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"The Iki Island update is well worth the extra few quid. Stunning game, great experience."
532,HoodWitchKing,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"Sad that this is getting review bombed, this is legitimately my favorite single player experience of all time. The DLC is only 20 dollars and adds tons of cool new **** and an entire new region on the map to explore. The base game had 3 regions and cost 60 dollars, so paying $20 for a whole new region kind of adds up in that regard and personally I think it was very worth it (been playing it since it dropped)."
533,Szavwa,"Aug 23, 2021",10,"This is my 3rd playthrough of a single open world game which I’ve never done before… not even a second, but this title keeps me coming back. Without the DualSense & visual upgrades, I wouldn’t have picked this up for a third trip, but the game feels fresh & more immersive with the Japanese lip sync this time around. I’m enjoying everything about the upgrade. Well worth my money!"
534,L4AH4N,"Aug 23, 2021",10,The game is incredibly good and now it's in 4K 60fps and a dlc equivalent to a standalone game like RE2 Remake etc !!! This is marvellous ! Thanks Sucker Punch
535,mmason1331,"Aug 23, 2021",10,I paid the $20 to upgrade and add the expansion on PS4. This game is FANTASTIC. I've played it through twice regularly and just started a New Game+ with the expansion.If you are on PS4 or PS5 and have never played the game? It is still worth the $60 price point (or $70). It the last 10 years - this is a Top 5 game of mine.
536,Mujtaba0,"Aug 23, 2021",9,Very good and very beautiful 
537,Charlie001,"Aug 23, 2021",10,The Dualsense support only makes this game a 10/10. The game looks so damn amazing with 4k and 60 FPS. The story so far is so damn amazing.Learning more about Jim pass and his dad I just love it. You can also pet so many Animals like cats and foxes like who doesn't love that? Anyway this is a 10/10 and I would recommend you to buy it and try it out on yourself you won't regret it.

615,old_school_game,"Sep  2, 2021",10,"Ghost of Tsushima ""Directors Cut"" is clearly the most complete experience of Jin Sakai's journey. Overall the extra content really could be considered just a DLC for the game however the base game includes features that were unavailable in the original release. For instance the Directors Cut includes Japanese lip-sync which is 1:1 with the Japanese localization. Originally this wasn't available. As well features such as real-time Cinematics, target lock, along with repayable content in addition to the optimized version of the game for the PS5. For me personally the real value is the addition to Jin's back story which is peppered through Iki-Island. We learn more about Jin's Father as well as some new story elements about his Mother. I felt that the updated version of the game allowed for a more complete ""Hero's Journey"" of the game and allowed me to experience more of the Ghost and his world which is in my opinion a good thing."

645,Haeabi,"Sep 16, 2021",10,"This is one of the best game that I ever played, engaging story, excellent gameplay, and awesome graphics. Not sure why some user rate it poor, but I think this is must buy if you like action rpg game"
646,Sungodra16,"Sep 17, 2021",7,"Same lod, same textures, same broken animations, but you get vibrating controller for 10 dollars. Ghost of Tsushima has always seemed dull to me but it was at least enjoyable but 10 dollars for basic upgrades is a scam. Sony needs to do better"
647,MejorGian,"Sep 20, 2021",10,Eins der besten Spiele die ich gespielt habe!!!Bin Gamer schon seit über 20 Jahren und muss sagen das bei Ghost of Tsushima einfach alles passt.Positiv:- Super Story - fantastischer Soundtrack- Gute deutsche synchro- eins der besten Kampfsystem- fantastische Grafik und umfangreiche    NebenquestsNegativ:- eine Quest am Anfang war verbuggt- KI teils sehr dumm
648,CapiToon,"Sep 21, 2021",8,"En realidad es una buna oportunidad para las personas que no lo compraron al momento de su lanzamiento además de que aprovecha ben el nuevo mando del ps5, obviamente no tiene graficas nextgen pues originalmente fue creado para ps4, pero este upgrade ayuda. Tiene algunos bugs pero son mínimos, los FPS se sienten estables pocas veces llegan a caer de los 60"
649,MetaReviewer0,"Sep 21, 2021",8,"If you like Ghost of Tsushima you will like Ghost of Tsushima Directors Cut because it’s just more of the same, with a new vibrant island, new enemies and new abilities. More of the same doesn’t mean bad because Ghost is an excellent game and the new content give you a reason to return to the game after completing the main game. While the story on Iki Island isn’t the greatest thing in the world, I do think if you liked the base game and want more, you should definitely buy the $20 upgrade."
650,fadz13,"Sep 28, 2021",10,"SuckerPunch Productions took a great game and made it so much better with the Iki Island expansion, better Legends MP, better sound, use of SSD, use of 3D Audio. This game is one of the best-looking games ever!"
651,captainroger6,"Oct 11, 2021",10,"I wasn’t happy about how the director’s cut charged me for the upgrade, but I am willing to pay the extra to support a masterpiece like this. The stunning scenery and the elegant combat make this game a must-play for every next-gen player. 60 FPS does make everything smoother, and I truly enjoyed my new game + playthrough."
