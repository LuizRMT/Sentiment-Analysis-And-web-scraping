1,firsthere,"Nov 13, 2020",4,"They could have done so much more with this, sadly it has hardly any memorable boss fights, best thing this game has is costumes, but i'm not buying spider-man game to look at costumes. I want actual content."
2,Digger311,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"Unbelievably boring and short. The main story is 5.5 hours and half of it is filler content. Save your money, this game is not at all worth it."
3,imspeechless,"Nov 13, 2020",3,"They not only ruined Peter Parker's face, they also managed to make this game super boring."
4,alexsno,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"really short, which i normally wouldn't care about but its expensive for being this short."
5,imbetterthanu,"Nov 13, 2020",3,"I prefer 2018 spider-man to this honestly. It's just same city with some snow, boss fights are awful by the way. Not trying to hate, i'm just honest."
6,evyatar,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"they just not pot a full effort in this game, not a good building of characters, boring story. and why all the politics everywhere, let people play quietly"
7,MunirKillerX,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"Está llenísimo de bugs , no cargan texturas y está crasheando mi nueva ps5. Me ha decepcionado este juego, con la ilución que tenía."
8,DefinetheLine,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"New Peter Parker looks awful, i refuse to support this series further unless they change it back or at least make it optional. This one was just short dlc, very disappointing."
9,youxN,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"Extremely short and boring game. It has about 7-8 hrs. of gameplay and 60-70% is boooring non-plot missions where you killing billions enemies from last Spider-Man game. I was hoping for a lot of new bosses and interesting enemies. In this game I was repeatedly fighting Rhino and enemies from last game and only at the end of gameplay I got two not really interesting bosses and one type of new enemies. I don't understand why is this game sells itself by fullprice. It more looks like a DLC with global HUD update. I would recommend buy THIS only if you're a really big fan of first Marvel's Spider-Man game. Don't buy it by fullprice, wait for like 60% discount. I was waiting for an interesting story, at least 4 new bosses, puzzles, couple of new type of enemies but got disappointed. Not recommend at all. Better save your money."

11,fly78,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"That's a no thank you from me, Not enough bosses (there's hardly any), not enough meaningful content and oh yea they completely ruined peter parker's look, so there's that too."
12,Locop,"Nov 13, 2020",1,the face of the new peter parker is horrible it does not make you want to play a game that the developers do not care about the fans very apart that it is very short and boring ...
13,Emo_lord,"Nov 14, 2020",0,Только из за нового лица Питера. Верните Бубняка!
14,Anasi,"Nov 14, 2020",2,"I thought this was a game about spiderman and his super villains. But in fact, the game is about how black people can also be evil, kind, strong, smart .. I am not against Moralez, but enough to join politics"
15,Spideverselop,"Nov 13, 2020",0,the change of face spoils the experience you do not know who that boy is and there is not the same empathy with the character ...
16,Fantastic75,"Nov 13, 2020",2,"Can someone PLEASE explain why this game is so short? Hardly any bosses. I was waiting for at least 10 new villains, but it's clear that they keep them all for Spider-man 2. So they basically had you fight Rhino about million times in this one. Wait for sale if anything."
17,Namikaze_D,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"С каждой новой частью всегда хочется чего-то нового или как минимум улучшение того, что было, но к сожалению разработчики просто лениво пошли по тому же пути, что и шли, просто скопировав все тоже что и было раньше. По сути те же яйца только в профиль. К сожалению, когда в первой части большинство механик и идей смотрелись хорошо, здесь это смотрится бредово и вторично. Сюжет. Не сказать, чтобы в первой части сюжет был сильной частью игры, но здесь это полная посредственность. Я понимаю в супергероике сюжет никогда не был важной частью и поэтому над ним как я понял особо никогда не работали, но все же настолько слабой истории я не ждал. В первой части первый враг (Негатив) по сути был единственным врагом первые пол игры и он тоже был не особо интересен, но в этой части антагонист просто пробивает дно своей полной унылостью и неинтересностью. Про характеры персонажей даже говорить смешно. О геймплее особо сказать нечего. Он пусти абсолютно тот же что и в первой части за исключением пары нововведений, которые на мой взгляд смотрятся довольно бредово. Сайдквесты все та же рутина как и в прошлой части. Они из разряда подай-принеси. Я ждал, что над ними поработают после первой части. При всем при этом игра очень короткая. Это скорее большое длс чем полноценная игра. Ведьмак 3 не даст соврать) Злодеев по сути нет, а сражаться с ними всегда было весело. Антогонист апогей уныния. Очень мало шуток, а те что есть совершенно не смешные. Паркер постоянно шутил и большинство шуток были на все деньги. Отдельно хотелось бы поговорить о главном герое. В первой части Майлз был невероятно унылым персонажем, который не давал истории абсолютно ничего и убери его из сюжета по сути ничего не изменится. До конца игры было не понятно зачем он там) В конце игры все встало на свои места. Стало понятно, что, зачем и почему. К сожалению во второй части чуда не случилось. Персонаж как был унылым и неинтересным, таким он им и остался. Паркера в игре почти нет, но все же об его метаморфозах упомянуть стоит. Возможно, я привык к прошлому актеру, но на мой взгляд новый совершенно не смотрится. Не стоило им ничего менять и вводить нового героя. Понимаю сейчас такое время, что приходится пропихивать подобное, но все же. Паркера всегда любили и зачем его менять я не понимаю. Так же не обошлось без подлизывание всем кому можно подлизать. Много политики и тому подобного. Очень жаль. На это не очень приятно смотреть. Игры перестают быть играми( В общем игра полное разочарование."
18,Gamecritic356,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"Too short. Barely any boss battles. Too many “shock this thing, shock that thing” gameplay uninspired minus some new animations. Just disappointment all around"
19,enter77,"Nov 13, 2020",3,"They could have done so much with this game and they did absolutely nothing. No memorable boss battle, hardly any bosses to care about. It's a no from me."
20,AceAscendus,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"New Peter looks like garbage, bring back old Peter, why did you change his face??? The raytracing and lighting changes look worse than PS4 version. Also, Miles sucks, he is boring. What an epic failure of a game."
21,GalletaSuprema,"Nov 13, 2020",0,"the worst game ever, bad graphics, looks like a dlc, 6 hours of game, really disaponting and disgusting, terrible, ugly, awful"
22,El5anto,"Nov 15, 2020",0,"This is not by far a full game, it's less entertaining and probably shorter than the ps4 game DLCs, the story is ridiculously predictable is definitely intended for way too young audiences.. As a Latino I despise using the terms SJW or PC but the forced ""integration"" is so in your face it hurts your brain. I was hoping for the worst and sadly I got exactly what I expected... Too bad for the disservice it does to the ps4 (including the unnecessary Peter face change). Avoid if possible and just buy after it's 80% discounted, if at all..."

26,Hossein717,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Absolutely amazing, it’s like playing a freakin movie! I think it’s actually better than the 2018 Spider-Man, and that one was amazing!"
27,HaloFever,"Jan 17, 2021",10,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales does whatever a Spider can. Literally. You swing around punching people and using gadgets just like in the first game. I might criticize this game for being too similar. Certainly in a head to head competition, the first game is going to win. It’s simply bigger and also the first time you see this version of New York. Yet Miles Morales is a fantastic game in its own right and for that it deserves credit. Even if this were an expansion, it would be a fantastic expansion and I would score it the same. Let’s address the rhinoceros in the room. This game is short but not too short. My playthrough took 17 hours. I liked that the game was short. The game does not hit you with upgrade paths that require a lot of grinding or an insane amount of collectibles needed for a new costumes or a Platinum trophy. Every minute of my 17 hours was spectacular. The magic of the game is the gameplay. All of the cutscenes, performances, and story elements are nice. I’ve played games with great cutscenes and terrible gameplay and one of them is The Order: 1886. I’ve also played games with great gameplay and terrible cutscenes and one of those is Just Cause 2. Either one will only take a game so far. Combine both and you have a legend. If you have played the first Spider-Man game, you know what to expect with Miles Morales. A short thought on Miles Morales, his powers fit right into a video game because they are OP as hell. Think about it. He has all of the original Spider-Man’s powers and Spider-Man already has a complete power set. On top of all that, Miles Morales can become invisible and shoot out electricity. This means that in a tough fight, Miles can go invisible like a get of danger free card. Or he can use his electricity powers like a win button. Writing for Miles Morales must be a chore, because like with Super-Man in the DC Universe, Miles is assured of winning so long as he uses all of his powers. In a video game, though, going invisible and hitting bad guys with electricity is plainly and simply fun to do. Miles fits right in. The last time I played a stand-alone expansion like this was Infamous: First Light. I believe that expansion was made by the same studio. The difference between First Light and Miles Morales is that I downloaded First Light for free with PS+ and I paid $50 for Miles Morales. I will stay out of the debate of weather Miles Morales is a good deal. I usually wait a year or more to buy games and in fact I bought the complete Spider-Man game a year late for a mere $25. Sony is certainly making a case for the value of Miles Morales by including a PS5 version of first Spider-Man game as a $20 add-on. Best not to get into the value debate. A good game is good regardless of playtime and price. Last thought on this game: I want more of it. Keeping my fingers crossed for a Spider-Man 2 with two spider-men."
28,cadeee,"Apr  8, 2021",0,It’s not a game. It’s a political advertising.我是來玩遊戲的，誰管你的政治主張是什麼？遊戲沒有資格強行灌輸你的政治觀念給玩家。非常糟糕的遊戲
29,eboke,"Feb  2, 2021",10,"Absolutely amazing, it’s like playing a freakin movie! I think it’s actually better than the 2018 Spider-Man, and that one was amazing! Don't listen the haters."
30,SplitMind,"Jun 23, 2021",8,"Miles Morales has some big shoes to fill in the follow up to 2018’s satisfying delivery of Spider-Man at last on modern consoles. The good news is that we really do get Spider-Man: Miles Morales, possibly the best of both worlds. The graphics are eye-catching. Webswinging through the city and scaling buildings allows for some excellent panoramic views. The game also suffers from what is looking like a next-gen issue, in that we must make a choice between resolution and framerate. For me, framerate wins all the time. I spent a good 90% of my time in performance modes and the difference was amazing for me. The smoothness and fluidity of movement on-screen makes the game all the more enjoyable. The only thing I would like to have seen is more variety in the suits. The game is quite ‘forward-looking’, as I’m guessing these suits are mostly from the comics as I didn’t recognize most of them. Then we have the gameplay, where MM has a particular focus and a solid foundation from the first Spider-Man game. What I really liked here is that they were able to build upon this to avoid repetition and rehashing the same 2018 mechanics. At first the Venom mechanics seemed annoying to me, but with practice they prove their usefulness and establish MM with his own identity. It’s quite enjoyable having the powers to smash through heavy shields, for example. Let’s not forget the key component of any Spider-Man game – webswinging.I don’t think we’ve ever seen better mechanics for this until 2018, but now MM is able to build on this also to make it very responsive and definitely the best webswinging I think you’ll ever experience. The biggest downside of the gameplay is that the repetition is still there. They tried to amp-up the mission varieties and include a nifty app for accessing them, but you still get a lot of the dreaded Ubisoft mentality where the map can be littered with things to collect and mini-missions that can get tedious. Fortunately, these are largely optional and doing them sparingly does provide a break from the main story. I think most people will be glad to know Mary Jane’s stealth missions are absent here, and the camouflage mechanic made stealth a whole lot more appealing, whereas the last game made just want to crash in and maul everyone to be faster. Lastly, the story. MM attempts to convey a very modern story; the characters are diverse and not necessarily white American-born. More importantly, the story conveys well the sense of community that the first game touched upon with the homeless shelter. MM tends to be a very likeable if unremarkable character. I was quite surprised that only Rhino makes an appearance from the OG bad guys, but this also makes sense to avoid repetition. Really, the game and plot have their own identity to the point that everyone’s presence made sense, so I don’t think any mainstream villains would have added much to the story. Overall, Spider-Man: Miles Morales worried me that it would be more like a DLC than a standalone game, but it’s not and I really enjoyed the game. There is some repetition and occasional monotony when the pacing slows, but this seemed to add to the whole experience. It’s not the longest game, but that’s not a bad thing to me. While it borders on cliché, Miles Morales is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man videogame catalogue and I am very intrigued to see where they go from here."
31,Symbioted,"Nov 18, 2020",9,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a heavy improvement upon its predecessor (Spider-Man PS4). Combat, web-slinging, and air tricks make a return, but they have been fixed and improved upon to fit a smoother experience. As a huge Spider-Man fan myself, the story is a satisfying experience and will leave a good taste in your mouth. My only issue is the price, considering the game has very little to offer, $50 is too much. I beat the game in three days and earned the platinum trophy, but I see myself replaying this more in the future."
32,jmason86,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"Whoa. Every bit as good as the original and maybe even a little bit better. Absolutely loved it. Perfect marks on every count. They took an amazing engine with some of the most amazing graphics I've ever seen (and an exceptional photo mode) and built yet another great story inside of it. The music when swinging was actually better than the original, imo. Spiderman has long been my favorite superhero and this game was an absolute joy to experience."
33,Instable,"Jan  3, 2021",8,"First of all it s really gready from Sony to charge us with a full price for a dlc. Seriously, it would be a perfect DLC, but not a stand along game."
34,Bigmakin,"Dec 22, 2020",0,I don't like the BLM conception in real life and I don't like when developers are inspiring this in the game which I bought on my money. Put your propaganda outside of the game next time
35,luigg,"Nov 28, 2020",3,"De verdad como puede tener 85 el juego después de ver que esta plagado de buga, al principio que lo jugué fue gracioso pero después de que vi que el muñeco atravesó el suelo y tuve que reiniciar mi ps5 la verdad se vuelve molesto y una prueba más de que la prensa esta comprada"
36,Ert0426,"Jul 21, 2021",9,"A definite improvement over the original. The combat is greatly improved, and the new Venom powers are incredibly fun and satisfying to use. The story has the same charm and wit as the previous one. However, I do have one major issue with this game: it's length. It is around only half of the original game's in length. However, that issue is definitely not a deal breaker, as this game is still amazing. Or should i say ""spectacular""? (yeah that one probably went a bit too far)"
37,fmathez,"Dec 31, 2020",8,"Réalisation impeccable, belle prouesse technique et jouabilite au top comme dans le premier épisode. Je note juste un bémol pour le scénario parfois un peu nian nian type telenovela"
38,Hmody10087,"Dec  8, 2020",9,One of the best game to open next gen the ending was crazy i'm happy that we can see miles and Peter swinging together at the end

40,Lukitass,"Jan 28, 2021",9,"The best narrative for such a short game and that in turn, is an expansion. Outstanding graphics and best console's RT, with a wide head start."
41,princey2001,"Jan 27, 2021",9,Once again Insomniac takes it to a new level in gaming. Shorter then spider man but a great story for a new hero.  SCORE 88/100
42,l-vShadow,"Jan 27, 2021",10,"The games is short but HOLY did Insomniac delivered. Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay and a good story!"
43,jj98891,"Jan 29, 2021",10,Awesome game. Love the addition of Venom Attacks and the Camouflage. Love the characters. Love the visuals. Just awesome!
44,tomi_ly,"Nov 20, 2020",5,"This game was so hyped, I was hyped. But the game isn't that good either. It's very very short. I finished it under 5 hours. The story isn't as good as the first one as well, and it's really boring, And not worth the 50 dollars. If you played the first Spider-Man PS4, it's basically the same thing but less abillities as Miles. I will say the music is great. But the game isn't. DON'T BUY THIS GAME. BUY SOMETHING ELSE."
45,Swansea-Jack,"Dec  4, 2020",9,"Even with this game being small, it incapacitated everything insomnia stands for. They make an amazing single player, story driven game that is with the times, I absolutely loved the nod to Black Lives Matter in a mural which was painted by a deaf girl that her and miles use accusatory sign Lagina he to communicate.All this makes up for the very short story but has left me craving more and cannot wait!"
46,CynicalBlade,"Dec 13, 2020",0,Although it has a very short story (7 hours of gameplay) I think its a pretty good game since there are many side missions overall I really enjoyed this game but I would like there to be a DLC since I found the story to be short Combat is a key item in Spider-Man: Miles Moralesthere are many combat mechanics to learn and it really is just amazing Overall 10/10
47,T88DPG,"Dec 14, 2020",9,"Only thing I do have about this game is that it is a lot shorter than the remastered game. Having said that, I absolutely loved it. It’s so smooth and a lot more enjoyable with the extra powers that miles has! Defiantly recommend!"
48,OooooooookH,"Dec 19, 2020",9,"Loved the game. The story, graphics, and overall world of this game is great. While sure it's short and at times predictable, I enjoyed it. Quite a bit."
49,XSgtDX,"Jan 19, 2021",10,"Greatest launch game on the platform.  This is a console exclusive, so numbers may be effected by the number of consoles sold.  A large glut of consoles are still not in users hands but are being hordes by scalpers."
50,Arshia_salmania,"Jan 29, 2021",10,Perfect game 
51,adamgamage,"May  1, 2021",10,Honestly so good. I can't wait for the full sequel from Insomniac. Absolutely brilliant.
52,RaptorNemesis,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"Le seul jeu next gen en open world 4k 60fps et RT. Un super complément du Spider-man 1, On est dans la next gen."
53,TheOldHunter,"Feb  9, 2021",10,Graphic is mindblowing with ray tracing and 4k.. gameplay is great.. story is great. Miles Morales is great character.. :)
54,Lubos10,"Aug 19, 2021",3,"Main story is just 50% of the gameplay, then you spend so much time with the stupid staff to extend main story for at least 12hours for over 60$. Also doesn’t support any feautures of dualsence."
55,VedatoreC,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"Wonderful narative and fluid gameplay, in addition to new features like ray tracing and near-instant loading times make this game a masterpiece."
56,datoneguy246,"May 13, 2021",6,"The Spider-Man formula established in the previous game is still present here, and it's great! This game makes some alterations to that formula that I wasn't entirely on-board with. For starters, it removes a lot of Spider-Man's gadgets in favor of Miles' venom power, which gives the player less flexibility in combat.  However none of these changes are substantial enough to make the game bad. What I find baffling about this game is that it isn't really a sequel to the original game. If anything, this is DLC disguised as a new game. The main campaign is so incredibly short and you can finish it in about 5 hours. The game lacks substance, and it's pretty disappointing. Not worth it's price."
57,Kemo_2003,"Sep  8, 2021",9,"Spider-man 2018 is one of my favourite games of all time and when they announced about a spin-off version as Miles Morales , my excitement was through the roof and now after finishing the game a couple of days ago, let me tell you that it was worth the hype! The story, combat, and characters by themselves makes it worth the money although its content are reduced compared to spider-man 2018, I still found my self a lot of things to do like the side quests are really important and actually relevant to the story as well as the mini challenges and collections they offer in the game which are all related as well. Its performance are amazing with smooth and stable framerate and beautiful graphics which Is made better with the ps5. Overall this is an exciting and fresh story as Miles Morales which you should absolutely play it and you will love it even more if you played spider-man 2018. For me, I would have given it a 10 but the shorter story and overall content makes spider-man 2018 10/10 since Miles Morales is more of a huge dlc if you well compared to it, so if you feel hesitant feel free to wait for a sale but I assure you its worth the full price as its completely different side in the Insomniac spider-man universe!! I hope you enjoyed this review"
58,VGConsoleAPE,"Sep 27, 2021",10,"Another incredible launch title for Jim Ryan and company. Miles Morales is a fantastic follow up to Insomniac's terrific Spider-Man game on PS4. This concise storyline is sure to make even the most cold hearted gamer feel some serious emotion! Not only that, Mile's excellent venom powers only further build on the excellent and fun gameplay. Another win for Jim!"
59,sethguyhill,"Nov 23, 2020",0,"Short. Hey woke SIE... you forgot to include an Asian child transvestite spider-man. So, unfortunately  I have to give you a poor score. Reference TLOU2 for an exemplary implementation of wokeness. To clarify, you don't need to have all races and sexual preferences in your games to get a good score, but you do need enough to show that you are truly and completely woke. Also, you can gain points by adding simple things like: the women need to be more manly than the men, or sending pregnant women to war, or a homo sex scene is a total win, and absolutely expect to earn HUGE points if your main character calls a middle age white man a bigot."

62,commander_L,"Nov 15, 2020",1,"During 4 hours of gameplay hand multiple bugs. Game crashed 3 times with fatal errors. And after 4 hours and 50%(sic!) completion it's locked in unplayable state. Savefile has also became corrupted. Moderator at insomniac discord server said to ""be grateful that they have even released another game"". Said they a looking into it but there has been no mentions on any social media about a patch or fix or even the acknowledgment of fact that the problems exist. About the game, (or at least of what was available before the game locked) there not much good to say. Environment design is good but that's about it. Story is subpar. No new interesting bosses. Characters are boring and some minor ones are completely unnecessary. Gameplay is the same as in the original. Since content is mostly a rehash of the original game, at 50$ it's basically a buggy overpriced DLC. A real shame, since original was so good."

66,HiimKai,"Nov 30, 2020",8,"Spiderman MM is definitely a great superhero game and it does a lot to improve on its predecessor in terms of combat and traversal. It never really gets old to web-sling through an accurate depiction of New-York City. The story and gameplay was enjoyable enough for me to at least want a gameplay session in everyday. The story had likeable characters (shoutout OG Spiderman specifically) and not one really stood out to me as a bad character. Graphics are amazing and as expected from a launch title for the PS5. However, the game did miss two marks for me. One big gripe I had with the game was the overall playtime. If we disregard side missions and the open-world activities, we are looking at 6-7 hours of main mission playtime, which bothered me for a triple A open-world $100 (AUS) game. It also does not help that the first game doubles this playtime. Another issue I could not look over was the lack of memorable boss fights, its hard not to compare it to the first game but, the first game did have many good boss fights against OG Spiderman’s iconic villains. This game did not even reach to half of that. Although, the final boss was a banger. Overall, it is pretty difficult to justify paying full price for this game, but I can say that it is game that should not be looked over, especially if you were a fan of the first game. If you want to wait for a sale, thats cool, if you want to buy asap with your brand new PS5,  Id say thats cool too. (Peter Parker’s new face aint that bad lol.)"
67,ShaddowMaann,"Dec  1, 2020",6,Honestly this game isn't that good everyone is just saying its good because of BLM and the activism in it. Its a wanna be of the original the game took like 8 hours to beat and 10 to 100% the game. They didn't even really go indepth on miles powers he has a different skill set than peter and they should have really gone more indepth with it. The villain and love interest are both predictable and they tried so hard to make the villain good when they weren't. They had good stories they could have picked from but really just made a bland one. Game isnt terrible but not as amazing as everyone says
68,Malleus_9,"Dec  1, 2020",0,"Im giving this game a zero because of the SJW tones and political bs littered throughout. I play video games to escape reality and have fun, socio-politics have no place in video games. I’m sorry but go woke go broke."

75,KUNMB11,"Nov 17, 2020",6,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (PS5) (+) Ultimate graphics and a technical showcase for the PS5(+) Spectacular traversal gameplay(+) Amazing and enjoyable combat mechanics (-) Mission linearity doesn't justify the open world(-) Predictable and seemingly rushed narrative due to too many characters placed within a short timeframe(-) Nothing innovative, rather a decent entry into a new generation of console (3/5) - Above Average - Recommended at $29.99"
76,tinoquinho,"Nov 16, 2020",8,"the story of the game is very good, the characters are very well explored, the boss fight is very cool, the costumes are very beautiful (with the exception of one).  i had only a few problems of frame ratting at the end and sometimes it took time to render some things. the only problems for me were, the plot twist of the villain was very obvious and the game is too short, so maybe it is not very nice to catch the game for 60 dollars (250 reais). that's my criticism of the game."

78,TurboChards,"Nov 15, 2020",3,"For such a hyped title, and a perceived game that should be better than its predecessor, the hype was not worth the wait.  I completed the campaign on “Amazing” difficulty, 3rd highest, in 4hrs 31min and I wasn’t even rushing.  This game did not innovate, and truly seems like it was a copy and paste.  This game proved to be correctly labeled as DLC by the non-fanboys.The game runs decent on the PS5 outside of the numerous obvious frame rate drops and pop in.  I tested this on my PS4 Pro and it looked only slightly different than the PS5 version.  The “Ray tracing” that is being touted by the fanboy community is underwhelming.  Projection on buildings is of low resolution.  Overall this is a very over-hyped, over-priced dlc!"
79,mmarkk3,"Jan 24, 2021",8,"Only major gripe is that it's much shorter in length than its predecessor (Spider-Man PS4), but that said, this game is a marvel, no pun intended, and very well executed.

81,BadlyReviews,"Nov 16, 2020",8,"I loved this game. Although, the enemies were a bit boring considering we fought 2 of them in the last game (Roxxon, sort of and criminals) The boss fights were fun even though by the end of the game, if you played the first game you've fought Rhino 3 times. The end game, in short, is boring, there is not nearly enough things to do after the campaign, I hope the DLC improves on this issue.  It feels like Insomniac didn't put much effort into this game, in the first game there was over 40 suits, there is only 19 in Miles Morales, but good to them for giving the touchpad a use other than a map! Keep in mind anyone reading this, i played this game on the PS4, I cannot say anything about the PS5 version without playing it. I loved the abilities of Miles (Invisibility and Venom Power) giving me the fact you don't have to do boring MJ stealth missions."

I own PS4 and i owned MM game, which i refunded, and there's slightly difference but the game is same. Its same lenght, i beat it in 7-8 hours, very short for 60 euros and if you compare it to OG Spider Man from 2018 the game was 15 hours long. Boss fights. The only time when i enjoyed boss fights was against Prowler and Thinkerer, everything else was boring. Rhino, after Rhino after Rhino, what a letdown. The game itself is extremly buggy, most bugs that i encountered was when Miles becomes object ( fence, cloud etc.). What's else? They shanged Peter's face and not for good. I expected that before final launch Peter will look better, older according to his age 24, instead he looks like a kid from a Remaster to MM game. And devs promised and advertised that face will look good. There is one scene in particular. When DockOck shows his mechanichal arms old face model showed some emotion of excitement and wory, it had some expression. New face model have no such emotion or expression. He's constantly smiling. Speaking of Remaster you can't review it or give it a score anywhere cause devs won't let you. What a scummy move. So basicaly they don't give you and option to review it so i did it here. Guess they're affraid that ''hateful minority'' ( James Stevenson words) will how them what they think. Is there anything else you might ask? Well there is. The game is full of political propaganda, like BLM. I don't have anything against black people and i believe that ALL LIVES MATTER. But hey that's Sony, always destroying what it touches. Anyway, i don't recommend this game. It's to short, buy it only at discount if you get any."

88,JoeKane,"Nov 16, 2020",7,"Spider-Man Miles Morales is a fun experience but compared to the first Spider-Man game, I find Miles Morales lacks in some spots. First of all the game looks amazing (and I played it on ps4) its the same map as the first game but with snow everywhere and it feels really good to be swinging around New York City as Spider-Man again. The game has an interesting story and the characters are likable, but I find that even though it has the same map as the first one, I find there's not a whole lot of things to do. Like the first game, you can do small things around the map like enemy bases and finding items on the side of buildings, but it feels more like a boring chore than a fun challenge. I think the game should be longer and feature more enemies especially with the same amount of space as the first game. the game only focuses on one villain whereas in the first game you faced off against many classic Spider-Man bad guys. Also, I'm not gonna get into spoiler teritory but I find the ending is just a repeat of the first games ending. Overall I find Miles Morales is a good game in many ways but I just really wish they could have done more with the game by making me want to do more in the game."
89,Ruabadfsh2,"Dec 13, 2020",10,"Fantastic! While this game is not as long as the original game, i think it delivers a better, more concise package. Looks great and plays even better. Highly recommended."
90,nascent,"Dec  2, 2020",6,"miles morale review After loving and enjoying Spider-Man (2018) I was excited to play my PS5 Launch game Spider-Man: Mile Morales. From the momoent I fired it up, I was a little confused by the textures.  Lighting seemed decent, but textures looked lower quality than I expected.  I instantly went to youtibe and searched Miles morales ps5 vs ps4 and found some compatison videos showing graphical differences, and was horrified to see they were identical across 7 year old platforms. After playing a large amount for mile morales ultimate digitally  I was rally dissapinted that I was getting a ps4 quality game which I couldn't played without getting a ps5. Aside from that, mile morales is extremely similar to the previous Spiderman game.  Everything is very a cookie-cutter copy of the previous game, aside from ney work being the same, the enamies are blatant reskins of the same enemies of the previous game.  Very little seems new.Miles is obviously fairly similar being spiderman, but has a lot less gagdets.  The main difference is that Miles has camoflage.  Additionally the enemy difficulty seems harder than with the previous game, it takes a lot more punch to take down enemies (yet the boss attles seem much easier in this game).  I found the most enjoyable experience for me was just to turn the game into a stealth game and constantly be camoflage, and stealth takedown everyone. So aside froma graphically dissapointing reskin of Spider-Man (2018) with camgoflage, there's obvious a new story that revolves around Miles.  However for some reason this is very short, the story is much shorter than the previous game.  I hit 50% completed in a few hours.That being said, I really didn't find the story of the game that interesting.  The relationship with the uncle was the only thing I was somewhat intersted in, and it was very briefly told.  The mother character is barely in the game, the friend is a thinly developed character.  The lead girl is thinly developed.  The rest of the enemies get very little screen time.  Peter is obviously very barely in it (although i found the times he was present far more interesting the Miles, miles is a pretty 2 dimentional character).  The very ending was fairly redeeming though. I tried to space out the story missions to make the game last longer once i started to see how short it is, but there's very few side missions.  There's only a dozen or so of each collectable, so they're fast to collect.  The crime around the city seems to be sparce, many districts have no crime or side quests, andd the ones that do only seems to trigger crime events very rarely.The main new side-mission format is the in-game spiderman app.  However this only provides about a dozen little missions that are very quick to complete (~5 minutes per quest). There's also a sort of series of side quests to identify and record sounds around the city to make music.  Whilst this is a fairly unique idea, I found it really out of place and incredibly dull.  Also again, quick to complete. Another thing to mention is the sound.  I found the music pretty dull, I like hip-hop style music, but this was quite bland, and missed the soundtrack from the previous game.  Also the radio/podcasts were far fewer in this game than the previous, and the new primary podcast host Danicka was very uninteresting. I know there's a lot of online buzz about how buggy the game is and how miles gets repalced by random objects such as street lamps and trash bins etc.  I didn't experience this but maybe that particular bug has been fixed now.I have however had a cuple of minor crashes, and one big one that completey locked up my game, and eventually hut down the entire ps5.  After a while struggling to get the ps5 to turn on again, and me thinking it was dead forever, it came back up.  This funnily enough occured during the final battle of the game.nasty crash. Honestly, Spider-man: Miles Morales felt more like a dlc than a full game.  The game I just played previous to this was Far Cry: Primal.  Which coincidentally was originally going to be a DLC for Far Cry 4, until Ubisoft decided to turn it into a standalone game.  Whilst I'm not the biggest fan of Far Cry: Primal.  I spent about 30 hours to complete it.  Spider-man: Miles Morales took me about 12, which included unlocking everything. (I choose not to do New Game plus as the game wasn't that enjoyable the first time around)."
91,freemanlouis,"Nov 28, 2020",10,"Every moment fun and exciting.  Collecting and powering up suits, takedown animations, the fun combat from the previous game and a easy interface for all the side missions were my favorite highlights of the game.

101,iMustang,"Jun  7, 2021",9,"When I first began playing Miles Morales, I was worried I would not like the game at all. It was very clear from the beginning this game was intended as an standalone DLC-Game (ex. Infamous First Light, Uncharted Lost Legacy, etc), and with how heavily the assets were reused from the world map even down to certain enemy encounters I was shaking my head very early on. However, to write this off as simply a 'glorified DLC' would be a cruel injustice to a very fun game. Spider-Man Miles Morales is a delightful journey of a young man finding his walk in life, deciding what's write and wrong along the way. While the plot of the game is easily predictable, the character development he goes through during the events of the story matter so much more. This game finally made me like Miles as a character, because through playing this story I was able to find out not only what his character was like, but what he wanted it to be. Along the way you meet all sorts of delightful characters like his mother, uncle, and even an adorable deaf girl who really round out the city of Harlem. Gameplay wise it's more or less the same as the original, but Miles does play very differently than Peter which makes fighting a whole new experience (and he doesn't quite have Pete's finesse, so even web slinging is delightful). And of course in truest Insomniac fashion, the game is just as flashy and fun to watch as it is to play during their wonderful cutscenes complimented by excellent actors. Oh! And music too! I may not be much for rap, but they nailed it for me in this game. I can continue to sing this game's praises, but I have to voice a couple more grievances as well. While I think everyone who enjoyed the first game should play this game, I cannot suggest paying more than 20 dollars for it, certainly no more than 30. While I do believe the effort put into this game justifies the standalone release, the amount of reused assets do not justify a 50 dollar price tag, especially with the game being so short at less than 6 hours if you're not trying for a complete file. What's more, if you ARE a completionist, they force you into a NG+ to unlock things and get the Platinum trophy. I love Insomniac to death but I think there were a few missteps here, especially with their marketing. Honestly though, while I complain about some of these things, they simply do not take away from an absolutely amazing game. It is an absolute thrill from beginning to end and is filled with so many fun characters and good feels it makes everything else seem superficial. In spite of my problems with pricing models and reused assets, I still cannot see this game as anything less than an amazing game. If you enjoyed the original, do continue on this journey because it is an incredible one. Just... as affordably as possible."
102,Ed24,"Apr 11, 2021",6,"This is more of a long DLC and quite shameful to be at a full game price. If we're comparing it to Spiderman, sadly, it doesn't come close. Gameplay, missions, story, etc all fall short in everyway. Wait until it's at a DLC price to buy. In saying that, it's still a Spiderman game and gives you a refreshing taste of it."
103,ExoDeploy,"Aug 16, 2021",8,"Excellent game, but short indeed (8-10 hours). The story is good, the fight scenes are exceptional, the sense of freedom going here and there is good (although there isn't much to do besides side quests).  It does show what the PS5 is capable of, and for being one of the first games doing so, it deserves a solid 8 (again, despite a very short storyline)."

Feels very wrong, thats not what superheros are for or what is morally right for the world.... Superheros are suppose to be everyone's hero, not a certain race's hero... Guess because I am white I am not allowed to be a fan according to the game ... I want Peter Parker back with his story and world. That way I can feel like I am allowed to like Spiderman again and can experience a large diverse of people. White, black, latino, asian, etc. Just like the real world with real morals...

111,Xolt3c,"Nov 29, 2020",6,"The story was way too short for the price. This kind of leads to the narrative falling flat, adding to the boring villain and characters that make the beats of the story also flat too. The controls could fight you at times, for example you can web zip to everything; plus, the cameras can feel shaky that can make the experience even worse. The frame rate is bad, it especially drops in crowded areas too. Some redeemable qualities is that the side missions are better. The soundtrack is great. The Web Slinging is still fun."

117,OnlyOneHere,"Nov 14, 2020",0,"This game is too expensive for a short game. The greedy developers are charging $50 for a story DLC that would normally cost $15-30. The campaign is extremely short and only lasts for like 6 hours. Barely and boss battles and almost half of the game is cutscenes, to the point that it is basically a movie. The story is trash. Peter Parker looks younger than Miles Morales now, despite being his mentor. The gameplay is exactly the same as Spider-Man PS4. When I pay $50 for a new game and buy a new console, I expect improvements. It recycles the same map as the last game. The physics are still a joke. The web slinging is still animation-based rather than physics-based. Miles Morales is a boring character. He is just another Peter Parker with his annoying and corny dialogue. It still has those same Saints Row 4 running animations on walls. It make the game feel like a PS3 game which is extremely outdated for a PS5 game. The side content is boring in this game. There is nothing worth doing in the open world. Is there any multiplayer to make up for the boring open world? Oh that's right, there is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is not a reason to touch this game again. Charging $50 for a game with no replay value is a cashgrab. I don't recommend this overpriced trash at all. Just wait until it is free on PS Plus."

И очень жаль, что люди подобное с радостью скушали.Можно было бы поставить оценку еще ниже, но все таки core-механики у игры остались все те же что у великолепного оригинала, а значит опуститься хуже было бы довольно сложно.

131,Jo-Clout,"Nov 17, 2020",10,"I knew Insomniac would deliver an amazing game/Spider-Man(Men) experience once again. But man did they ever delivered wayyyy over my expectations. The swinging is so much better (the bar was already pretty high from the previous game), the fighting is perfect and exciting, the story is compelling, the graphics are stunning... I mean, what is there not to love? Plus a kickass soundtrack!!"
132,William2500,"Nov 15, 2020",10,Muy buen juego se mantiene la esencia del anterior juego el balanceo mejorado historia excelente
133,Samplast,"Nov 13, 2020",10,The game is a 8..but i scored it 10 because its much better than the first..peter in the first game was dull and boring.miles is so much better.The music is much better...the city and building is so much better..in the first spider man they were empty and the building were like boxes .The fighting is the same.but the animation is much better .u feel like a real spiderman .
134,EfrainGH,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"Muy buenos graficos, banda sonora, historia corta pero concisa, me parece un buen Spin-Off para la saga. Esperando con ansias Spider-Man 2."
135,Cacasecaxxx,"Nov 14, 2020",9,"Este juego es tan bueno o mas que el primero, vale la pena jugarlo en la PS5 por la sensación de la vibración y los gatillos ademas del 4k y el raytracing que son fantásticos, aunque si prefieres puedes jugar a un modo de 60fps extremadamente bueno, la historia esta bastante bien aunque peca de corta y los tiempos de carga son de 5 milesimas de sengundo (menos de un segundo) lo cual es increíble.La jugabilidad es fantástica y las misiones secundarias divertidas.Por favor no os fiéis de las reviews con menos de 5, son fans toxicos de otra compañía, me parece ridículo que tengan que hacer review bombing para sentirse bien consigo mismos, una vergüenza que metacritic acepte este tipo de comportamientos."
136,LukasBoii,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Masterpiece. Enjoyed it as much as I did with the 2018 Spider-Man. I really don't care that it's short, since I love it anyway. Its also funny how I'm seeing all of these Xbox fanboys, who are triggered because they don't have any games at launch, review bombing this game and Demons Souls."
137,Nelljax,"Nov 13, 2020",10,I'll start off by saying this game is pretty short but they made that very clear prior to release. However it takes most (if not all) of the basic combat mechanics of the original Spider-Man ps4 and adds to them in unique and exciting ways. I'm able to combo new moves together using venom attacks and attacks I learned in the original.As a huge Spider-Man fan I'm very happy to see how they made Miles and Peter feel distinctly different in their combat and traversal.I truly feel like I was rooting for Miles to find his feet and become Bay's new official co-spiderman
138,Tunisaiyan,"Nov 14, 2020",10,The game is excellent it look stuning on the PS5 especially with the raytracing enable

144,Marcz3ra,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Think of it as a more focused sequel instead, as that’s what it actually feels like. It’s free of story bloat, and the gameplay has most definitely been expanded upon and improved. Plus, since when has an expansion looked so much nicer than the game it’s building upon? This is a timely release that demonstrates the power of the PS5 with style, and if you aren’t picking it up alongside your console, you’re simply doing things wrong."

147,Zach0701,"Nov 15, 2020",9,They did a really good job with the animations specific to this Spider-Man. But I have personally had quite a few issues with the game crashing and visual bugs. Gameplay is just as good as the previous to title. It just feels like it didn't get the polish it deserves. Maybe they will fix it with an update.
148,mkl006,"Nov 16, 2020",7,"Pros: Graphics, enhanced side missions with a bit of narrative, story. Being Spider-Man still feels awesome.Cons: Lots of bugs, short game overall, enemies are not intelligent or variedI think this is a good game despite the short playtime. Might be smart to wait for sales though."
149,HaloComesBac,"Nov 15, 2020",6,A bit disappointing as a sequel to the 2018 spiderman. This new one is a downgrade in pretty much every way and is more of a DLC the 2018 spiderman is about 10 hours to complete while Miles Morales is 6. Spiderman 2018 had 8 gadgets while 2020 had 4. See what i mean? down grade.  What killed me was how unsatisfying the ending was because of its similarity to Halo 5's ending. the main characters in both games are getting injured by 'energy pulses' and have to stop some energy source. Only difference in spiderman is the game continues of for a little bit longer and his friend presumably dies. In short. Decent game which would be better as a DLC and not well thought out. Wait for a price drop
150,Mountainman77,"Nov 16, 2020",10,"Good start for the new gen, the raytracing is amazin.It’s  really shows what PS5 can do.The gameplay, story and powers feels like a complete improvement compared to the last one."

154,ManoloRampa,"Nov 22, 2020",6,"El juego está bien, narrativamente se mantiene y jugablemente es sólido, el problema es que es muy parecido al 1, básicamente es mas de lo mismo, para lo bueno y para lo malo. Para lo bueno porque el simple hecho de moverse en el 1 es una gozada y lógicamente también en este.Para lo malo, porque no aporta casi nada nuevo, hasta el mapa es el mismo, está en PS4  y PS5 a 60 euros, y os recomiendo que os esperéis a una rebaja de 30"
155,Jonas-san,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Certes un peu plus court que son prédécesseur, Miles Morales n'en reste pas moins satisfaisant en terme de durée de vie.

158,KeeganGatward,"Nov 15, 2020",9,"What a game to introduce the PS5 to! From the moment the game started, I immediately new that I was in for a treat. The PS5 quick loading and impressive framerate, graphics, etc., make this game a true gem. The duelsense remote added another layer to the immersivity of the whole experience. The story, character developments and overall vibe of the game I really loved; at parts, I had found myself feeling extremely moved and emotional thanks to the realism of the characters and their own stories. As for Miles, Nadji Jeter completely encapsulated who Miles was and how he was able to discover his own Spider-Man. There's something that Nadji does that makes Miles feel so relatable and lovable; therefore, making him my favourite depiction of Spider-Man to date. My online criticism (which is a really selfish one) is that I wanted this game to last forever; which really isn't a criticism, as I understand why it is the length that it is. This is not a Spider-Man 2 videogame, it is a game on its own standard that desired to stand out and distinguish itself from the first Spidey game...and that it does. Regardless, I loved every moment of this game and I cannot wait to play it again. Great job to the entire team at Insomniac for creating this gem!!!"
159,Slanedoggy,"Nov 14, 2020",9,"Miles morales is a short game but in every second of the story I feel immersed and connected to the story. In such little time they give emotional backstorys, how ever there is a little bit of bugs. 9/10 is almost an understatement"
160,Kenjiwu,"Dec 23, 2020",10,"As a first exclusive game on ps5, which has an eye to showing the power of a new generation, Spider Man Miles Morales delivered a phenomenal job.

163,Tommycbs,"Nov 21, 2020",10,A joy to play from beginning to end. I never wanted it to end and can’t wait to start my second play through.  It was better than the first in every way except length ! But it’s a stand-alone so I knew what that meant. Can’t wait for the next one!
164,neo1221,"Nov 16, 2020",4,The game overall is OK but it's crushing a lot and sometimes even shoting my PS5 i Whish they'll fix it
165,SeroledSnikta,"Nov 15, 2020",6,Miles Morales is a great story. They really stepped up there story play... but the gameplay is repetitious. The moves give off a mortal kombat type control play. Square Square Square it’s pretty boring. I had to force myself to finish playing it. 6/10 for me definitely could be better.

Неуверенность Майлза в тени Питера намного лучше, чем неуверенность Питера в тени Тони из КВМ. Насчет лица Питера: Ну ребят, вы серьезно? Засирать игру из-за нового лица персонажа...

173,bewarechameleon,"Nov 13, 2020",5,"the only way i can describe this game is this, marvel's spiderman from 2018 was essentially the resident evil 2 remake. fully fleshed out, plenty to sink your teeth into, a fully immersive story and gripping from beginning to end. if marvel's spiderman was the resident evil 2 remake, spiderman miles morales is essentially the resident evil 3 remake. shorter, less stuff to do, a lighter experience compared to the previous, can feel deflating rather quick if you got your hopes up too fast. i'm not saying this game isn't fun, trust me this game has it's moments. but it also has moments of feeling too familiar and too repetitive. less boss battles, more jumping around, a lot of errand missions, less gadgets. i'd wait for this game to go on sale, i dont want to be too mean as i really did have fun with this game but with how little this game had in comparison to what we got, i just feel deflated"

186,guy1234567890,"Nov 22, 2020",0,Extremely short for the price.  Some of the themes are a bit too in your face and the idea that he is a particular group of people's superhero is just off putting.  Superheroes are for all.
187,Psyclerk,"Nov 14, 2020",7,"Miles Morales takes the original Spider-Man, changes a few details, adds in a couple of new powers to play around with, then calls it a day. If the original had been on PC, what you get in MM could be done in a simple mod, sans the story mode cut scenes and voice-overs. Further, the story seems to use the original game as a blueprint for its emotional beats, similar to how Star Wars Episode VII mirrored the original movie (episode IV).That's not to say this game is bad. If you've never played the original, you will likely be blown away. If you have played the original and enjoyed it, you'll find more of the same. There are just enough new things to deal with to keep your interest.But as other reviews point out, that's because the game is relatively short. In fact, I get the feeling that the developers knew this going in, as a number of skills, upgrades, and even a trophy are all locked behind New Game+. Not a great sign if you are looking for a game with a lot of content.In summary: It's a lot like the original, just a few tweaks, none of which are bad. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it worth slobbering over like so many critics are doing? No. In fact, if you've played the original, you can probably save a few bucks by waiting for a price drop (this is a first party published game)."
188,Rawnchie14,"Nov 27, 2020",6,"One the more disappointing ideas to come from the folks at Insomniac. Sure, this game itself is impressive and I enjoyed it very much so, but it’s terribly short for the price tags they command, and is far too familiar, with some additional polish and animations. Also - missed a huge opportunity to use the DualSense more on PS5 version. I’m left feeling lukewarm afterwards. Also felt like I was a bit, limited with what I could do with Miles vs. Peter - especially when replaying the remaster. Lastly, I was not completely invested in the story. It seemed, casual and lazily written at times. Performances were great, but the actual story, meh."
189,adrii9715,"Nov 16, 2020",8,"What a fun expierience I had playing this game. It feels different from Peter Parker, because Miles has another rhythm, flow, even soundtrack.The only problem I have with this game is that I don't know what it is. Is it an expansion such as Lost Legacy? The game is short and there is no way the game can be this expensive."
190,LuisOrtiz42,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"Me ha encantado, es muy divertido controlar a Miles contra los enemigos, los poderes que tiene lo hacen sentir como si fuera otro juego y la historia también es muy buena aunque se parece mucho a las del primer juego en algunos apsectos.El único incoveniente que yo le veo es que el port para PS4 no está bien optimizado, hubo partes donde se ralentizaba el juego y en una ocasión se me llegó a crashear el juego y tuve que cerrarlo. Espero probarlo en PS5 pronto, ahí ya no debe tene problemas"
191,Nic23,"Nov 18, 2020",9,"Shorter but intimate story, new well developed characters, comical/relatable protag and amazing gameplay that adds new features to the combat.

Я конечно не прошу вас делать как в Ведьмаке, РДР, но хоть немножко то можно было проработать? Из плюсов хочется отметить, классных антагонистов, которые очень круто выглядят. Игра ни так ни сяк.

It makes me even more excited for the inevitable sequel. Combat is more in-depth and varied; cinematography and story is a step up from the last and the swinging... don't even get me started on how fun and stylish Miles' swinging is.

I remember most of the Spider-Man games I played was based on Peter Parker, I love Peter Parker, but I want a change in 2020, and that change came when the next Spider-Man game was going to be based on Miles Morales was announced by Insomniac. But what I did not like is what they did they did with Peter Parker's face, and also you do not get to see his face in the whole game because he with Mary Jane as her Photography. Only the first part of the game you do and the ending. This game is pretty amazing, I'm excited to play this game on PS5 when I buy one."

252,Hokejovy_Svaz,"Nov 13, 2020",7,"Played on PS4!!!In short: Graphics, gameplay and actors are really great. But story and characters are way weaker than in original Spider-Man game. The first part of the story, before Miles creates his iconic Red and Black costume is really greatly built up. But then it's just a cliche story about stopping Bad Corporate. Characters are fine, but they are lacking of emotions and that sucks, because previous game had emotions. Even though for me the Side Quests that had story about Harlem community was way more interesting than main story and that's embarrasing. Don't get me wrong, even the Side story is cliche, but It has spirit and heart of Harlem community and how they view the new Spider-Man. But the Main story as I said lacks emotions, character development and something intersting or special and that's shame, because the previous game had a great story with emotions and interesting characters. Not here. And the game has a lot of bugs. I don't know if it's that because I was playing on PS4, but if it is because of it, than Insomniac should have made this game just for PS5, because problems like missing some lines, that characters should have said, or half of main hero's body missing are really affecting the experience and that sucks. Overall it is still a really fun game, that is worth to be played, especially if you are Spider-Man fanboy. 7/10 for me. And I'm really hyped for next Spider-Man game with Peter Parker in main role.And please forgive some grammar mistakes, English isn't my state language, but I really tried. Thanks!"

259,djsponge10,"Nov 13, 2020",10,So every review that’s negative is a 0 and all they say is they ruined Peter Parker. Yknow the guy that isn’t even in the game for 99% of the game. A guy even said he looked up how many bosses are in  the game his review needs to be take. Down he didn’t play the game all of them need to be taken down none of them played this amazing game no it’s not dlc it took me 11 hours to beat the main game id love to know what game has a dlc that’s longer than 10 hours this is a full game and it improves what’s wrong about the original it’s on par with the original only problem is miles isn’t anywhere as good as a protagonist as Peter. Also btw the Peter face change was great his old face was ugly now he looks like he’s actually 25 instead of 39 he looks great for the 5 minutes he’s in the game
260,Bryce052,"Nov 15, 2020",10,"This is a must buy for next gen gaming-excellent graphics and gameplay. The streets of NYC feel so alive which makes for an engaging open world experience. The story itself is a bit short with around 8-10 hours of gameplay, however, there are countless other side missions, tasks, and unlockables to keep playing. The included remastered version of Spiderman is another bonus to buying this game."

263,Messiah101,"Nov 13, 2020",9,The game was AMAZING!!!!! The story was very good it was short but it doesn’t matter because like I said it was very good the story has a very good message to it. The web swinging is heavily approved it more fun u can do more tricks the animations are different the combat is better and it’s more fun too especially since u have powers. The graphics are better the attention to detail is amazing when u dive. You can see the suit ripple because of the wind and then the endgame is good unlocking suits and crafting gadgets feel rewarding. The side mission don’t feel like chores collecting the collectibles are fun and I just 100% the game it took like 22 hours. I’m playing new game plus right now I would give it a 10 but I did run into like two or three bugs but I can not wait for the next spider man game!!!!!!
264,RochaVmartin,"Nov 14, 2020",10,"Personalmente me encanto, eso si mas corto de lo habitual pero aprovecharon bien ese tiempo para contar una historia de gran calidad. Los graficos son increibles, la jugabilidad si bien es muy parecida a la anterior, Miles consigue mostrar su propia personalidad y me encanta y esto implica de manera perfecta en el balanceo.Excelente juego para comenzar la generacion"

266,TRUMPisGONE,"Nov 13, 2020",10,"The low review scores are from the triggered trump cultists crying about the BLM suit, xbox kids having no exclusives to play, and weirdos crying about peter parker's face. If you liked the first game, you'll like this since it's a continuation of the CTNS dlc."

Pero tengo que decir que el Marvel´s Spiderman Miles Morales es muchísimo mejor, es algo mas que una expansión. Su combate con poderes eléctricos y la invisibilidad es un buen añadido, la historia es profunda y madura como la del primer Spiderman de PS4, el uso del compañero gato me encanta y a la vez te da ternura. Es algo mas que un DLC o expansión, es una verdadera secuela. Gracias Sony e Imsomniac Games"
269,dnztanaci,"Nov 13, 2020",10,The only issue I had was it was a bit short. other than that its really good. Stands shoulder to shoulder with the original and many other well rated ps exlusive of the last generation such as ghost of tsushima and god of war.

278,soktumbey,"Dec  1, 2020",6,It is way behind the first game. Campaign is much shorter and the number of bosses are less.Ray tracing on PS5 is impressive though.
279,Ghoster,"Feb 12, 2021",3,Wait for a sale! It's really only DLC for previous game (3 hours or so long). Graphics does not look much better than on PS4 (except some ray-tracing). If you need awesome launch PS5 game play Demon's Souls. This one not worth your time!
280,Steyraus,"Dec 30, 2020",0,"Very expensive for its length and reused content, also why does petter look like a **** now ??!??... Its a much lesser version of the first game.. Story was kind of stupid, why is everyone Miles knows a super person.Seriously everyone close to him is super for completly diferent reasons.Didnt really care about the chatacters and it felt way more grindy and padded out. Also the venom powers were a let down. Felt tacked on at the expense of an already good control scheme.. Really strugled to finish it.Also I am not a fan of real world politiics being used to sell a game. America is not tbe only country with probalems,but they make damn sure their petty crap is all anyone hears about withtheir entertainment and media industirys .. I feel very negative towards this game because they brough politics to the converation."
281,lager96,"Nov 30, 2020",9,Spider-Man: Miles Morales takes what was great about Spider-Man (2018) and builds it's foundation upon it. Everything that was bad about Spider-Man (2018) has been improved in this game. The side quests have been much improved and the same crime activities are no more. The story is great and benefits from it's shortened playtime at around 10 hours. The gameplay and visuals are amazing on the PS5 and it's a great first step into the next generation of PlayStation!

284,HTGamer,"Dec 28, 2020",8,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (henceforth MSMM) is a great continuation of the Marvel's Spider-Man game released in 2018 on PS4. MSMM's 8-hours-long main plot follows Miles Morales on his journey to prove himself worthy of being Spider-Man. Likeable characters include Miles' mother Rio Morales and uncle Aaron Davis. Roxxon's Simon Krieger is a forgettable bad guy. Phin Mason is a female version of the Tinkerer aka Phineas Mason, with the intent to highlight more obscure villains from Spider-Man's rogue gallery, but actually this version screams of SJW agenda and forced diversity BS. This female character is likeable but should have been named as someone else. Even creating a new character for the game (just like the Arkham Knight in the eponymous game) would have been a better idea. But as the Tinkerer, Phin Mason just doesn't cut it. Sony and Insomniac Games made the controversial decision to change Peter Parker's face with a new actor's likeness, closer to that of Hollywood actor Tom Holland. Some people like the change, others hate it, I am somewhere in the middle. Gameplay is the same as it was in 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man. It's an open world where you traverse by slinging from bulding to building. Combat is still very smooth and sublime, topping even the combat system of the Batman Arkham games. Miles Morales comes equipped with a few extra powers relative to Peter Parker, namely venom (bio-electric) attacks and invisibility, just like in the comics. This game takes advantage of the Dualsense controller's haptic feedback, but its implementation is way more subtle than Astro's Playroom's excellent showcase. MSMM is a smaller-scale stand-alone game in the style of inFamous: First Light and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. It was developed by Insomniac Games in 2 years in order to coincide with PS5's launch while also releasing on PS4. On PS5 the game features all the next gen bells and whistles such as ridiculously fast loading times and multiple graphical modes. The game originally launched with 2 graphical modes, Fidelity (4K, 30 fps and Ray Tracing) and Performance (1440p, 60 fps, no Ray Tracing). In the weeks following launch Insomniac Games managed to add via patch a 3rd mode named RT Performance which combines Ray Tracing and 60 fps with a few compromises in RT's settings and a lower resolution (something closer to 1080p than 1440p). No matter what mode you select image quality is excellent and the game plays great, but I recommend playing with the new RT Performance mode. The only objective downside to this game is its nature of being a quick project designed to launch with the PS5. Developers understandably had to reuse assets and code from the original game in order to speed up development, but the game doesn't feel that fresh when compared with the 2018 game. Other than that, I disapprove of a few minor SJW agenda references put in the game. I've had enough of this forced BS in recent years. As of posting, MSMM costs quite a lot of money for what is a 8 hours-long game (maybe 12-15 hours with all side content). Currently this game isn't good value for money, but in the future when the price will have dropped to 20 dollars/euros it will be a great deal. Currently MSMM (as well as Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered) is plagued by bugs. My PS5 crashed 2 times (thankfully there was no hardware issue and no save file was lost, problem was solved with a restart) while playing, so hopefully Sony and Insomniac Games will release patches both for the console's OS and the game's code in the near future. Overall, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an enjoybale game that also showcases some of the PS5's potential. I recommend this game to everyone."
285,AlucardPE,"Nov 17, 2020",8,Na minha opinião esse jogo é uma DLC de luxo. Mas isso não tira o seu mérito já que é porta de entrada para a nova geração.
286,Daviddam,"Dec 21, 2020",10,"Great game, great graphics, nice story, feels extremely comfortable to play and the controls are really smooth and clear. For me this is a perfect game!!"
287,dr0nzer,"Aug 28, 2021",7,"I really enjoyed the peter version of Spider-Man on PS4, this version of the game, whilst higher in production value, had a lot of short comings, everything felt really staged in the story, the fights were all really overtuned, especially the boss fights which really took the fun out of the game, I weren’t as connected to the game as I were with the PS4 version. All the side activities lacked quality and were more quantity to pad out the game time. Web swinging felt off, sometime you just want walk off an object but instead you end up flying forward a large distance because of the swinging mechanics…Length was short but to be honest, I wanted it to be shorter because the game wasn’t doing it for me."
288,elLewy,"Nov 21, 2020",10,"A lot of complaints are down to how short the game is. I got 20+ hours and a platinum trophy, and I spent £50. Less than most games out now. It's an incredible game. Yes it's similar to the PS4 version but why change what isn't broken? The suits are great, the story is fantastic, and it's Miles Morales! Bare in mind, the devs never marketed this as a full length game. It was also an expansion. Also, to reference a lot of complaints about the redesign in Peter, it does grow on you. I have began to like it. People just love to complain about anything for no reason. Why does a game deserve a straight up 0 because it was short? People have no idea how to score a game effectively. It deserves 10's across the board."
289,FNDO,"Dec 27, 2020",10,"Insomniac creates incredible graphics, strong narratives, and characters to empathize with, Miles Morales is a strong welcome to the PS5."
290,JohnnyJL96,"Nov 18, 2020",10,An Excellent Spider-Man game with no padding and giving us a straight up great story for Miles Morales. Incredible job by Insomniac games.
291,dbzfan2012,"Dec  4, 2020",0,"A really good game that serves as a great segway into the eventual Spider Man sequel. The game is shorter than the original, but makes up for it with a cheaper price and a great story and improved combat. Even with it being shorter, it took me almost 20 hours to beat the game and get all the achievements, so I would say it is money well spent."
292,crazyking321,"Nov 21, 2020",6,"The game is fun and looks nice on the PS5, but the end seemed a bit lazily designed."
293,SparkySpice0911,"Nov 19, 2020",10,"Words can’t describe how truly special this game is. Insomniac delivers a stunning and action packed spin-off game to Marvel’s Spider-Man (2018), with vast improvements made to animations, combat mechanics, open world exploration and story structure/pacing. Miles Morales is in many ways better than Marvel’s Spider-Man, however the only slight quibble I have with it is the that it does feel slightly shorter. However, considering Insomniac did not prove this at $70 U.S, I have very little to complain about. There is a solid 8-10 hours of pure fun, emotions and exhilarating set pieces. It’s a masterpiece of game design that I will be sure to revisit soon."
294,Ianjong0,"Nov 30, 2020",10,"Superb game, as beautifully fluid as the first but more condensed and punchy. Great story, hopefully there will be some DLC as it feels like Miles’ story isn’t finished by a long chalk.

Ray tracing is cool but I played my entire run with the performance mode, which was solid and handled every intense battle with ease. The story, the animation work, and the overall package here is phenomenal. I cannot wait for a follow up to the 2018 Spider-Man, the credits left me wanting more. I plan to 100% this one like I did for the 2018 Spider-Man...which is telling, I never 100% any game. Insomniac is a master class studio. 10/10"

316,Spidey2099,"Dec  5, 2020",0,"- Peters face really does change things, Man behind the mask is everything and the new one looks like a baby pretending to be Spider-Man. It doesn't even look like a 17 year old spider man. I would be fine with it if was an update/upgrade but this purely because of the MCU and i do not see any other reasons. They could have listened to the fans if people speacked with their wallets but these companies have way too much power from the top (Not the developers). I am buying the next spider man game when its on ps5 for $20 or less just because of these reasons no matter how good it will be. Companies are because of consumers not the other way around. They should listen to consumers who have supported them for so long. - Was supposed to be a DLC but stretched it out to make it look like a PS5 launch game- Prices should be going lower in the pendamic due to more people buying. And the greed of sony is here with a $50 DLC and $70 game.- Less villains and Boss fights I knew sony was becoming greedy since 2018/2019 when this new generation was about to launch.- Promoting trash games which has lots micro transaction(COD, Avengers, Genshin Impact)- Lied about cross gen games Keep waiting and watch. I wish i could give this game a negative -10 so insomniac and sony would take notice. I think this is mostly sony/marvel/playstation greed to make peters face look like MCU. Way to cheapen this amazing 2018 start of an spider man game series with less then mediocre MCU trash that is Tom as Spider man."

I became a little bit bored after the first few hours and afterwards i didnt even want to start a new game plus. The story itself was kind of interesting... but too short. I really hope that they add some new stuff and new ideas into the second spider-man."

322,Slickery,"Nov 24, 2020",10,"10/10 and that’s not an overstatement at all. It exceeded all kinds of expectations and lived up to the hype and it’s predecessor. I’d even say it’s far better than the first game, but it is a bit shorter but it is not a problem at all because the story totally makes up for it. I loved everything better than the first game. The combat, the powers, the swinging, the enemies and ESPECIALLY the story. The story was the best part! Very memorable for sure. I loved every second of it and it didn’t have any boring missions like the first game. Interesting believable plot twists with a fantastic ending. The replayability is 100% and makes you want to play it INSTANTLY more than the first game. Because the first game I was like ehh because of the filler missions involving MJ and Miles, but this game doesn’t have any of that. In my opinion, this was more than just a “DLC”. I agree with Insomniac Games that it should be $50 (I paid $70 for Spider-Man remastered) because of how short it is, but I would’ve been fine with paying the full price because of how amazing it is. Definitely must play before any other PS5 game and I'm glad to call this my first game on the PS5. 100% would definitely recommend to ANYBODY. The ONLY thing that the first game does better is that Spider-Man PS4 has more gadgets but they make up for this by including Venom powers and invisibility in Miles Morales which make the game way more fun. In my opinion, Miles Morales has taken the crown as the best PlayStation exclusive ever made."

327,acebadger,"Nov 30, 2020",8,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a pretty good successor to the first game in this series. I finished it in two days which I kind of expected from watching some videos covering what some people were pissed about in regards to the game, but being short doesn't really bother me. I'd rather have something short and of quality than something long that wears you out which the first game did to a certain extent (not enough for me to dislike the game though). In that regard I like the game with how it juggles several different characters and plot points. The game continues with plot points from the first game and addresses how Miles and his mother have gotten on since losing the father from the first game, while also exploring his past before inheriting the Spider-Man powers. The combat is just as good as the first game and uses new mechanics that change up how you can handle various enemies, I think within the first half an hour of playing I got a 100+ combo with how fluid the system is. The web swinging also carries over well but I like how the animated Miles' swinging to be more sporadic/loose since he's new to this, it's a small touch but it's one I like."

335,jsarte3,"Nov 29, 2020",8,"This game was an impressive introduction to next-gen gaming graphically. I am not a technical person, but being able to swing in New York as Spider-Man at 60 fps was quite an experience. The story was engaging and I felt Miles Morales is a strong character that I fully invested into. My only gripe is the length of the game which was a short experience. The game costs $50 which is close to a standard price of a full-length game nowadays. I am still in awe of how the game looks. It makes me really appreciate the creators of this game and I am looking forward to what Insomniac has in store for us fans of both games"

339,Flashcam,"Nov 30, 2020",10,"If you've played spiderman on ps4 or already own it I would say that this bundle may not be worth the sticker price.  However, as someone playing my first game on the new PS5, coming from Xbox this game is fantastic.  It's been quite some time since I played through an entire storyline along with side missions and actually finished (most) of everything.  The storyline, while it is short as many have pointed out it's a great 7-10 hour experience.  The story did a great job to develop the character of Miles, and make the player root for him.  I think Miles is a great character, and they do a great job of showcasing his life and making him relatable to everyone.  While I can't review the original game here, if you do not already own it, that definitely adds to the value of this game."

Here's my opinion and this game is a DLC, it feels like they did us and Miles dirty because this game was not fully flushed out the story was not hard to predict and sure enough it went exactly as i assumed now we paid for a DLC the price of a triple AAA game. Wait for a sale don't pay full price oh and by on ps4 2 for 1."

348,HappyNebula,"Feb 23, 2021",10,"Miles Morales is another great hit by Insomniac team, they nailed the narrative, characters, visuals and gameplay. It’s a game about social/cultural diversity and representativity brought to a universe of a beloved super hero in a videogame. It’s a game about living in community and respect for each other. It’s a game about self-learning and understanding how to self-accept. An approach that is important nowadays and something that we need to see more often in videogames. All of the aforementioned characteristics of this game are expressed by the many great characters and how the narrative unfolds between them, either by doing the main quest or side quests. Alongside the well written narrative, the performance of actors/voice actors are top notch with a well-done animation too. Yes, it is not a long game, you can complete the main quest within a few hours, but you’ll probably want to do all the other things like side quests, challenges or just explore the gorgeous New York city in winter. This will take a few dozen hours more. And it’s definitively worth it. This game is visually impressive on PS5. Seeing the ray traced reflections of the buildings while you swing around the streets of New York with a buttery smooth 60 fps is simply amazing. The ray tracing reflection is just not about visuals, but also helps with awareness of the environment and enemies. And talking about awareness, this game also does a great use of the 3d audio (tempest engine), it adds depth and precise placement of the sounds, making it one of the most immersive city that I ever heard in a game. Don’t forget to turn this option on in your PS5. Another technically impressive achievement is the absence of loadings time. It’s so good to jump into the game with almost no waiting time or to fast travel in a blink of an eye. Regarding gameplay, Mile Morales uses the same great mechanics found in 2018 Marvel’s Spider-Man. Miles performs swings with more acrobatics and have his own set of abilities. The combats still fun and traversing through the city is always very pleasant. I just think they could use the adaptative triggers and haptics of DualSense in a more profound way. It’s an OK application. In summary, this is an excellent spin-off to the Marvel’s Spider-Man franchise. All that you loved in the 2018 game is also in Miles Morales. It’s a PS5 must have. And I hope that Insomniac Studios keep up with their great work."

351,MakwLoQ,"May 18, 2021",6,"Wow, a tiny little adventure from Sony and a great show off of the Ps5 hardware. Before i review this i must ask you [if you are wanting to buy it] to wait for a sale, this game was incredibly quick and i 100% it in 2 weeks. But without further ado' here's my review. Now the first thing you notice in a game are the graphics, and this game is eye candy, the first game ive ever played in 4k and there has yet to be a game that is better looking than this one, it is one of those rare games where the graphics are on par with the trailer graphics especially when performing a finishing move you really get to see the fibers of his skin so smoothly. But the graphics truly look the best in photo mode, i have looked online and it is truly incredible what some people have done with it, recently sony has added an update for miles muscles making photo mode 2x better, times square is a go to place for photo mode especially when using a reflective suit. even when standing on a pole you can still capture a beautifull photo showing off the themes of new york. Now lets get onto the combat, where this game shines in. The combat makes you feel so powerfull, as soon as i started fighting i emediately started spamming triangle[in the first game you could just counter and dodge anything with it] it sorta worked and i got hit a few times but when you start messing around with those powerfull purple weapon guys you really need to start fighting properly and figure out how to get past them. But the combat is so smooth and clean, it was so much fun and honestly some of the most fun ive had in a single player game for a while. But whats fihgting without a big bad guy to fight? The villians are dull and genaric, the rhino fight was fun the first time but efter fighting him so many times it started getting boring and just unthrilling. The prowler was kind of a thrill at first, hes more of a guide to miles in the beggining teaching you about many gadgets witch will allow you and help you to progress in many situation but towards the end he just turns into a filler so they dont go more than 2 hours without a boss fight, i understand that prowler is miles uncle [not a suprise ive already seen the spiderverse] and is trying to stop him from going to fight but it just falls flat and the fight is not something memerable at all. The tinkerer fight is another plain and simple one, not anything that is too special its more of dodge and hit, once youve memorised here abilitys shes as good as yours to beat, not really emotional considering how short the story was you didnt have much time to bond with her. A not very memorable story and right off the bat spiderman is beaten badly by rhino althoug last game he beat 4 villians and doctor oc at the end of the game. So roxon pulls up and you emmediately know hes the bad guy in this game, i feel like this couldve been done better but i guess they needed filling in their 7 hour game. To shorten this up its a goose chase witch leads you to the final battle, the ending is supposed to be emotional but if they introduced her in the first game then i would have at least felt something but this just fell flat and really ruined the emmersion. A generic superhero story, theres not much to say about it, it just sucked. If they would have worked with another studio it could have been longer. in roxons evil layer i just began to cringe at how generic all this stuff is, although towards the end it did have a cool moment of miles fighting against the machine power orb thing. Speaking of miles, whats a game without a main character? First off, Miles voice is extremely annoying in this game and i turned down the volume of my tv, i understand miles is young but really? constant voice cracks? I really feel like they could have done more with him, his powers are cool but it also leads to the generator missions, no variety in those and i began to groan every time he had to ""Fix the generator!"" like goddam did that get old quickly. The henchmen got old real fast as well i began to refer them as the purple guys and the red guys. But anyways miles needs to learn how to handle his powers witch he does emediately. He figures out his friend that we know nothing about is the tinkerer witch he is all confused about for around 30 minutes. Theres alot to say but in short, they missed an oppertunity to put in memorable new characters and does not have enough bonding moments with the characters, it was too short for me to enjoy it because as soon as it started getting good, it was over."

363,ReubenIsAGod,"Dec  8, 2020",8,"I recommend waiting for the game to drop in price before purchasing.I LOVED the story here, it really worked for me (the biggest weakness being the short length and not enough time to really feel a certain conflict with the main villain) I also found Miles as Spider-Man much more enjoyable and compelling compared to Peter (he gets really annoying in this game...I think it's the new Face Model, it doesn't work for me)I also really enjoy how simple and sweet a lot of the side-content is....however...This is way too expensive for what you are getting. This is (essentially) just 1/3 of a game for roughly $100 NZD dollars.I would seriously consider waiting till the game is around the price tag of 40 - 50. Overwise purchase another game with more content. I could honestly justify spending 40 on this, but 100 NZD was way too pricy. *Updated*I have to know 100% this videogame. I really really love this aye. Like damn, every side quest in this game really adds to the story (even the collectibles, you get fantastic little bits of dialogue and story fleshing out through them) The biggest flaw to these is definitely just the sameness of them. Otherwise, I'm rather quite excited to see where they go with the sequal. Gonna bump up the review to a solid 8.5/10."

365,Lotfi09,"Jun 12, 2021",9,Awesome start to the next Gen !!!! Roll on spider man 2. Didn’t think I would like it as much but Miles is his own spider man.
366,dilemma,"Nov 25, 2020",9,"Awesome ! Let it be known I have not played the Ps4 version yet (Amazing Spiderman) If you haven't played either... Well.. Miles looks and feels amazing.  If you have a high end 4k HDR TV, playing the game at 30 FPS is actually really nice, but you can swap to 60 for framerate.  The game looks beautiful.  A lot of the Quick time events, or story missions, seem to render at a higher quality (Think first 15 minutes of Last of Us) and it's incredible. Thoughts: I don't play a lot of single player game, nor do I beat a whole lot either but two titles that i found extremely fun and worth my time is Infamous: Second Son and Miles Morales.  There's a lot of quick time events, but they are fun and exciting.  It takes place around Christmas time so you get to swing through a snowy NYC.  This adds an extra touch considering there will be a lot of gamers playing this on Christmas Day. Strengths.  Gameplay, it's smooth.  Think Batman basically.  Swinging though the city is easy and feels extremely rewarding when done properly.  It's so much fun to run up a sky scraper and swing in-between building.  The game environment (City) looks amazing.  You will be amazed when climbing the Empire State and looking over an seeing all the building in high detail! I like how easy it is to do side missions.  They pop up on the ingame phone app and spawn randomly when you are close by.  I also enjoy collecting the ""Time capsules"".  Fun lore. My biggest con is lack of boss battles.  I think there's 3 in total but it feels about 1.  Story could be better?  It's over the top.  I don't think it was necessary.  The collecting of the sounds clip is an interesting mechanic but felt like it took me away from my game, or at least really slowed me down when I was trying to progress. Story:  Basically a love story with good and bad undertones.  The ending is a bit of the top.  There's a twist or two and were enjoyed. Characters: Are ok.  I am not a huge fan of Miles but he's a good hero who always does the right thing.  His relationship with the female protagonist is interesting. Movement: Smooth and fun.  No real complaints.  Swinging is a blast, combat is great. Extras: Challenges, Time Capsules (Collecting), Collecting the sound samples, Crime and other tasks done by the in-game app P.S.  Giving a game a low score because it is short is a terrible way to bring down a rating. Price and Time doesn't make a game a good or bad.  That's more of an issue of investment.  I would feel more comfortable spending $50 considering Amazing Spider man is a Ps4 title, and there is a short campaign (but it's packed) and was a launch title.  This won't be effecting my score as it shouldn't."
367,chr1so,"Oct  4, 2021",8,"Spiderman on ps4 was one of my fave games of all time, and while this one is not less good, it doesn't add a whole lot imo, & very short.They've clearly used Miles & friends to shoehorn in some minorities but it's pretty seemless, so props to them for keeping both sides happy & not ruining the franchise at the same time."
368,n_dhruvo,"Dec 17, 2020",8,Got it in ps4 pro and platinumed it. The game is fun. Cant deny that. But it is not as good as the previous one. Miles morales is a great character. The developers and writers did a great job creating miles. He does feel like a peter Parker clone. While peter is more combat focused niles is more stealth focused. He has cloaking ability which basically breaks the game. Cloaking makes it very easy disappear from enemy sights. The main story is pretty weak and short. It can be completed in 20 hrs.
369,guiletheguiles,"Dec 23, 2020",7,"Spider-Man Miles Morales is a good game. Short and sweet, while not being a major improvement over its previous entry. One thing that I want to get out of the way first: The graphics are gorgeous!The first Spider-Man game, on base PS4, already looked amazing, but this is definitely the most significant improvement over the original.And not only it looks good, it also plays great! Swinging around the city is still a joy, the fast-paced combat system continues to excel expectations and unlockables like new suits, gadgets and skills feel very rewarding. The story is also great. While not as involving as the original game, I felt like Miles' story is much more personal, with freedom to take the character into different and more original paths than the ones we've already seen in other Spider-Man media. Great voice performances, exciting action moments and emotional cuts make this game worth picking up. What hurts this game, in my opinion, is the lack of novelty.A few things that I did not like in the original are still here. And since this is a much shorter experience, these things just get in the way of a great story being told.Side quests are still repetitive, but this time they don't add anything cool to flesh out the Spider-Man mythos, like the previous game did with some of them. The lack of enemy variety is sad and in harder difficulties, they still take forever to die.And the worst thing in the entire game: THE PUZZLES!They get old quick. Basically, they turn Miles Morales into a walking ""generator energy"". It's absurd! This game is very short, so buying it at full price might not be the best idea, but if/when you do pick it up, you'll definitely have a great time, whether you're a Spider-Man fan or just a sucker for good Action Adventure games.Now, if you've played the old one, you'll probably reach the credits with the taste of an overglorified DLC, in your mouth..."

While graphics technically superior to ps4 pro, it's not THAT different to blow you away with it's visuals... Overall I would recommend to marvel fans. Might be worth waiting for a sale."
373,mfmaxpower,"Apr 14, 2021",9,"Biggest complaint is I wish it was longer. Also wish the world and side missions didn't feel so generic. But great story, great visuals, great combat (though it needs an update), and just a lot of fun."

375,SuperkenGaming,"Jan 20, 2021",8,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles MoralesThe exaggerated swagger of a young black teenIs it a full game is it not a full game, this is the question.. nd the answer is.. no…I don’t care what anyone says… Miles morales is a 6 hour long expansion to 2018’s spiderman, theres nothing wrong with that.. but that’s what it is and feels as such.. more of the same, though this time you play through the very rushed story of Miles Morales, who is left with New York city in his hands to take care of while the og spiderman goes to hangout with his boo. Obviously there are tons of collectables and pretty okay sidequests to do around this 6 hour long story, but since it feels like more of the same.. I didn’t care too much to do what felt like, heres more content patched into that game you really loved 2 years ago… though to mix things up, miles morales feels more like batman mixed with spiderman, and I love that, my favorite moments of the arkham games is lurking in the shadows and just snatching fools up, and its just as satisfying here to clear a room without engaging in combat.. and I was mostly pushed towards that because sadly the combat just isn’t satisfying here, don’t get me wrong, it stylish and flashing, you feel like a true hero when you pull off perfect combos, and you alredy know the swagger is exaggerated, but the enemies feel like sponges stopping miles mroales from feeling as satisfying as it could.. which again kept me away from doing too much side activites, im either going to be suffering through the spongey combat, or im going to be doing some dragged out puzzle of connecting electricity with my web…Miles Morales is definitely a great game, with great characters, its beautiful, the music is amazing, and it tells a really touching story, but this is really just a really well put together expansion… no matter what anyone says.but with that being said, it’s a great expansion to an amazing game, one with mechanics that feel smooth, the most fun open world outside of an assassins creed gameAnd with its own platinfum trophy and the $20 discount, I guess that’s okay.I give Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Moralesan 8/10"

378,Necrophat,"Sep 13, 2021",9,"An excellent game, around 7-10 hours for the main story, more if you want to do the side questions/collectables etc. It's funny seeing poor reviews based on the games shortness, this game came out not long after Spider-Man 1, it wasn't marketed as Spider-Man 2 or anything like that, it's a shorted condensed story, the game is excellent. People expecting 20-30hours all of the time, sit down."
379,SuperDuck23,"Jul  6, 2021",9,A brilliant spin-off sequel that maintains the high standards of the original 2018 game. The gameplay is more or less the same but that isn't a problem when it's so much fun. The story and characters are the strongest point of the game for me - which kept me intrigued all the way to the satisfying conclusion. It doesn't outstay its welcome and is a nice game to play during a short holiday break.
380,egm954,"Apr 19, 2021",8,"Game itself not bad for launch title on ps5 it’s decent . I played much Spider-Man on ps4 now I have good feeling continue play this game too. Nothing terrifies me honestly graphics looks good new RTX also looking good , stable frame rate absolutely new experience from new vibration on dual sense and e.t.c.

385,spadePerfect,"Nov 23, 2020",9,"While a bit thin on content plus the new PlayStation price tag are kind of a hummer when compared to the original Marvel's Spider-Man, Miles Morales is a compressed version of the first game that gets even more right.The 1st game already had brilliant combat design that shifted between gameplay and cinematics perfectly. Still it is arguably impossible to go back after playing Miles Morales. The characters are likeable, the story is well paced, the gameplay is superb. They took the near-perfect execution of the great but proven concept of combat like the Arkham games - and brought it to the next level. Really, the only bad points are the short length, price and its technical side. While the game performs mostly great it is easy to notice it has ot seen the amount of polish the original game hasStill an absolute must play. I can't weit where Insomniac take us next with their ""Playstation Spiderverse""."

393,Kyreth07,"Jun 25, 2021",5,"Having only played Spider-Man in the remastered PS5 version for the first time a while ago, Miles Morales feels very much like a proper DLC to that game, which is fine on one hand considering it's simply just as fun of a game with similarly impressive cinematics, as well as a few minor new mechanics and improved lighting and such. But at the same time, it's too short and unremarkable to justify its steep price tag. I found myself very disappointed with story and characters, they're not nearly as gripping and fleshed out in my opinion and the side missions and activities are just as middling and repetitive as they were in the 2018 game. Peter Parker already felt generic as a protagonist, but was elevated through an amazing support cast. Miles Morales is even more boring and this time, the side characters and antagonists don't even carry their own weight. But it's not like you really get to form some kind of emotional bond with them, because everything is so rushed and shallow. The game loves to throw the player in the middle of things without properly introducing or explaining them and to me it always felt like I was missing hours of content / context, which caused the plot ""twists"" to simply not work at all. But aside from its awful writing, Miles Morales is an okay experience overall in terms of gameplay. Unless you're a big fan of the comics or *really* want more Insomniac Spider-Man though, you're not missing out on much if you skip this one."
394,AsianJakePaul,"Nov 27, 2020",8,"Really fun game with a lot of heart and good intentions. Gameplay and graphics were top notch but the story itself is very short, I've finished the game in 7-8hrs. For 65$ CAD thats a bit short I think."
395,san40511,"Jul 25, 2021",4,"Short, empty, BLM - The game is too short for full price, BLM everywhere. I think games especially games like this should avoid political questions. The game's main idea is that black and white people are not the same and black people should have their own spider man because Peter Parker should protect white people only. The absurd and really broken USA ideology. Mechanic and the physics in the game are perfect."

399,Gobills77,"Feb  2, 2021",8,"Well, I thought this game was fantastic. The graphics are stunning and absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is fun and can be challenging depending 9b what gameplay difficulty you select. Now as you've heard from many other reviewers that the story is incredibly short but I took my time with it and chipped away at it and it wasn't so bad. Completed all the extra/side missions and stuff which prolonged the game a bit but it was fun and I really enjoyed it. It was a good Christmas present from my sister for sure. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys superhero/spiderman games. The story is also quite interesting as well and has a good plot to it although I wish there were more of a variety of bad guys/villains in it but whatever it didn't affect the story imo. It's a game worth playing if you get the chance but I'd wait until it comes down in price or you might feel underwhelmed considering the current price point."
400,B-Bog,"Sep 10, 2021",8,"The review-bombs are incredibly dumb, as always. Really? Y'all crying about Peter Parker getting a different face when you're not even playing as him and barely see him in the game? LMAO what a bunch of losers you are. As for the ""nO pOlItIcS iN mY vIdYa"" crowd: The existence and representation of POC is not ""politics"". If you think so, I've got news for you: You're a racist (whether you're aware of it or not). And no, you don't fight Rhino ""a thousand times"". You fight him a grand total of TWO TIMES. TWO. I guess you guys didn't graduate Kindergarten? lol As for the game: It's really good, at least as good as the original Spider-Man, if not better. I really liked the venom and stealth powers, they are great additions to the gameplay. The story is great, I love the setting of NYC at Christmas time, and, speaking as a white dude, I really liked the representation of Harlem, black people, Puerto-Rican people, deaf people etc. What is true is that the game is pretty short. If you get it as the bundle together with Spider-Man Remastered, IMO you get more than your money's worth. If, on the other hand, you have already played the original Spider-Man, you probably shouldn't pay full price for Miles Morales, as it does really feel more like an add-on. But hey, it's certainly not the first AAA game with a ~10-hour campaign, so I'm not sure know why people are getting their panties all twisted up in a bunch for this one specifically (pssssst, it's because you play as a black guy!)."
401,Nick369,"Dec 12, 2020",9,"The game is indeed a smaller installment, but a great one as well.The main problem right now is that it may be to expensive (considering the length of the game) and a few annoying bugs which can ruin the experience. My main issue were a few bugs (which I can overlook) but most especially the invisibility regenerator: Sometimes it does not show properly when the ability is ready to be used which annoyed me during my playthrough."
402,DOLLAR_376,"Jan  1, 2021",8,"Great game that stands up on its own and sets things up for a sequel to the original entry from 2018. STORY: Shorter and not as deep as the original, but a good origin story for Miles nevertheless. The main missions are fastly paced than the secondary content, and there are less bosses. The characters are what stands out the most, like in the 2018 game. GAMEPLAY: Similar to the previous one, with some new tweaks that keep it fresh. Combat includes new moves and possibilities, while traversal has different animations to fit the new character. Many costumes and perks create interesting combinations, but it can get repetitive by the very end (specially if you played the first one recently). SOUNDTRACK: even better than the first one, more personalized with a urban style. The game runs perfectly on PS5, with minimal loading times and a graphical mode that includes both RTX and 60fps. I did not encounter many bugs during my playthrough, and were only some random npcs glitching. Would recommend the game for 40-50€ maximum."
403,edgard1axl,"Oct 13, 2021",9,"I liked the game, the duration of the game is not long and it's not short either but I had a lot of fun."

405,DKLARZEN,"Jun 13, 2021",0,"The games price vs. the length disappoint me a lot. Nonetheless, this game is very well made and have a pretty solid, but short, story with new characters and pretty much the same structure as its older brother. Graphics looks amazing and the game plays amazing as well. You can see the facial capture being way better looking compared to Spiderman Remastered. Raytracing also does a lot for this game, which doesn't even really short down on the lower resolution thanks to Insomniacs revolutionary temporal injection. Also the loading is insane, and is a nice showcase for the PS5's power. Story is okay keeping you engaged and interested for long enough, but obviously feel very short. We do see some new and exciting characters like the Prowler, but still falls short on some other missed opportunities."
406,bersi84,"Dec 26, 2020",9,"As Spider-Man 1 this is an excellent game in terms of sound design, visual effects, stability and fun. Insomniac cant be praised enough for their skill level in developing games. I did not have a single hiccup, bluescreen or bug in my 21hr platinum playthrough. For me personally the only down-side is the price considering the kind of short main story line. I want to give this game a 10 because it really deserves it but in the back of my head it is a 9 or 9.5 when you need to have attention on where you drop your money. Even bundled in the Ultimate Edition it is pricey but still an awesome game. I feel there is not a single down-side in both those games. One minor thing that came to my attention is that 2 savestates with 2 save slots each seem to take 144mb on my PS5 which seems a whole lot and is a bit strange. If you need to upload 144mb to your cloud storage with a bad connection that will take quite a while. Besides these two things I consider Spider-Man 1 and Miles Morales as an essential. It is also one of the few games that seems to make open world fun and not some boring grind (although it is at times) but the variety and how they handle questing, especially in Miles Morales should be a new standard for all games that try to establish open worlds. Clear recommendation. If you have to watch for the money, wait for a price drop around 20% to make it more suitable."

409,Steddag1,"May  1, 2021",10,"I enjoyed my time as Miles Morales using his electrical and invisible power added on his spider powers! Swinging all around Manhattan! Thats pretty dope they chose one of the biggest part of New York. Swinging all the way from Soho to Washington Heights. Im from Harlem, New York to see that Miles Morales moved in my part of city was dope as well. The different costumes are so dope in this game. It makes you want to play it ovee and over again. People keep saying it dlc but have ya plaued the dlc for Spiderman 2018. Spiderman was only stuck small area of New York not the entire city so give credit to Insomanic for giving the entire Manhattan as playground for the new Spiderman in a short time especial with the best ray tracing at 60 fps on console! Pretty dope! I can't wait for Spiderman 2. Day 1 cop!"
410,david1234,"Nov 29, 2020",0,"- Short, boring, predictable story. Cannot skip most of the cutscenes, even during NG+. Players are forced to play NG+ for the platinum trophy so its a drag especially when you don't like the story- Everything is focused on Miles. Unlike Spiderman 2018, you can play as MJ and Miles for character variety. Here Miles is seen as the protagonist who can do it all- Repetitive uninspired combat. Venom moves are catchy at first but get boring really quickly when you're literally Venom punching your way through the playthrough. Even more boring due to the lack of variety to beating your opponent and the lack of enemies in general- Peter's new face is terrible. Will never be able to get used to it and hopefully, it is changed in the sequel- Forcing political agenda down gamer's throats. Ex. one of the side missions forced you to goto this Black Lives Matter mural. Get this political crap outta games, and keep real-life problems off of gaming wtf? Verdict: Perhaps this game was aimed as an easy cash-grab to die-hard Spiderman fans and day 1 ps5 exclusive, but the game feels very incomplete and rushed. A little deduction point also goes because there is hardly any usage with the dual sense controller utility. Nice graphics don't do any justice for a game with a very stale campaign, uninspired combat, and lack of post-game content. 0/10, either wait for this game to drop in price or just don't get it. Treat this game like some non-canon spinoff movie like Wolverine Origins and wait for the actual sequel Hopefully, Venom finally appears in the sequel and lives up to his hype. And hopefully, they fix Peter's face for christ sakes"

A gameplay é basicamente a mesma coisa de seu antecessor com com algumas leves mudanças, leves demais para ser vendido em um jogo de R$ 249,90.

I think this is a leap down, not up, and to demand the full price for the DLC, as for a full-fledged product is arrogance. The 2018 spider is a head taller than this part. I really liked miles, a charismatic kind character, he fits well into the role of spider. In the game from the strength of only 3 boss-fights, the plot is very weak, a lot of water, the whole game is trampled on the spot, the antagonist is not impressed . The game is much shorter than the original part. The game is weak, so I do not recommend buying it at the start. Only with a big discount on the price of DLC."

The game has amazing visuals (especially on PS5!) and the gameplay is super fun just like the first game. One of the big shortfalls is the length - this is much shorter than the first game.

The combat remains unparalleled and the enemies are even more challenging. Add to that an emotional and compelling story and you have an adventure not to be missed. Compared to Spiderman PS4, I didn't feel the urge to complete the whole game or unlock the districts. That was just a bit too much of the same and a repetition of what we know. But at the end, it was an amazing experience!Pros:- Amazing action scenes- Emotional story- Finally a game that doesn’t take forever to finish (which can be seen as a con for others)- Soundtrack- GraphicsCons:- Beside the main story it is a repetition of the game from 2018 and it’s side content feels like a filler"

But there was something about this DLC-esque sequel that didn't spark that same awe and amazement that the first installment did. I don't know if it was because I was just coming down off a mountain top high of  Demon's Souls, but for some reason this game just felt a little hollow. Like there was more time spent throwing collect-a-thons of every kind and color all over the map than the story itself. The first game I ever Plat-ed was the original Spider-Man PS4 but I would give this game the kind of honor I wanted to bestow upon it's predecessor. That being said, I would never call this a ""bad"" game, just deeply set in the shadow of it's older brother."

437,mplaaguilera,"Aug  1, 2021",3,"Exactly the same as the previous game. You get nothing new here, but a less charismatic character, dumber story, lazy and tedious puzzles and over the top abilities that make no sense even for a superhero game, making the great formula of the first game feel already aged. Also the visual enhancements allowed by the PS5 make less of a difference than I expected.My advice, wait until this is 20€."

Absolutely incredible! I was skeptical about changing the protagonist from Peter Parker, but I'm happy to say that there was no need for any concern - the story was fantastic. Emotional, powerful, exciting, thrilling, these are but a few of the words I could use to describe the main storyline of this game. My only frustration with the game was the unnecessary need to add a political element with the Black Lives Matter mural. This was clearly a last minute virtue signalling exercise by the developers. This is apparent when there are no voice references or engagement. So it certainly wasn't planned. If they really cared they could've added a side mission which involved racial issues. But alas it was this last minute token gesture instead. The characters and story are fantastic, not one second was I even thinking about race until this moment. When will we ever realise that what we have in common is more important than what defines us. BLM is undermining that by demanding that we treat everyone differently rather than the same. It's disappointing that Insomniac Games have added any political statement from the real world into a superhero game. P.S. I cried at the end."

445,joel_tdl,"Jul  2, 2021",6,"Lo Mismo. Pero Para Mal. JUGABILIDAD:Este juego causó mucho revuelo por haber sido concebido como una aventura totalmente nueva y no como una expansión jugable, y ceo que, para variar, las criticas han sido acertadas ésta vez. Miles Morales agrega nuevas habilidades para dar un toque de novedad al juego, pero un par de poderes extra no hacen justicia a ésta secuela/spinoff. Los combos, movimientos, ""trucos"", son prácticamente los mismos de su primer parte. El gameplay es repetitivo hasta el cansancio, y el poco trabajado sistema de combate tampoco ayuda. Las misiones extras y coleccionables siguen siendo repetitivos y fastidiosos, nada nuevo por ahí. Miles, como personaje, está muy por debajo del carismático Peter. Incluso su sentido del humor, que pareciera que es calcado de Parker, se siente tosco y poco interesante. Es uno de esos personajes que no podemos esperar a que cierren la boca. Su historia es aburrida, sosa y con pocos ""ganchos"" para atraer nuestro interés.Por lo anterior, no encuentro ésta entrega precisamente divertida. Como punto positivo encontramos que las pantallas de carga son inexistentes, entre 1-2 segundos y ya estaremos jugando. GRÁFICOS:Al igual que su predecesor, es un espectáculo visual, pero en esta ocasión es con matices. .Al no haber grandes escenas nocturnas, queda desaprovechada la oportunidad de mostrar NYC, con un juego de luces y sombras, como sí lo hacía el primer juego. El nivel de detalle en las cinemáticas es increíble, pero la ciudad se ve un tanto por debajo de la calidad esperada (aunque yo culpo al clima nevoso que han decidido usar en esta entrega). No obstante, los detalles en la iluminación y la cantidad de partículas que se pueden apreciar en pantalla, especialmente durante las cinemáticas, son visualmente apantallantes. Los modelados del rostro de los personajes también han mejorado (no entraré en discusiones sobre los cambios en Peter...), y las permite lucirse mejor que el Marvel's Spider-Man, osea sí, todo lo contrario a los escenarios. SONIDO:La música sí que cambia totalmente. Menos heroico y mas acción. Al igual que con la entrega anterior, las canciones encajan de forma perfecta con lo que se está viendo en pantalla, aunque me han agradado un poco menos que las piezas usadas antes.Quedan con la personalidad de Miles, eso sí. INNOVACIÓN:Miles Morales agrega un par de añadidos, pero no son suficientes para que YO lo considere una evolución de algún tipo.Solo queda una duda, ¿Cómo harán los desarrolladores para no dejarnos estas mismas impresiones con Spider-Man 2?"
446,CorruptedSoul,"Dec 30, 2020",9,"(This is from a ps5 view) the controllers felt really good when you were swinging and shooting webs. The controls are a bit hard to get used to but by half way you should have gotten used to. I like how at the beginning before you start you can preview the story just incase you didn't play the original, its short but helps you understand whats going on. Halfway into the story its really engaging and entertaining especially the ending. I like how there is a warning if you wanna upgrade or change your suit before the end of the story. The ending is very great, it makes for a good story. I like how there is a epilogue so you can still play the game even though the story is over, you can replay missions and still fight crime until you get the trophy. This is extremely fun to play and i would recommend, the only reason why its getting a 9 is because the controls can be annoying and the game could be a bit to hard at times but its still fun and i would recommend."

455,PadFou,"Jan 13, 2021",0,"I loved the first one which is prbable one of my favorite PS4 game. Moving like spiderman is trully amazing and the feeling is perfect.I played almost 8 hours this second opus.This game is so boring, I encountered only one Super-Vilain, at the very begining of the game, and it was not a true fight, it was a tutorial. Nothing more since. If I play a spiderman game, I want to fight against Carnage, Venom, Vulture, Mysterio, SAndMan, Rhino, Hammerhead, Kraven, Elctro or any other main ennemi of SpiderMan. Probably some of them will come later in the game bat that's too late in the game and I am afraid of a very small number of true vilains.Another bad thing about this game, every 30 minutes, I encounter a script issue that does not allow me to complete a mission (ennemi in a wall and unattackable, QTE not launching etc). I have to restart all the mission.I am very disapointed by this game."
456,christayloralt,"Sep 18, 2021",6,"Quite a short game, only maybe worth it if you get the 2 for 1 deal that includes the original game too (with all DLCs). And even then, puzzles and objectives are almost all based around the electricity power, Miles can completely remove tension during gameplay or cutscenes with his invisibility, you only get a few bossfights - including repeated or recycled ones. There's also just far less content there, and the writing does not make up for it sadly, as the most important section just comes down to misunderstanding/miscommunication and the villain gets redeemed instantly at the end. Honestly, Miles and his uncle were great, they could have carried a game on their own, but the writers wanted to focus a lot on social issues and non-issues, as well as put some political messages in prominent places in the game. The other characters were all odd and annoying, with a few exceptions. In a 60 hour game, tastefully spread out in the background, this would be fine, but in an 8 hour game where it's put front and center often, it's definitely intrusive. In a way, the game is mostly carried by being a follow-up to the previous one, using that as a background for the narrative and basis for the world and gameplay. It doesn't hold up on its own. I knew something was off when Pete got beaten by Rhino in the first act, even though he took down multiple super villains including Rhino in one night in the last game. They made him lose there so that Miles could get a big moment, which is great in concept - but come on, at least use a different villain where it makes sense for him to lose."
457,mynameiscalled,"Sep 12, 2021",7,"First off - I am not a big Spider-Man guy, more so, not a big Marvel or superhero fan in general so I went into this game not expecting much. With that being said - I loved this game. At first, I decided to check this game out just to see what my PS5 can do and I heard that this game looks good - this is an understatement - the game looks gorgeous! I played with the middle graphics mode, where the game is running in 60 fps but doesn't have all the shinies on. It looked amazing (like the spiderman, heh) I just found myself checking out the streets and buildings and side-tracking from my missions a lot. Gameplay is fun, fast and clean. Nothing bad to say here. Again, as not so big superhero kinda guy I still had a lot of fun swinging webs and kicking ass. The only reason why this game is a 7 in my book is because I finished the main story in 6h 30min. Which is okay I guess - the game is kinda spin-off of the OG Spiderman game and I didn't expect it to be very long. Plus there are tons of side stuff to do and have hours and hours of more fun. If you finish the game, you can free roam and do side-quests. I just was left with the feeling that the story could have been little bit more. Amazing game, pick it up - lots of fun to be had. Maybe try not to pay the full retail price."

459,Xoriatis71,"Feb 10, 2021",9,"(PS4) Marvel' Spider-Man: Miles Morales is one of the best Spider-Man games ever made. The story, although short, is coherent and well written, the pace is excellent (Some people may find it a little too fast for their taste) and the characters are fun and charming. Gameplay-wise, the web-swinging is spectacular with more fluid animations and a much wider selection of tricks to perform. Graphically, the game is a major step up from the last game, with better weather effects and more detailed character models. The lighting has also seen an upgrade. Last but not least, the city is more or less the same, however, it is more detailed and special care has been put into Harlem, which feels very alive. To talk a little about glitches, I encountered some, almost all of them funny and not game-breaking, however, if you want the most polished Spider-Man experience possible, you will have to wait for some patches."

The web swinging is amazing, the only time I fast traveled through my story play through was when I was forced. The story and characters are amazing and make the game come to life, I won't spoil anything but the game was just amazing. The only thing stopping this from being a 100 is honestly the length and side things to do. The game can be finished in a day even if you are a casual player, and the reveal of some of the major story elements are done sloppily because the story is so short. Is this game was even 5 hours longer, I think it would have had more time to build up the plot. As of right now, my rating stands at a 90."

467,drcoomer,"Jan 14, 2021",10,"IMO, this is a masterclass of what a video game should be. It looks great, feels great, the gameplay is awesome, it's well-paced, and most of all it's just flat out F U N. Being the very first title I played on PS5, this game had some high expectations to live up to. And boy, did it deliver. The graphics are the best I've ever seen. I expected nothing less, as it is the starting point for a whole new generation. But I was absolutely impressed from start to finish with the graphics in this game. The design and use of vibrant, explosive colors really shows that they learned something from ""Into The Spiderverse"". It works just as well here as it did in the movie. 10/10 The narrative is short and sweet, but delivers an engaging story that showcases a whole new Spider-Man & Co. The versatile Miles Morales is more than up for the task. In fact, he may even be my new favorite Spider-Man to play as. But where this game really stands out, much like the first game, is its gameplay. The combat in Spider-Man is just so fun. It's the smoothest combat out there, and Spidey's arsenal of moves and gadgets allow you to approach each encounter differently. And the animations on finishers look so freakin' bad ass. Even just roaming the city is amazing. Swinging through scenic New York City and taking in all of its beauty never gets old. It really makes you take a step back and realize that the new generation is HERE and it is HERE TO STAY. 10/10"

Ну это о впечатлениях, сюжет скучен и довольно предсказуем, драки с боссами не интересные, квесты и доп задания вполне неплохие и приятно, что за каждый из них дают костюм или какую то другую штучку.  Новая боевая система и камуфляж прекрасны, драка с биоэнергией превосоходна, красочна и бесшовна, очень приятная боевая система и довольно многообразная, каждый эффект и добивание красочны, но при этом не выбиваются из общего ритма. Маскировка позволяет реально застелсить там , где хочется. Искуственный интелект в плане стелса очень слаб, в плане боя достаточно неплох, бои на высоком уровне сложности очень интересны и требуют навыков владения приемами. Режим графики тоже неплох, очень реалистичной и красивой становится картинка, однако все таки 60 фпс пока стоят выше чем ретрейсинг и тд.

479,DomTheBomb28,"Feb 17, 2021",8,"Spider-Man PS4 was a game that had the crowd going wild. Nevertheless, the game was awesome. 2 years later, its now Miles's turn to take the wheel while Peter hits the backseat in the spin off titleSpider-Man: Miles Morales. First off, we cant go too in depth without talking about the impact the PS5 brings to this game. With 4K graphics and two graphic options, the game just looks gorgeous. Playing on the butter smooth 60fps Performance Mode, or taking the other route and playing on Fidelity Mode, which drops the frame rate to 30fps, but makes up for that with the jaw dropping ray tracing. Either way, your getting the full next gen experience. Now, its story time. In this Spider-Man title, The veteran Spider- Man, Peter Parker, is taking a break and going away for two weeks to assist MJ in Symkaria, he then leaves Miles the task of being the only Spider-Man that NY will have. During this time, Miles discovers the Underground, a high tech organization that is going after Roxxon's new energy source, Nuform. Its now up to Miles to take the lead and discover the true motive of the Underground and put a stop to their movement, while finding out what it means to be his own version of Spider-Man. While the story has nice depth and meaning, its very short. People were completing the game in a day which isn't great for a game like Spider-Man. Most people worried about this game being a copy and paste version of Spider-Man PS4, however, it is far from that. The web-slinging has never felt better thanks to the DuelSense controller's adaptive triggers. The way Miles moves when swinging gives you the feel of a younger, mid experienced Spider-Man rather than Peter's older, veteran, Spider-Man. When Miles's web zips to a certain point, you can see him trying balance while landing. The little animations give you that ""This is a different Spider-Man"" feel. Miles's new bio electric Venom Power, Camouflage Power, and Gadgets, play a major change in combat when it comes to its heavy use in there respective scenarios. The skill tree gives a wide selection of new abilities too. The suits in the game are amazingly detailed, no matter how basic the suit looks. Each suit mod brings something special to the table, and yes, I'm looking at the Into the Spider-Verse suit mod. For future DLC, its safe to say we would all love to see more fan favorite suits come into the game. The photo mode in the game is so outstanding and easy to use just like in the first game. Pose Miles's in many different ways and use funny filters and stickers to create silly and cool photos, or use other graphical filters to recreate scenes from your favorite Spidey film or just make a badass photo in general. In all, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a great way to show the power and potential of the PS5, however lacking in story length and bosses. Nevertheless, still also kicking off the new generation of gaming with other awesome titles."
480,sh1ngek1fan,"Nov 22, 2020",8,"A great follow up to Insomniac's first Spider-Man game, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a fun time with great gameplay and a good story with loveable characters. Graphics are improved from the first game and combat is still a lot of fun. I also enjoyed the game's take on characters like Miles, Genke, the Tinkerer, and the Prowler. The secondary villain is pretty generic but at least he's played well. My only big criticism is the redesign of Peter Parker's face. I liked the old design and not only does the new design make Peter look way younger than Miles, when he's supposed to be a mentor, but it looks too much like Tom Holland. It seems like Insomniac was trying to appeal to Marvel fans here when the old design was its own thing and didn't need changing. Still, this issue did not ruin my enjoyment of Spider-Man: Miles Morales, as it is a great game. It is a lot shorter than the first one but is still highly enjoyable."
481,MANXMAN76,"Oct  1, 2021",6,"TBH I found this boring the game felt way too short, the combat is too easy as well as stealth, the suits feel underwhelming, recycled bosses and adding snow and some Christmas decorations didn't make the experience any better, the music was ok, the voice for miles at times felt whiny and the game should be double the length this should have been a dedicated miles game with new villains and ecstatic gameplay for the ps5 but instead it kinda fell flat let's hope that they go all out on the next spider-man and wolverine games."

483,illuvatar_1st,"Apr 20, 2021",8,"The game is the official sequel to the Marvel Spiderman 2018.It is NOT just a reskin and Miles and New York are very different than the other one . The game is an improvement in terms of gameplay however it has one MAJOR FLAW.....The story is the 1/4 of the original and as a result i cannot seem to care about its story. To elaborate ,Miles is already a well established entity on the series from the 1st game however all thee rest had to have some introduction and development.However i personally went out of my way to do all optional interaction, side missions and collectables to get to understand miles struggles BUT before i knew it the Game was over.Climate scenes did not feel right.Here's an example ... When peter was struggling near the end, we (Gamers) cared about his struggles and pain as we get to experience all of it throughout the campaign. We saw his relationships, his guilts, his struggles and pain, however in Miles, we re thrown into a cutscene, we were told  this is what you should believe and there we go. Overall it's a good game whose only drawback is the Short story."

485,VlueStar,"Jan  4, 2021",4,"The game is ok but they could’ve done so much more... The story is not interesting, and even when it is it still feels lackluster and misguided. The main protagonist reminds me of Nadine in uncharted 4 when she just beats down the player in every cut scene they have. I mean it’s effective storytelling, but highly unlikely, and a strange choice for the main plot. She’s also probably the least interesting character they could’ve chosen from the spiderverse, and everything is she does is cliche af. You can beat the game in like 3 hours if you want to, because it’s literally like 5 missions and your done. They made a short game and still put out of suit gameplay in it... I feel like I paid for a fleshed out demo rather than a full game."
486,Boozix,"Nov 25, 2020",5,"The Game is good, you have fun playing it, but honestly way too short, near to zero known bosses and a scenario that would fit in a single toilet paper.

487,Bartholumu,"Nov 20, 2020",9,This game is just pure amazing! The score in this game is just a nice touch as well. Something that I also enjoyed was music playing while you swung around New York City. I am someone who likes to 100 percent these games and I have played 14 hours and I’m still not done. I understand that the game can be short but so can the first Spider-Man game. If you just go full story for the first game you can beat it roughly 7-8 hours. These games aren’t made just for you to speed through the game the game highly encourages you to explore the map get the skills and tech parts which are beneficial later on as you play. This game is just as good and a nice “expansion” to the first game.

490,martinho_99,"Apr 17, 2021",4,"First the positive things: Miles is a great character with lots of charm. The antagonist is also quite good. The net swinging trough new york is so ingenious, it really never gets boring. New York looks amazing, graphics are top. Fight system has fun combos.Negative points: The game is too short! You can easily finish it in under 20h maybe even under 15h. As I said the antagonist is good but this ""good person suffers from beloved ones tragic death wants revenge gets radical wants to do thing that would cost a lot of lifes but realizes at the end that it is wrong"" thing of a story has been told far too often. The side missions are not entertaining at all and just distraction. At one point even the fun fighting systems gets boring because the setting gets so repetetive - you get to a location beat up the guys beat up more guys and then do a task. Additionally there are almost no upgrades that vary or modify the fighting.The gameplay would have so much potential the graphics and the dialogues are top but 60€ for such little game is a big impudence."
491,Bonjoramigos,"Sep 23, 2021",9,"This game really grew on me. I was going in to the game thinking it was some sort of dlc. But after finishing it, it may be better (in my opinion) than the 2018 version. It is a bit shorter but the gameplay is way faster, the story is very clever and the game looks really nice. If you liked the original than you are going to like this game."
492,Mitchewix,"Apr 30, 2021",8,I absolutely loved the game aside from some political pushes. The main villain is great and the new mechanics are fun. I wish they added a bit more.

498,LilTopi,"Jan  8, 2021",9,"Great game, the story is exciting. This is a short game, but don't try to prolong your experience by spreading it out. This is a game best played in one or two sittings, I played on PS5 and I'd recommend everyone wait till they get their hands on a PS5 before playing it. Overall a well packaged shorter game that's worth every dollar if you like the premise."

501,skeletorcares,"Feb 11, 2021",5,"It's a very pretty game has good controls, but no sustenance. If you're a fan you know most of the ""twists"" already. The gameplay is pretty derivative of the last Spiderman game. I hope the DLC brings some of the actual Spiderman villains into play. At this time, the game is just OK."
502,Awanka,"Aug  6, 2021",5,"There's nothing terribly wrong with the game other then a bit of pandering to social causes, but there's nothing particularly good either.  Gameplay is decent, but it all feels pretty repetitive if you've played the previous Ultimate Spiderman game.  Everything else is fair to bad.  A basic uninspired superhero story filled with perfunctory dialog, awful dad humor, and after-school special moralizing. A series of short and basic sidequests. A lot of these complaints could have been leveled against the first spider-man game, but it completely loses its charm the second time around.  It's a short game, and there isn't anything really next-gen about it.  It's like they just cobbled together something using the first game's engine to capitalize off of its success, and it shows."
503,fortwaynebatman,"Jul  6, 2021",8,This game really is amazing but it is just not up to the same score as the first Spider Man 2018. I like Miles but i don't love him....ya know? He has a nice story to tell and has some unique abilities but what I really love about Spider Man is his rogue gallery and Miles just doesn't have that. The short story and easy platinum is perfect for snack size gaming  though and I did enjoy my time with it. That is why it is a 8/10 from me.
504,Valkillmore,"Jun  2, 2021",7,"I feel like this game was largely overrated. Its essentially a DLC for Spider-Man (2018) with a really boring story, the gameplay additions are really fun though."

508,RetroGameDays36,"Sep 21, 2021",8,"There are some really great things about Miles Morales, but i think it's a bit of a downgrade compared to the original PS4 Spider-Man game, why? Well, it's because the game is short, like shorter than the original one, peter's face, i forgot they made this change but i'm still not ok with this new face, costumes are nice, but again, it's not as good as the original lineup, best one i think is The End suit, real nice insomniac really did a great job at making the world, characters, feel real There are some upgrades in it as well compared to the original, but i still prefer the original because of the story and gameplay."
509,fercho319,"Dec 31, 2020",10,"I give this game a 10/10 because lots of thinks that made the game fill special by miles and his community and family and friends. The story is short but if you also count the secoundary missions the game approximately is about 30,40 hours so it is long enough.The city is the same but it fills different because is snowy, the graphics are 10 the animations of miles by swinging are absolutely awesome. I really recomend this game."
510,mertbcansel,"May  5, 2021",10,"10/10 Standalone game. Insomniac Games really know how to deal with Spiderman games. Combats,, story, music and graphics are awesome. Play that game on Performance RT mode. It provides 60 FPS with Ray Tracing. Plus Spiderman Miles Morales has the best credit scene."
511,propulsion,"Mar  7, 2021",8,"This was a tough game to rate. I think it’s probably an 8.5. To sum it up quick, game wise it is a lot like Spider-Man Remastered on PS5, except shorter. I thought the Spider-Man Remastered (and PS4 version) was amazing...a 9.5 out of 10 for me, a fantastic super hero game, with my favorite super hero as a kid. Besides this game being short, I admit Miles was tough for me to accept at first, when he got spider powers that is. Two Spider-Mans?  That was really dumb to me, just like two Batmans or two Supermans would be.  And I did not like into the spider verse.  Eventually  Miles grew on me in this game, even though he is too much like Peter.  Also there are some politics in this game, which I am tempted to knock another number off for.Bottom line if you crave more of the last game, this one might scratch that itch, cons aside."
512,FRIST_008,"Jun 14, 2021",9,"Самая правильная игра про супергероя, в которую я играл. Такого разнообразия сюжета и механик надо ещё поискать у соперников подобного жанра"
513,1Filip98,"Dec  8, 2020",7,"Game is incredibly short, felt more like a 20$ DLC. City was basically a copy paste with some new locations, but somehow they managed to make more bugs. New Peter is hit or miss, to me he looks like 16 yo teenager, not like 25 year old grown man. who's doing this for +- 8 years. Regarding actor performance, Mile's was pretty good, not like Peter in the OG game, but not bad at all.  No really fun side quests or side missions. Less gadgets in first game, while venom powers were super OP, the game was basically easy mode even on hardest. Story wasn't interesting, some good ""boss"" fights, but nothing that great. The main villain, meh... The characters were sometimes sooo stupid, just to allow the plot to move forward. Like the main female villain of the game. I'd recommend this game only if on sale. Not worth it for the full price."
514,Ducroste,"Nov 19, 2020",6,"It is a game that will never bore you but it should be longer, it only lasted 5.8 hours, and also that there are bugs that can damage your game, the game is good but that must be the ""problem"""
515,Basehype9,"Dec 15, 2020",7,"Superb graphics, throughout the game I often found myself staring at gorgeous textures and environment specially the indoor parts of the game. Lets look at one of the s4's lunch titles namely killzone shadow fall. we can see hoe that game looks now and how outdated the graphics of that game look now. wow just wow we are starting this generation with such graphic quality, I can't even imagine what naughty dog and other studios will accomplish with ps5 at the end of the generation. on the other hand other aspects of the game like story and gameplay look and feel exactly like the first spider-man and to be honest at points it got super boring. felt in regards to gameplay there wasn't much improvement from its predecessor. moreover the story mode is super short and if you collect everything it might take around 10 hours or a little bit more. the story on the highest difficulty took  me about 4 hours to finish."

Po zrestartowaniu gry pojawił się problem związany z wystąpieniem błędu w aplikacji który po odczekaniu około 30 min nic nie ukazywał i zmusił do zrobienia restartu konsoli.

520,Raios-Rogue,"Jun 16, 2021",10,short and sweet game great original story emotional ending great music fantastic gameplay the best graphics this game blows away any PC game when it comes to graphics Insomniac keep updating their game and give love to the fans and the venom bio electric energy made the combat mechanics so much better than the first game with the left and right arrowkey shortcuts where a nice touch top notch motion per object motiom blur makes the fidelity native 4k 30fps mode feel like 60fps the RT performance mode is fantastic as well one of the best way to play the game for sure the game has just a few minor bugs where somehow i went true the wall of a building  while crawling and i got stuck and a few crashes suits could have used awesome abilities like in the first game the muscle deformation Ziva RT filmic quality with hardware machine learning suit they added was awesome best spiderman game up to date it easily entered in my top 20 list of best games of century and became one of my favorite games of all time which i platinumed
521,Cwouda,"May 19, 2021",10,This game is amazing great gameplay and graphics very good story. There is really no negatives to it a must play if you own a PlayStation
522,SeaSphynx,"May  1, 2021",6,Did not live up to the hype for me. It felt like a generic and cheap story put together just so people don't question Miles being a major part of Spiderman 2 PS5. I love the first game's sense of real struggle that Peter had to go through. And I get Miles OBVIOUSLY goes through some hardship through this one too but it just DOESN'T have the same sense of quality that Spiderman PS4 had. Quickly put together and WAAAAAAAY too short for $50. Also some really crappy acting in some spots with some extremely generic characters like one of the main villains (Krieger). I just hoper Insomniac learns that they shouldn't make a short generic game like this again for the same price as this was.
523,SilentChief,"Mar  4, 2021",9,"A truly technical miracle, quality ray-tracing reflections everywhe @ 60 fps. Overhauled combat system is amazing and it probably has the funniest traversal ever. The only downside is its length, but understandable for a launch game. Go play it! :)"
524,Youngish2k51,"Dec 21, 2020",8,"Miles Morales take the regular game and doesn't do much with it. The game is as fluid, slick, and fun as ever and Mile's has his own unique personality instead of just being a peter Parker clone,you can tell he's trying his best to get used to being his own spider-man and that he's still youbg and has along way to go to becoming a professional, while the graphics are great at times they diminish and I really wish we had a mode where we had 60 fps and 4k instead of having to pick between 30 4k and 60 1400, hopefully they make it this way one day, my other complaints are that other than Miles, no one else is really interesting and the characters are just there kinda just being a clique, also I personally didn't really find the story to be all that interesting, Mile's development is what really carried the story and I really wished the game would have tried adding new stuff instead of just some skins and a new move, overall if you own a ps5 I recommend getting this game but don't buy this one, I recommend buying the ultimate edition as it's only $20 more expensive but it comes with a remastered version of the regular game so you're basically saving money."
525,Ight,"Nov 18, 2020",7,"The game is a mixture for me, on one hand it looks gorgeous, and the combat has been refined. On the other hand I wish this game had a 1080p 60 fps raytracing mode since when switching between both modes in the game it felt like i got a major drawback either way. Can't say much about the story, I beat it in 5 hours and I paid 50 bucks for this, i'd wait till it drops to 40-30 dollar range. Side missions felt mostly generic but a little more personal for some of them. I'm rating this a 7/10 for the lack of length considering I beat this in a day, and this game is 10 dollars cheaper than the first game but is nowhere near the time I spent on the previous game"
526,Bike_3809,"Feb  1, 2021",0,"Игра интересна на 20% потом начинается унылое собирательство и пара доп миссий. Можно пройти за один вечер или за пару вечеров на все награды.

Так что не советую"
527,koenhamboy,"May 11, 2021",8,"Great but not amazing, Fun game but didn't excite me after the first game. When I first played Miles Morales I thought it was incredible and I got the platinum trophy in one weekend. But recently I've played through the first game and Miles just doesn't step even close to it. Miles Morales is an amazing experience but it is outshined by the previous game. Obviously the swinging and the graphics are far better but the story of Spider-Man ps4 is untouchable. And that's okay, Miles Morales was never trying to be better than peter the game wasn't supposed to be a sequel, Its a spin off. We can't expect a big world breaking event from miles' first year (and first week) solo spider-manning. Great game though would recommend"
528,Tsharris1,"Nov 18, 2020",6,"Spiderman, Miles Morales, Is a game that is very conflicting for me to talk about, especially in comparison to its predecessor. The one big problem with this game it’s the length, I was able to finish the story in 7 hours while doing several sidequests. In comparison to Spiderman(2018), Miles morales feels more like an extended DLC as opposed to a game worthy of even a reduced $50 price tag. However, I found myself enjoying the story more than the base spider man despite its length. The improved combat and web swing also makes this a great spiderman game and a great swing into the next generation of game consoles, even with its flaws and shortcomings."
529,TheDarknessDev,"Nov 18, 2020",10,Incredible experience! Fidelity mode is awesome but I had to switch to performance mode half way through to performance mode to overcome some of the harder boss fights. You just can't beat 60FPS....Great writing and I absolutely loved the ending!! Definitely worth the money.
530,epicsansun,"Nov 19, 2020",8,"Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a sequel, simple as that. There are so many new mechanics added to the combat that I can't consider it anything else. But there is one thing holding it back from reaching it's fullest potential; the length. The length often left me underwhelmed and wishing they did more with the amazing (pun intended) new combat mechanics. The few boss fights that are here are fantastic, but there are way too few of them. Ultimately this game does a lot right but feels too rushed and can't explore the full potential of it's mechanics and characters."
531,DanCooke,"Nov 19, 2020",10,"Spider-man Miles Morales is one of the most heart felt, character driven games I have even played. So much heart and love for the characters and when you combine this with an incredible soundtrack it really does make for an amazing game.The way the music fits with the plot is incredible, if you listen to the lyrics you will really see that they are almost a reflection of the plot. I would say it is an absolute must buy. I actually enjoyed it more that than 2018's spider-man which was also an incredible game. The Web swinging and action never seem to bore in this game and is extremely fluid."

533,CHolder14,"Nov 20, 2020",9,"This game expands on its prequel superbly, from storyline to gameplay. With most fighting animations and web slinging being the same or near enough similar to the previous instalment I came into the game shocked to see just how much the venum attacks changed and enhanced gameplay, I would be in awe of the venum and new finisher animations. The story line was engaging and emotional at times, however I believe the storyline was far too short, it felt as though I had raced through the game at 500mph. This led me to not fee as emotionally invested in the characters and their back story as much as I was in the original, Miles and Phins backstory felt rushed and paper thin. This was easily worth the money and so much more."

540,KingKabeca,"Sep 21, 2021",8,"É um jogo curto, mas pra quem estava esperando algo de nova geração é uma boa pedida, fluidez da nova geração e elementos como o ray tracing espalhados pela cidade toda, porém no quesito gameplay se torna um pouco repetitivo mas pra quem gosta do gênero é um bom jogo, assim como outros games, recomendo se estiver em promoção, a história principalmente vc termina em 12h dividindo entre exploração história e side quest, quem busca platina pode ter algumas horas a mais de diversão"
541,Veelights,"Nov 24, 2020",7,I went into Spider-Man: Miles Morales with both superhero movie and open world game fatigue and while those feelings remain intact I will attest to enjoying it quite a bit if not more than it’s lengthier predecessor.  While most of the first outings wrinkles have been ironed out technically the game still feels bogged down with collectathons and sprinkled with uninspired boss encounters. I feel that if they had spent less time on making it feel like an open world game and instead focused those efforts into giving it a fuller campaign this would have been a real contender for game of the year. For now however its the best Spider-Man game I have ever played. Which is pretty gosh darn good if you ask me. The new “Venom  Powers” are an absolute delight to use as different enemies and situations call for different combinations of these electrified area attacks. The gadgets make the game really easy but they are fun to use and pack a flourish that is a feast for the eyes most of the time. There is a flow to the gameplay sometimes that feels perpetual and ultimately very satisfying. I would recommend this game to both Spider-Man fans and Action game fans alike.
542,aelsv,"Nov 24, 2020",8,Nice game! Had a lot of fun. Graphics on PS5 is JUST AMAZING! You will definitely love this game if purchase for yourself!
543,Mobbu,"Nov 24, 2020",9,"Really good game that can live up to the original, not as lengthy thought, if you only do the main quests you can finish it in like 3 hours which is a little bit underwealming thought i fully enjoyed the game and i event 100% it, if you do everything it would take you around 10-15 hours. In conclusion is a good game go out and buy it or rather download it."
544,awesomeperson6,"Dec 18, 2020",7,"Not as good as the original, but still a fun game. My only complaints are that it’s short with around 8 hours of gameplay and it doesn’t have much replay value"
545,Axecutterx,"Nov 28, 2020",9,This game is 6 hours of interesting gameplay . I wrote 9 because some moments were so boring
546,Van47,"Nov 30, 2020",10,"It is  good game (I scored 10 -really it is an 8- just to counteract the zeroes), more of the same Spider-Man with new powers. Most of the 0 scores here are people that cannot even spell correctly and they get an aneurysm for seeing a mixed-race kid being Spider-Man, just man-childs being man-childs."
547,darinho,"Jul 28, 2021",9,"Could have given a 10, but only because of woke, PC and political stuff a solid 9. No need for character to say 5 times that it is gay (lesbian). We got it from the first time she said it. Also, BLM? Really? That leftist communist organization? Why? Why that in a game? These radical communist left ideology is really going full mainstream. Even in games. Even with those woke and rather stupid things, the game is great! Morales is a great character, game play is awesome, so fluent on PS5, combat is never boring.Story is only 5-10 hours, with all side missions maybe 15 hours. Can’t wait for Spider-Man 2."
548,alonehub,"Dec  1, 2020",9,"Improves on Marvel's Spider-Man with stunning visuals (mind-blowing on PS5 performance mode), new abilities, and snappier puzzles. The game is short, yes, but it cuts out missions that people didn't really like in the previous game, like Mary Jane's investigative detours. It's also a nice length for casual gamers who are sick of open-world bloat— like the Assassin's Creed franchise— and I was able to 100% it in around 13 hours. Miles is a compelling character and I loved the focus on Harlem and its people. Spider-Man is no longer just about a web-slinger fighting villains of the week, but a hero looking out for the people of New York, the people who need it, and Miles provides a perfect opportunity for this. He helps out the working class, bodega owners, health-workers, people with disabilities— the diversity in this game is great. The game is a great addition to the growing Spider-Man Playstation franchise and I can't wait to play more."

Por exemplo as habilidades, eu só precisei de melhorar as habilidades no final do jogo pois elas são muito razas, não servem para quase nada. A gameplay é super repetitiva que quase parece uma dlc do último jogo e a história é boa mas previsível, pois eu no início do jogo quase que consegui advinhar todos os vilões com base na forma como os vilões eram apresentados no jogo passado."

555,o0LaffyTaffy0o,"Dec  9, 2020",7,"This game is great. I like the side quests and tempo. Graphics look next Gen and gameplay is smooth. Venom strike was a step up from the 2018 Spiderman. Minus points for blatantly putting a political message in a game. Not advocating for or against BLM, but can we please agree to keep politics out of games? It ostricizes part of an audience who may not agree with a particular movement. It's political messaging like this that just lost Last of Us 2 Goty. Keep that crap on Twit **** and off my TV."

557,isocano,"Dec  8, 2020",7,"Sin duda es una experiencia que va de más a menos, me he decido por un 7 de nota final, en gran parte al gran inicio del juego, con una primera hora y media con un ritmo perfecto, unas cinemáticas increíbles, detalles espectaculares, música que acompaña perfectamente y en definitiva un juego de 10 que después pasa a ser otra cosa. Cuando pasamos la introducción, el juego realmente dura un par de horas, en el sentido de que todo es igual hasta el final. Misiones repetitivas, e historias muy planas, incluida la principal, que es exageradamente previsible en todos los aspectos. Apuntar que los coleccionables son también en exceso aburridos, además de que se meten con un calzador gigante a nivel historia, no me convencen. Un punto positivo es la duración de la historia principal, con una ambición contenida, el juego lo puedes disfrutar en un fin de semana con total tranquilidad, viendo esos reflejos nuevos, que son la nota positiva y agradable para el inicio de generación. En definitiva, un 7 gracias a sus mejores momentos, que podría haber sido bastante mas de haber mantenido el ritmo durante mas tiempo. Para iniciar la generación o para disfrutar un fin de semana, es una gran opción."
558,Myxth,"Jan  5, 2021",5,Great gameplay and an engaging story similar to the first game. However the price does not justify the measly length of the game. Wait for the game to go on a 50%+ sale before purchasing.
559,DadeCountyRange,"Dec 11, 2020",10,amazing game love the first game and this game is has amazing story and gameplay just a great and fun game no liew
560,bonorO,"Dec 11, 2020",10,"Spiderman Miles Morales é um jogo que me surpreendeu muito, não só pelo seu gráfico lindo mas também por sua história, Plot Twist e enredo cativante. E o desfecho foi oque mais me deixou perplexo na obra. Os controles são bons, animações dos personagens também são de morrer."
561,GamesGodMaster,"Dec 11, 2020",5,"Good game, but unfortunately has many bugs. In addition, the story is very predictable. Gameplay is no different from the previous part. I enjoyed the game, but nothing else. I suggest you buy this game for some promotions because unfortunately it is not worth the full amount."
562,Monito09aldo,"Dec 12, 2020",10,"A fantastic follow up to Marvel’s Spider-Man, even better in some aspects. A perfectly short, yet powerful story and the same smooth gameplay from the first game. A must play for PS5 and PS4 players."

564,Coochielover,"Dec 12, 2020",10,"Great story and terrific graphics. Insomniac deserves an applaud for its release of the game. While the story is short, the pacing is excellent. No MJ stealth missions, Just an all action packed game. The game took me 20 hours to get 100 percent completion in all districts. In terms of graphics, it is stunning. Very high level of detail on textures and miles face and suits. The environment looks great especially with the ray traced reflections which I have spent hours just at awe of the beauty. This is my favourite game of 2020 edging out GoT and TLOU2."

Like really to me it is the very high jump (because i've owned a PS3 for a long time). Also finally there's a Performance Mode, which is really smooth.Plot-wise: The plot was short, yet specific. Liked that.The only con is probably that i've discovered a bug while ago, where after using Mega Venom Blast on 8 Underground enemies, the game crashed, but that happened weeks ago.This deserves a solid 10."

569,Youngapollo22,"Dec 15, 2020",7,"Great game, same gameplay and map as the first. I would say this game is worth $25-$30 based on the content it has, not $50. The ending was very good but the overall story was somewhat predictable besides the end.  Way too much stealth for my liking.  Stealth in this game is not very fun to me compared to something like the Arkham series.  However, if you liked the stealth from the first spider-man game, you’ll love this."
570,Cacau-05,"Jan 11, 2021",10,"I don't believe that game deserve a bad score due to be a short game. The game, in my opinion is a good way to show and present Miles Morales and his drama to Spider-Man franchise. Excellent in graphics, narrative, gameplay, sound track, direction and free of bugs. The game is obligatory to PS owners. Give a bad score because it's a short game, please don't do this."
571,Joe340,"Dec 24, 2020",7,"70 dollars... For 7 hours... This is just crazy, i will pay 60 dollars for 9 hours but this is just crazy, i don't get it."
572,Siegfried86,"Mar 29, 2021",8,"This is an odd one to rate.  As far as gameplay goes, 10/10.  It picks up right where the original left off and advances things in interesting news ways with Miles’ venom powers.  Unfortunately, it also has to be noted that this is definitely not as full a game as the original.  It’s worthwhile on it’s own, and if it didn’t have to stand next to its big brother, it wouldn’t bother me a bit.  But it does stand next to it.  There are only a handful of meaningful boss fights and a more limited story, the rogues gallery is cut down to 3, and you only have two primary and one minor gang to worry about.  The city is there and it’s beautiful, but the scope of the game is noticeably smaller.  However, it also deserves mentioning that there’s little filler compared to th original and I think it benefits from that.  Side missions can be finished and collectibles rounded up before they wear out their welcome, and this is one of the first games in a while where I collected everything before I started yawning and decided to push on to the final mission.  Should it be full priced?  Maybe not.  But it’s a great game with an incredible vibe, and it’s an easy pickup once the price drops from retail.you just might not get as much time out of it as you expected, from the size of the first."

575,T_leaf,"Dec 30, 2020",7,"Game was fun, but I expected more. I really enjoyed the original Spider-Man game and this was more of the same. I had expected a major step up from the first game, especially considering the console generation jump but this game failed to utilize the features of the PS5 in any memorable way. I had also hoped for a longer experience, this game was very short and given the price of this game, although not a full-priced game still felt as though I did not get my money's worth. If you liked the first game, you will like this one too, but do not expect anything different, and wait for a sale!"
576,LivngWater,"Dec 30, 2020",9,"“Good things come in small packages.” Often some of the best treasures are found in the smallest places. That’s the way one feels after completing Spider-Man Miles Morales. An outstanding game, filled with heart, great storytelling, entertaining missions and just enough gameplay to keep you locked in. By the end, I simply wanted more! The great:The game is without a doubt a stand-alone superstar for the Spider-Man franchise. The character introduction and development is outstandingly engrossing. This game beats its predecessors with new combat and skills. The side-mission app: Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man was unique and enjoyable. However, it would have been better if after competing the missions on the app more were added. The good:By the end of the main story the player has found themselves walking off a rollercoaster of ethical considerations. Motives aren’t always pure, and often we’re left to examine the whole picture without making snap overarching judgments of people and their lives. The player will find themselves disliking characters in one moment to sympathizing with their intents in the next. I enjoyed the rises, falls, and sacrifices of the main characters. The bad: Nothing really “bad” here, it’s an awesome game and should interest a wide range of gamers. However, if I had to pick one thing it would be as with the previous Spider-Man some of the side missions and crime-stopping grinding gets repetitive and boring. But the new combat system made up for the monotony with the wide range of abilities."
577,rdx73,"Dec 31, 2020",5,"[very mild spoiler] Pathetic. Not only does it seem short (I'm not far in, but the % complete is going up quickly) with lack of variety in the fights but it actually seems like half a game. You jump into the middle. There is no ""start"" where you have a few small battles Instead you ""learn"" combat with a mini boss fight that is pointless because you just really mash buttons then do what it tells you when you suddenly get electrical powers and the next fight is immediately after your first training sim with several bad guys plus your sim turning on you and the techniques you just learnt don't work well (web snatching weapons - you need to target perfectly with no targeting or you might just grab a nearby enemy with no weapon and shake him/her a bit). This is a tough fight if you are trying to use the techniques you just learnt. The only way to easily beat them is to use basic button mashing and running away which does not help you improve for future fights. This only gets worse, you are suddenly faced with a lot of enemies at times. I imagine if you have the original Spider Man (I don't; wife bought me this for Christmas) this might not be a problem, but this is not a stand-alone game. It is DLC for that. Pretty graphics though."
578,PS5PCOWNER,"Jan  2, 2021",10,"I played this game for 20 hours; and will still go back to play more of it. Such a fantastic game I liked it more than I liked Spiderman remastered (I did not finish it on my brother ps4 because he got married and left the house, and took it with him). Insomniac did a fantastic job in terms of visuals in this game, a true next-gen experience with that 60fps raytracing glory. Highly recommend buying the Spiderman unlimited edition if you did not play the first spiderman on the ps4."

584,kimrinbray,"Jan 31, 2021",8,"It is deceptively much shorter and lacking in story and emotional elements then it’s predecessor, but what we get is still an enjoyable and fun little game to play to keep people at bay waiting for Spider-Man 2. (The load times are the best part)"
585,Trecrossover,"Feb  1, 2021",9,it had a good feel good appeal especially for fans of spiderman its like where they left off with a Bang. It shows miles side of his story that wasn't captured and leaves off with a cliffhanger. Game play is smooth and very similar to the first one with different gadgets and combat. I wish it was longer I would give it a 10.
586,MarleyW,"Mar  8, 2021",8,"Arguably the second best release game of the console launch after Demon’s Souls. Great visuals with a more refined swinging system than the first, while excluding to have any of the annoying unskippable MJ missions. However, It’s very short for a $50 price tag."
587,SergioPinto,"Feb  5, 2021",9,"Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a faithful installment to its successful predecessor, Marvel's Spider-Man. The gameplay is as good as the first game's, if not better with the addition of Venom attacks. I especially enjoyed how different it feels to control Miles when compared to Peter Parker, which makes sense seeing as they're different characters. The campaign, although noticeably shorter, packs a lot of value and emotions, just as the first game did. Even though this isn't a perfect game, it's still a very good one and helps solidify Insomniac Games as one of the best games development studios in the World nowadays. It's evident how much care and attention is put into this game."

589,PillowsCoolside,"Feb  6, 2021",9,"Would have given it a 10 but it was too short.  The game is extremely fun with a nice soundtrack,  graphics,  and story. I didn't play the first game so I have no comment about how it may be a copy or just an expansion pack.  As a stand alone game it was great if you have never played the first game."
590,Aidanfitz,"Feb  7, 2021",8,"It's a great game, just very short. Really felt like I was finished after no time at all. I liked its efforts to show a diverse population. The gameplay is the same as the first game, and handles very well. Nice storyline, and fun side missions. The only negative in the whole game really is how short it is."
591,Frankman82,"Feb  7, 2021",7,"It's a good beat em up but considering all the hype I was expecting a lot better. Longevity is soo bad it can be completed in 3-4 days... Frame rate is good, graphic is alright but the PS5 can do a lot more. I wouldn't buy at full price"
592,MortalRide,"Jul 11, 2021",8,"Miles Morales is a good game. Miles' combat mechanic is different than Peter's. Also it's web swinging animations are more enjoyable. The game's story is sufficient for it's play time. But overall the game is short. It needs more content like Peter's. Also, even though the combat mechanics are good player wants more options for combat like we had with Peter. This game's more impressive part is the Fidelity, Performance and Performance RT modes. This game has ray tracing and it uses that effectively. I started playing with Fidelity Mode which is Native 4K, 30 fps with Ray Tracing. I really enjoyed it. After i finished the game, i tried the Performance and Performance RT modes while i am trying to get the Platinum Trophy. I think you should have two options. Fidelity mode for who wants the best details for anything and Performance RT mode for who wants the good details with 60 fps performance. I think Performance mode shouldnt be an option for who plays this game."

594,tymqe,"Feb 23, 2021",8,"It is a good game but too short for its price, it took me around 20 hours to complete the main story and most of side missions.. Although there aren't many new features compared to the first Spiderman PS4 game, i had a lot of fun playing it."
595,Kelanaar,"Feb 23, 2021",5,"So this game is really short. I started it a few days back, and I already ended it while I just played it at night for a few hours. Also there were some points where the game became super boring and I fell asleep (more than once). The story is basically good, but it all feels like a bigger DLC for the previous game. Spider-man: Miles Morales DLC. They just reskined the 2018 game for a winter theme, threw in some new animations + RT and that's it. Fewer skills, fewer challenges, fewer gadgets ( 4 to be exact...) no suit powers (you have visors instead)...Stealth surely improved, and I like the tricks you can do while you swing, but that's just not enough.I played the 2018 Spider-man for the third time before this, and I can't tell how much I still loved it. The story is more complex and not too predictable compared  to this. If you want to buy this, wait for a discount because it's not worth to pay a full price imho. Also I tried it on PS5 and I didn't really feel like it's using the full potential of the haptic feedback of the controller or anything. Obviously the configuration of the PS5 is more than enough for this game. (nonetheless the game looks good, but just slightly better to it's predecessor.)"
596,thepablossj,"Mar  1, 2021",0,"La historia me parecio normal tirandole a bien y hasta ahi en cuanto al contenido de mundo abierto las misiones secundarias me parecio bien pero las cantidad de zonas de enemigos para completar me parecio algo escaza, los entrenamientos me parecieron bien pero mas cantidad y tal vez un poco mas de dificultad, en cuanto a la historia principal esta bastante corta unas 2-3 horas no estaria nada mal en cuanto al gameplay los poderes que tiene Miles lo de la bioelectricidad y el volverse invisible le dan un plus bastante bueno a la manera de hacer combos (respecto al Marvel's Spider-Man 2018). Aunque no se como igualaran esta diferencia de combos en la secuela ya que seguramente vamos a poder usar a ambos Spider-Man. Un juego algo corto pero disfrutable lo recomiendo al precio de $50 US si eres fan del personaje si no lo eres te recomendaria que esperaras a que bajara de precio a unos $30 - $20 US si es que te gustan los superheroes, mundos abiertos, accion y aventura aunque si lo compras aun mas barato mucho mejor en cualquier caso."
597,wmdsthlm,"Mar  1, 2021",5,"Spider-Man Miles Morales is beautiful and takes advantage of the Dualsense capabilities really well.  However was horrendously short in my opinion and becoming hard to justify the price.  The bugs when asked to select triangle makes my gaming experience feel like a chore more than something I'd be wanting to finish.  I wanted to finish the game purely because I paid full price for it.  To Insomniac it is not a secret that your studio can make incredible games, this one felt lackluster but I am still going to be a customer and very much eager to see Spider-Man 2 which I am extremely passionate and optimistic for.  Keep working hard on that game!"
598,lemonjuice17,"Jul 16, 2021",10,Completed all the Save Files 100 percent. What a great game. From the characters to perfecting the combat from the first game.
599,DerPilz,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"I know its a very short game but on the other hand its not a big problem. What I most hate about long games is that (mostly) a third of the missions are trash. But in normal 20-30 hour games the same problem can be found often too.In this 7-10 hour game i continuously had fun.The graphics on the ps5 are amazing and all the skins look beautiful(My favourites are the track,The End, and Bodegas cat suit).It features the Dual-sense really good.the story is really emotional and not a detective story like in the previous game.I can recommend this game to everyone who also is able do side-missions and not stops after beating the main-story."
600,Wboy2006,"Mar 15, 2021",9,"I don't get the hate, it is short, but the story is satisfying and if you go for the platinum. It is a great experience. It is shorter then the original 2018 game. But it doesn't matter because if you buy the ultimate edition (with the 2018 remaster) which is 70 bucks. Then you get 2 games and you only pay 35 dollars per game. It is overrated, and do NOT be turned away by haters. The combat is better, and the story is still awesome. And the character of miles is compelling."
601,Soupplate,"Mar 18, 2021",8,"Easily some of the most fun I've had playing anything on PS5, and it's a shame 100%ing it took less than 12 hours. It's a step-up from the first Spiderman title in nearly every regard, and Miles Morales is a charming, endearing new hero to control. If you haven't played the first game, the $70 bundle for both is solid value, otherwise I'd wait for sale. Worth your time"

But as mentioned it felt more like a standalone DLC, comparable to Uncharted's Lost Legacy which was cheaper in price."
624,OleMannLogan,"May 25, 2021",9,"Honestly I love the story with Miles more so than with Peter. This game has a lot of heart in it that keeps you engaged and wanting to play. The complaints about it being short I understand, as if you just rushed from main mission to main mission the game is only around four hours long. But with all the side missions and activities that are fun to complete, the game easily sat at 12 hours on my first playthrough. Insomniac also did a fantastic job with how this game looks and runs on the PS5. Would hands down recommend to anyone that is new to the PS5 family."

630,Uniqueyussy,"Jul 18, 2021",8,"Marvel-Spider-man Miles Morales is a visual spectacle and for what it is worth, it's great. The scope of this game wasn't meant to be big, it was more of an expansion so wasn't meant to be a phenomenal game, however it shocked many reviewers.The Gameplay felt so much smoother than the previous Marvel Spiderman on the PS4, likely due to the superior mechanics encompassed in the Dualsense controller, and additionally, Miles has a variety of different attacks, including the Venom punch, venom smash and more. All these different attacks compliment each other and manifest to create a very strong combat system.The critically acclaimed Marvel Spider-man on the PS4 did have a few flaws, one being the repetitive missions and crimes; Miles Morales has truly improved upon this, adding innovative side missions in a wintery New York which leads to the next point: the graphics.This game on PS5 is gorgeous, the fidelity mode offers a native 4k resolution with reflections, ray-tracing and enhanced lighting effects and personally, this was the best mode. The performance mode and the Performance RT mode were more smooth with the higher frame rates but lacked the native 4k resolution and the other enhanced effects.The story was, again, good for what it was worth; it made the gamer resonate with the characters and the bonds created were very well crafted. Although, some parts were definitely rushed a bit. The game was on the short side, about 7 hours if you wanted to just blast through the story but the extensive activities around New York really added another layer to the game. Miles Morales was never expected to be a masterpiece and it delivered well in what it promised, innovative, non-repetitive combat, excellent web-swinging, great graphics, plenty of fun side missions and collectibles, but the pacing of the story did not help the game and some mechanics were not fully fleshed out., this is not to undermine how good the story was, some of it was truly amazing. Overall, a solid 8/10"

633,RoneZoneTV,"Jul 28, 2021",9,While this game is much shorter than the previous title it does something I didn’t really expect. It somehow manages to separate Peter from miles in good ways they play similar but you can feel the difference. The story was okay and they improved on the combat and we swinging in fun ways
634,NerdGaming,"Jul 14, 2021",8,"Ich fan das Spiel wirklich nicht schlecht, ich habe mir das Spiel zu meiner PS5 für 25€ geholt und für das Geld hat es sich wirklich gelohnt, die Story ist leider sehr vorhersehbar, trotzdem aber sehr gut inszeniert und auch der Dualsense ist sehr gut integriert.Wer Spider-Man auf der PS4 mag, wird auch dieses Spiel mögen, auch wenn es sich leider zu wenig von seinem Vorgänger hervorhebt.-NerdGaming"

636,Helmspire_Gugli,"Aug 15, 2021",9,"Many users complained about this spin off's lenght without realizing its the whole purpose of this experience.Spiderman Miles Morales aims to improve the original game's mechanics within a limited game time span, while delivering a more dense and tight narrative, despite it being a bit weaker than the original's, even with an ending that is just as much emotional and impactful.What really makes this game shine is its  much more dynamic combat, which offers way More variety in terms of combo creativity and tactial choices. One note I would like to underline is that even at spectacular difficulty this game kept me on my toes way more efficiently than Marvel's Spiderman on ps4 did, and that is a BIG plus in my book.If you add all of this to impeccable 60fps with ray tracing and a much more fun traversal system that lets you express your creativity with tony hawk-like tricks while airborne, this whole package is undeniably a better experience than its predecessor (looking at you Mary Jane stealth sessions) I couldnt have asked for a better start for this promising generation, way to go Insomniac!"
637,Jomesinn,"Aug  7, 2021",8,"It is a good game don't get me wrong, but the length is only around 6 hours and it feels like dlc. You should definitely pick it up but play the first one, which is better first."
638,Ashrocker,"Aug 15, 2021",7,"For starters, the game is ridiculously too short. It clearly started as either an expansion to the first one that they repackaged as it's own game, or a rushed sequel that was cut way short in order to have a system seller for the PS5. On top of it being short, the story is also boring and predictable. I don't know if these characters are pulled from the comics, but compared to the first game, they are just....not good. Also, the wokeness is very real and very cringey. The seemingly out of nowhere, and ham-fisted, political scenes made me wonder how all the characters know that this Spider-Man is black. Is it because he wears a black costume? That seems rather racist. My only other criticism, and I know it's just a product of the world we live in now, is that it makes no sense that in a universe where Peter Parker is still alive and a mentor to Miles, that Miles calls himself Spider-Man. The game even seems to be aware of this, because there are numerous clumsy lines of dialogue trying to differentiate which Spider-Man a character is talking about. It would be the equivalent of having a Batman game where after Bruce trains up Dick Grayson, gives him his own bat suit, and then they just both call themselves Batman. It is unnecessarily confusing and stupid. Before I get into the game's strengths, it's important to point out that I loved the first game. In fact, it's the first and only game I've every platinumed. I played through it multiple times, beat it on the highest difficulty setting, and completed 100% of the DLC. Going into Miles Morales: Spiderman, I was worried that it would be too easy or feel too much like the original. I was wrong on both accounts. This game kicked my butt at first, and it was so much fun to learn all of Miles' new moves and unlock his new gadgets. I still think the fighting hologram gadget is lame, but everything else was a blast. I also really loved the fact that there were no forced stealth sections where you didn't play as Spider-Man or lame mini games that you have to do a dozen times. That alone was the biggest improvement over the first game. Speaking of improvements, this game looks, sounds, and feels way better.  It's clear that the developers really loved the first game they made and wanted to make everything feel familiar but better.  Also, the load times are amazing.  The sad truth is that if you were to take the characters and story of the first game and combine that with everything else from this game, it would probably be the perfect Spider-Man game. If you never played the first one, then the ""Ultimate Launch Edition"" is an easy recommend, since it comes with the first game remastered. If you've already played the first game and not interested in playing the remaster, than I would not recommend this one at full price. Wait for a sale."

643,Filander,"Sep 15, 2021",8,"Jogo muito bom, com ótimo gráfico, enrredo, e jogabilidade. No PS5 jogar a 60 FPS com Ray Tracing é fantástico. Porém o jogo é muito curto e inovou pouco em relação ao anterior."

645,Bendeagle,"Sep 21, 2021",9,The game is very similar to Spiderman 2018 but with some improvements. If you liked the game in 2018 you will like this one!

647,konjakthesober,"Sep 28, 2021",9,If you liked the spiderman game from 2018 you will like this one. The only thing for me that keeps it from a 10 is that it´s a litle short. Sure it was not full price but I much rather pay more for this to be a full game.
648,DinoWellCrisis,"Sep 23, 2021",8,"Spiderman Miles Morales, and a game as good as the first in the franchise, I believed it would be short to be dealing with Miles, as the spider this time, make no mistake the game is almost the same size as the first being a few hours ago the map and full of challenges has a very fun story opening doors for more games in the franchise a great Sony exclusive."
649,fadz13,"Sep 28, 2021",10,"Insomniac Games are GOATs, Miles Morales has a great Christmasy atmosphere and feel that I miss that makes it distinct from Spider-Man 2018 as well as Miles Morales abilities and distinct gameplay with his electric and invisibility powers."
650,ideafix13,"Oct  9, 2021",9,"I love those kind of games. The story is amazing despite some combats are similar. But the parkour is simply amazing. I love NYC and I love to swing all across the city. Thank you, my dear and beloved neighbor Spiderman."
651,Adriadt,"Oct 10, 2021",5,"Buenas, es un juego ideal para la nueva generación de PS5, donde se aprecia perfectamente la carga rápida, gráficos a 60hz, ray-tracing, y muy bien optimizado. En general un buen punto de inicio para la nueva generación de PS5. Disfrutadlo!!"
652,hdmintroduce,"Oct 12, 2021",9,"better than what any of these troll accounts are saying. Great characters, great side missions, great story, great combat, great music, great graphics. Highly recommend it especially if you're a spiderman fan. Just keep in mind it's a spinoff and shorter. Take you're time and savor it.P.S there's a payoff at the end of the story for side missions so do them in between the main missions and before the ending."
