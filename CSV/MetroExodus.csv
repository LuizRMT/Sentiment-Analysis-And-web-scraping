0,Esthete,"Mar 12, 2019",7,"For 4A Games: Сильные стороны Metro Exodus сюжет, атмосфера и несколько интересных персонажей. Но все портят bugs, lags, low fps, как будто бета. Вы, вероятно, потратили много времени, чтобы добавить RTX by Huang, но при этом забыли, что в 2K19 нужна нормальная анимация персонажей и их лиц. Нужна оптимизация, которой нет. Gameplay ужасен; AI глуп; физика оружия, повреждений и impact от оружия отсутствуют полностью. С другой стороны, оружие в игре ненужно, даже на рейнджере, кроме juggernauts, всех врагов можно либо прикладом либо кулаками, либо просто убежать, что ломает FPS сторону игры. Если играть не как пацифист, то игра будет винить тебя, попытка подражать Spec Ops the Line, но в Exodus мораль не работает. Сюжетные напарники Артёма, абсолютно бесполезны во время прохождения игры. Артём не умеет плавать - это минус. Exodus лишь имитирует open world. В версии для ПК так и не появилось нормального меню настроек, всё по СПАРТАнски, даже нельзя отдельно настроить громкость голосов и отдельно эффектов, которые часто заглушают голоса персонажей, теперь еще в меню нельзя отключить размытие, нужно лезть в config. Непонятно, чем Глуховскому и команде помешал Мельник. Два антирада, чем-то напомнило RE7, короче бред. Также непонятно, как имея аппарат для переливания крови, у команды не было элементарной свинцовой защиты у костюмов... список вот таких сюжетных недостатков можно продолжать. Немой Артём, при этом с ним переодически разговаривают NPC, иногда даже, что-то спрашивают, а Артём может только кряхтеть, кто это придумал? Если вы реально хотите когда-нибудь сделать замену Fallout или может быть даже шедевр, помимо того что ваша будущая игра, в техническом плане должна быть близка к идеалу, сюжет должен, по возможности, лишен даже мелких недостатков. Физика оружия, ориентируйтесь на сериию Battlefield; AI Exodus, полностью проигрывает Crysis (2007), также нужна процедурная система разрушения окружения. Неплохо было бы добавить RPG элементы, Metro это пошло бы на пользу, Артём должен говорить, иначе опять будет как в Exodus. Введите систему повреждений врагов и их разнообразие. Вот когда все это сделаете, тогда можно и open world. Хотя вряд ли Koch Media смогут вам выделить необходимый бюджет, для столь амбициозных планов. Может 4A Games скооперироваться с CDPR ;)For Deep Silver/Koch Media: Well, if you don't understand how AAA projects are made, maybe you better deal only with distribution? First controversial decision with the choice of digital store, then, seeing the incompleteness of the game you hastened devs. You were only interested in time frame and profitable cooperation with Epic Games. And instead of doing quality control you decide to shove into game f* Denuvo which doesn't protect the game from hacking but only causes inconvenience to your customers, instead of give 4A Games money to create high-quality animation, for example. Yeah, yeah, you can tell, that there is no difference in performance between the regular version and Denuvo version. Yes, no, but only in the PC for 3-5K $, and for everyone else there will be lags and low FPS. Looking at the list of games you have published, it becomes clear that, apart from the Metro series, you no longer have anything worthwhile, and you are so carelessly about your main franchise. You probably crazy."
1,Fire_Dragon,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"People, are you nuts? You give this game 0 and 1 just because of Epic Store? Without considering the game itself? This not developers blame! And not the game's blame for sure. The game itself is amazing! Perfect atmosphere, good story, interesting gameplay, wonderful world (and it is NOT an open world game, you idiots who complain about ""not-open-world"". Developers never said that it would be open). Of course this game has disadvantages, but its advantages overweight them. This is the best game of the Metro series and one of the best games in the world"
2,Streps,"Feb 16, 2019",5,"Yet another game released too early.  Far too many issues with instability and poor optimization.  Of what I have played of the game to date,  it is a very average experience.  It hasn't pushed into a new realm of innovation.  This game feels old, mostly due to the predictable development of the story, when you think something may happen, it does every single time.  Their is a massive lack of imagination with the crafting of the core game play, the way in which you interact with objects feels 15-20 years old.  One of the big issues, is the mediocre A.I.  This would be close to the worst A.I I have experienced in an FPS style game in 20 years.   The previous two games, are a far better experience than this. For what it offers, with its lack of innovation and poor game play, give this a big miss until its on sale foe $20. if this is a sign of things to come in 2019, then we are going to have a very poor year of games."

4,secretsw,"Feb 17, 2019",10,"Such a shame ppl giving it 0s because of Epic Store. You're only dooming the series, the developers and advanced graphics in future games. Metro is not an AAA game by a big rich studio, but a genuine effort by a passionate team that NEEDS your support. And boy the game is good. Unmatched visuals. Locations hand made with love, exploring feels amazing, it's just what Metro needed. Brilliant dialogues by the author of the book series. Nice story. Ultimate Slavic atmosphere. Great licensed songs. The only real drawback is its length: feels like it should've been 1.5 to 2 times bigger. It's NOT buggy, I have not come across any serious bugs throughout the entire game on day 1, the performance is great with my GTX 970. It's one of the most polished games at launch withing the last 5 years. Put a 10/10 to even those 0s as much as I can. ///Ваши нули за Эпик Стор - это позор. Вы не понимаете, что обрекаете ни в чём не виноватых разработчиков? Другой такой студии у нас нет, кто бы сделал ТАКОЙ славянский колорит (атмосфера лучше предыдущих игр), такую графику, которая будет свежо смотреться и через 5 лет. И сюжет отличный, и диалоги; в самой неприметной избушке детализация интерьера, как у бабушки в деревне; по радио крутят классику русского рока - это всё дорогого стоит. Геймплей шагнул далеко вперёд, свобода - именно то, чего Метро не хватало. На релизе игра вылизана, багов мало, GTX 970 тащит ультра пресет с физикой и волоснёй только так. А вы гордитесь, что у вас торрент эдишн. Было бы чем."
5,ATaXiA_,"Feb 16, 2019",2,"These game reviews shows how out of touch gaming journalism is with gamers.That aside the game itself is O.K, The story is much weaker than previous titles in the series with graphics to match. For an open world game it feels so empty and devoid of interesting places to find that is when the game isn't holding your hand and directing you along the main story.After playing Exodus for 8+ Hours it only left me wanting to play the earlier titles, it didn't meet or build upon the old games. The UI is garbage as is with most ports or games released on both consoles and PC, that is a given anymore. The graphics are 2 years behind along with the terrible animations and sound. The game rivals any Bethesda fallout game in terms of bugs. This feels like it needed a few more months to bake and come together. This feels like a misstep for 4A and the quality games they use to produce."
6,c66208,"Feb 15, 2019",4,"Metro: Exodus is a story driven shooter that has lost what made previous Metro games unique and now feels like a generic semi-open world shooter. Sure, the previous Metro games were linear shooters, but they put you in tight, claustrophobic quarters that had a certain atmosphere to them that Exodus can't seem to match in it's more expansive settings. The story is OK, but generally doesn't feel up to par with other metro games; as noted above, the atmosphere that made previous entrants feel special is missing. Exodus feels poorly optimized for PC but generally runs well on my admittedly beefy gaming PC, however, I've already encountered a game breaking save file bug that's forced me to restart from square one. I also feel like it's worth noting the only reason I have the game is because I pre-ordered it on Steam before it was pulled, If I hadn't already payed for the game I wouldn't be playing it because I don't want to support the fragmentation of the PC market with timed exclusives and I simply can't support the way Deep Silver is doing business with Epic Games. tl;dr: Overall, while not a bad game, it's not worth the current $50/$60 price tag. You would be far better served waiting for it to come back to steam and pick it up with it's DLC on a steep discount if you're a PC gamer. I would also suggest waiting or abstaining if you can to send a message to Deep Silver that the PC market won't stand for the sort of behavior that gets a pass in the console gaming world, there are plenty of games out from other publishers that respect their customers."
7,SuddenlyMorgan,"Feb 15, 2019",3,"I really want to like this game. I loved Last Light, but I feel like this game is ultimately a step down for me. The game runs terribly, even on a decent rig, and in the amount of time i've played, i've encountered several game breaking bugs. I don't even care about the epic store, but the state this game launched in is terrible!"
8,serega1md,"Feb 16, 2019",10,"В целом игра не хуже предыдущих частей , а то что неадекватные люди снижают оценку это не вина разработчиков ."
9,Xelluse,"Feb 15, 2019",2,"Graphics OK, but when at the same place you will see Hires and Lowres objects together, it just kills whole visual atmosphere of the game... This - Dirt In Your Face - effect is annoying... Also small rendering distance....Optimization sucks, many modern games show much better performance with much better Photo-gen visualization quality.Boring Open World. Can't understand why they even try to put this crap in the game, it was great action game, but now it's just a time-killer.Bad character design, sometimes it feels like you are playing some kind of Saints Row 4 or Borderlands and not a serious Post-apocalyptic game.Sounds are bad, game can't properly work with sound directions, also do not properly support anything above Stereo...Huge amount of bugs...Just Epic Games Store, not exactly a bad thing, but very uncomfortable, also game was Announced for Steam, then delayed, like they do not give a fk about their players. Game have nice story, graphics, Sometimes, show very nice views, but low rendering range, bad optimization and DIRTINDAFACE are killing whole this perspective, music is good (only good thing in this game), if not bad sound-works...So if you like games like Dear Esther, but with some grinding and some shooting, then you may like it, but at this state, this game is lower than median quality product... 2 Sponsored by Nvidia from 10"
10,Tibor,"Feb 15, 2019",2,"This has been a massive disappointment and frustration. There are numerous bugs and graphical glitches that plague this game. It is not ready to be released. The first bug is game breaking; after entering the first 'open' level, the game no longer recognises commands to fire weapons. This is inexplicable as the ability to shoot guns has worked for the first 3 hours of game play. Not being able to shoot weapons in a fist person shooter is ridiculous. Second; quick save is temperamental. Often upon launching the game, there is often no option to continue or load a previous save. This requires a restart of the PC for the game to recognise the save files. Third; the built in Photo Mode is broken and does not have a function to take screenshots Integration with NVIDIA Ansel is broken; you cannot take photos with Ansel in Metro Exodus Photo Mode. It works fine in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Appalling and absurd oversight and implementation. I am running this on an RTX2080; the graphics are some of the best I have ever seen but often the lighting on static objects like trees is utterly bizarre and flashes in and out, especially on the Train Hub levels. Characters have an aura around them that obscure Ray Traced reflections in water. Issues such as these immediately break the immersion that RTX and DLSS is supposed to enhance. The character writing and interactions are disinteresting, poorly voiced and too lengthy. The motivations of certain major characters are sometimes utterly unbelievable. The decision to make the game available on Epic Games has had the following specific drawbacks;- No ability to pre-install the almost 60 GB game file. Game was not available to download even at 1 am on 15 Feb 2019. Unacceptable!- No user forums to discuss and find solutions for common issues - having to resort to Steam General Discussion Forums.- No achievements, no cloud save, poor launcher supportThe decision of Deep Silver and 4A games to make their game exclusive to Epic Games must be criticised, as it has introduced these above consumer experience  issues for this title. I will likely not be buying another title from Epic Games Store until these issues are resolved. I have spent most of the day wrestling and trying to find solutions for this 'game'. Games are supposed to be fun to play. My experience today has been an utterly frustrating chore. It should not acceptable to launch any product in any market with such deficient functionality. Poor."
11,Blue_Slowpoke,"Feb 15, 2019",0,"The technical side:The game is very buggy at launch, it doesn't support my ultrawide monitor (in 2019!, really?) and I am playing in a vertical letterbox. I am also experiencing stutters on my GTX 1070ti. I know it's supposed to show off RTX series cards, but making a $1000+ card mandatory for decent gameplay is just retarded. The graphics:Uninspired improvements over the last Metro titles, the environment models at many instances feel hastily put together, it feels like the game was rushed. The game is also very very dark at many instances, it's supposedly done to showcase the RTX ray tracing, but if you don't have an RTX you can't see anything. Gameplay:Very, very buggy AI. NPCs generally don't tend to react to each other, NPCs getting stuck, NPCs doing nothing etc etc. There are too many flaws at this stage to describe, the game feels rushed, unfinished and incomplete. Not worth the money."
12,masterx1234,"Feb 16, 2019",1,"Where do I even begin, The Epic game launcher is absolutely horrible!! It crashes so often I thought there was something wrong with my PC. Not only that but you cant go offline!!!? I didnt even know that this was a limitation of the epic game launcher, It means that I cant play the game on my gaming laptop when in the RV, I travel a lot with my family and we dont always have WIFI constantly. So I cant even play a single player game I payed $60 for without internet, what an absolute joke. I am a long time fan of the previous 2 games. had an absolute blast with last light as its considered one of my most favorite games ever. But in Exodus It just doesnt have that same feel like the previous 2 games. First of all the FOV is really low and there is NO FOV SLIDER!. Yep you read that right, its 2019 and a FPS game on PC without an FOV slider. The default FOV is 60 and you will get horrible motion sickness from playing on your monitor, The game seems to be a straight up port from consoles, they didnt even put any work into the PC version. the movement feels super sluggish and heavy, mouse sensitivity can be maxed out and yet it still feels like you have 20 pounds of rocks holding your mouse down. And the open world feels so boring, half the time you run around looking for something to shoot or do, there just isnt anything going on to interest me while going from area to area. There is barely any underground sections like the older games, which was a staple in the Metro series and is in the freakin title of the game. Overall I cant recommend this, as pretty looking as it is, the game feels baron and the PC version is a lazy port from consoles."
13,el_pedrico3000,"Feb 19, 2019",4,"In order to forgive such a crooked animation and retarded dialogues, the game must be at least Skyrim level, seriously, the dialogs in the late ""metro"" fanfiction are better!The plot  level - Russian TV series in a bad sense of the word. And how was it possible to voice the game so badly? is it the mod for the half-life ? Standard slaps were used for the sound of the steps. Let's now sound ALL  monsters using ""Wilhelm scream"". AAA level game dubbed by punks in the basement. One actor voices all minor characters.Waited so long,  It turned out a demo of beautiful locations on postcards (artists, textureartists - respect, for that 4 ). Для того чтобы простить настолько кривую анимацию и дегенеративные диалоги, игра должна быть как минимум уровня скайрим, серьезно, диалоги в поздних фанфиках по метро - лучше!Сюжет уровня русских сериалов в плохом смысле этого слова. И как можно было так озвучить игру? это что мод для халфлайфа чтоли, где для звука шагов использовались стандартные шлепки, нет ну вы бы уж тогда и на вопли всех монстров ""крик Вильгельма"" прицепили, да ппц продукт вроде AAA переозвученный фаргусом и одним актером на всю массовку.Ждали, ждали а на выходе демка красивых локаций на открытки(художникам, текстурщикам респект, за это 4 бала)."
14,FlamingBullet,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"I finished the main campaign in about 15 hours and it was one of the best campaigns I have played in half a decade, The characters really suck you in and the graphics are some of the best i've ever seen, The only bug i've experienced is a graphical error in the tunnels around 85% completion"
15,Shaobell,"Feb 17, 2019",0,Game crashed 6 times in 73 min.Shi** epic store destroyed game.Open world? Ok... WHY SO EMPTY!?
16,DarkDoom,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"Игра отличная! Великолепная передача местной атмосферы! самая атмосферная игра из себе подобных. великолепный сюжет, достойный киноэкранизации. Отличная графика уровня 2018 года! Диалоге прописаны хорошо, заставляют и смеятся и плакать, так сказать.Минус только в физике, а именно в физике главного героя, нашего подопечного. Он, уак бы это сказать...., тупой, в плане ходьбы, прыжков, бега и прицеливания.Немного ""барахлит"" звук. Местами они не правдоподобные, местами не уместные. Нужен качественный звук и озвучка каких-либо движений для игры такого уровня.В остальном всё шик и блеск."
17,nonameforme,"Feb 15, 2019",0,"This game doesn't have FOV slider, and default at 60.Wut? What is this? Is this game made in 90' ???? TLDR: If you suffer Motion Sensitivity disease, do not buy this game. Saying that dynamic FOV will make the model look weird isn't a excuse, it's your job to make it work. Even when it doesn't work flawlessly, it's better to give customer the option like in Wolfenstein. In that game the dev know any FOV other than the default will make the cinematic look weird and make model glitch, but you know what? They still gave player the option to change it with the warning. This is like ordering 60$ burger as a person who are allergy to seafood, turnout it came with seashell as 'hidden flavor', and the shop refuse to change it into something else and just rob you blind."
18,Sergey_GG,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"Люди жалуются только на платформу и на большие системные требования. Таких дураков я ещё не видел. Вы оцениваете игру, а не Epic Games. А то что системные требование высокие это ваши проблемы, их сразу показали и вы знал на что шли. Если не идёт, обновляйте ПК. А игра именно то, чего я и ждал. Графика, гемплей, может не полный открытый, но это даже не особо там нужно. гра просто лучшая в своей серии и среди всех постапокалитческих игр."

22,marcus_wright,"Feb 15, 2019",0,"I'm afraid I'll have to give a 0 rating to this game. It shouldn't have been launched in this state. The Epic launcher crashed constanty while downloading the game and I had to reinstall both the launcher and game several times before finally getting them to run. Once inside the game it kept crashing after 4-5 minutes with some weird errors in either the launcher's executable or the game itself. At this point I'm done trying to troubleshoot this Epic failure of a game and launcher and I'm trying to request a refund. Getting the Epic Fail Store to give me the refund proves to be an adventure in itself. Their reps keep delaying with bull*hit copy/paste PR replies (about being impossible to get a refund so soon or even asking me to call the publisher...) From what I've been able to play so far the game looks average: looks like a un-optimized console port with quirky controlls, weird graphic glitches, random low res and low fps issues on a bloody RTX 2080 TI, and so on. This game really needs additional testing and shouldn't have been released in this state. I didn't want to be like those people who complain about the exclusivity thing but I never encountered such issues with the older Metro games I bought on Steam. I might buy it again but this time next year from Steam or GoG, once all the bugs are fixed and that crappy Denuvo thing is removed, assuming my I would still be interested in this game, but more likely I'll just watch a play-through on YouTube and be done with it. I really enjoyed the older games but this one left a sour taste..."

24,Gizilq,"Feb 15, 2019",1,"Оу май, Метакритик удаляет неугодные обзоры? Но мне не сложно, я повторю.Итак, игра плоха. В ней плохо почти все.1. ИИ очень странно себя ведет.2. Стелс здесь ужасен. Они просто перенесли систему из прошлых игр. Но там было метро и узкие пространства, а здесь ты стоишь днем в 1 метре от врага и он тебя не видит.3. Баги. Игра три раза крашнулась, несколько раз не сработали скрипты и пришлось откатываться к прошлому сейву. Много графических багов, вроде подвешенных в воздухе предметов.4. Открытый мир пустой. Там скучно.5. Сюжет очень банальный и не интересный.6. Очень плохо реализована стрельба._____________________________________________________________________________Google translation sorryOh my, does Metacritic remove bad reviews? But it's not difficult for me, I will repeat.So the game is bad. Almost everything is bad in it.1. AI behaves very strangely.2. Stealth is terrible here. They just moved the system from past games. But there was a subway and narrow spaces, and here you are standing in the afternoon at 1 meter from the enemy and he does not see you.3. Bugs. The game crashed three times, the scripts did not work several times and had to roll back to the past saves. There are a lot of graphic bugs, like objects suspended in the air.4. The open world is empty. Its boring there.5. The plot is very banal and not interesting.6. Shooting is very poorly implemented."
25,Deadheadbill,"Feb 15, 2019",0,A joke of a game compared to the previous ones. Semi-open world takes you by the hand whenever it wants to force you down a path. Unoptimized and runs very badly. Go back and replay Metro Last Light and you will have more fun.

27,Sura,"Feb 16, 2019",10,"Люди, которые пишут, что в игре нет атмосферы, нет сюжета, что она скучная и остальную подобную ересь....у меня к вам один вопрос....вы вообще здоровы или  вы настолько зажрались, что сами не знаете, чего хотите? Скорее всего, 80% поставленных негативных оценок и отзывов от тех, кто даже её не проходил, не говоря уже за то,чтобы они её покупали.  Да, определённо присутствуют некоторые технические минусы, но их поправят фиксами -- это однозначно. Те кто поливают Metro дерьмом из-за Steam вообще no comments.METRO EXODUS - не идеальна, но она настолько погружает в себя, настолько проникаешься атмосферой...такой родной, той -- которой так не хватает в остальных играх, той, которую так ждали...истории персонажей, диалоги вообще отдельная тема, там можно залипнуть  надолго и слушать не переставая и не уставая. Игра шикарна и за её колорит -- ей можно простить все её технические недочёты.Те кто говорит, что прошел игру за 4-6 часов....вы что спринтом пробежались по всем локам...да я больше,чем уверена,что спроси у вас о каких либо записях, о том, что случилось с тем или иным второстепенным персонажем и вы нихрена не сможете ответить ибо вы не знаете. Мой вердикт таков -- METRO EXODUS лучшая игра в которую мне доводилось в последние 2-3 года, несмотря ни на что. Последнее, во что я играла с таким интересом и с такими упоением -- это был Ведьмак 3 от CD Projekt RED.Ни грамма не сожалею о том,что мною была приобретена лицензионная версия данного продукта и таким образом я выказала благодарность разработчикам за их труд. Спасибо 4A Games за Ваш труд и отличную игру!"

Картинка интересная, но не айс, Заявленные hdr и трассировка лучей настолько сырые, что вау эффекта не получаешь. В целом шутер как шутер, ничего особенного, стоющих фишек нет. Тот же division 1, 2 как шутер и то интереснее за счет мультиплеера. Возможно при наличии мультиплеера игралось бы веселее, но как соло игра - не интересно. Школоте и любителям пиу-пиу, игра зайдет. Да и еще баги встречаются не критичные, но удовольствия мало. Можно было бы игре поставить оценку выше (бала 3-4), за счет красивых картинок, но  ннет, издатель наплевательски отнесся к PC пользователям из-за жадности, а коль так, то игра не достойна внимания..."

37,aberro,"Feb 18, 2019",6,"Actually, after several hours of gameplay, I've had to change my review into more positive. This game is quite good as for me (but I must agree that it's not for everyone). Developers have made unbelievable bad opening, filled with all and everything bad and bugged which this game have to offer - unsynced dialogues, jerky animations, lack of details, long, meaningless and pointless dialogues, crashes and system hangs... I've even beed banned on official discord channel for criticizing this game! Then asked for refund (WHICH WAS IGNORED BY EPIC STORE, YOU GUYS ARE WORST!)But once I've passed through opening into the open world - all that's stopped bothering me. Dialogues are still unsynced, but they are rare and I can go make some coffee while characters are blablablaing with mute protagonist pretending that he isn't mute, bugs are quite rare, I'm not forced into corridor shooter.Atmosphere of this game is very good, I like how shooting system works (and that I can disable all that cheaty aid systems, like hit markers), I like the game balance (though enemies are too easy for me on normal difficulty and resources are too scarse to change to higher difficulty level, but this is somewhat balances difficulty, I guess?), AI is quite comprehencive, I mostly like level design and overall I'm enjoying this game more than I've suffered in opening scenes.But still, thought this game is quite good, it can be waaaaaaaaaaaay better if only 4A had QA team or listened to them and polished it a little more. Like, make sure dialogues are synced with animations and other characters' dialogues, add some little details here and there, ensure that things which should stay on a table is actually staying on a table and not flying in plain air and so on. There is too many little glitches and imperfections, which looks like they've been made in a hurry and was ignored by devs (because they can't be unnoticed by QA), to give this game a better score.Oh, and I'll give -2 score points for EPIC STORE! You wanted more money ignoring and deceiving players in a last days before release - you take bad score."

44,MagusGW1,"Feb 15, 2019",3,"This Game feels watered down compared to Last Light and Metro 2033. Sure its open world now and not a linear tunnel, claustrophobic, frighting shooter. The real issue for me is that everything from the previous shooters in the series seems to have been removed. The mind games of the other beings that seems to mess with Artyom are pretty much nonexistent in this game or just seems like a side show. They made combat a lot easier with massive amounts of ammo and weps everywhere compared to the previous games as well. This game is VERY poorly optimized for PC as well. Low frame rates even with a GTX 1080 Ti a 8th gen i7 and 32 GB of ram. Many bugs seem to be in the game graphically as well. Also the fact that a week after i preorded it on Steam they pulled it from Steam was pretty much the last nail in the coffin for me. Epic games launcher is a god awful pile of trash with terrible security (I have been getting attempted login alerts since their massive security breach on my account.) it took them A MONTH to resolve the issue with my account and reset the password as well as add in Email authentication. Then they acted like pricks and dropped the price to 49.99 on the epic launcher. I would steer clear of this one. Good Luck"

70,DaemonXHUN,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"One of the best video games I've ever played. I play games for a very long time now and I completed nearly 700 games, including tons of FPS titles and it's definitely among the best (with the previous Metro titles, Bioshock games, etc.). The story arc is satisfying and emotionally impactful, the characters are loveable and you really care about them, while the bits and pieces of lore you can find in the world are interesting - although often sad. But in the main story, there's always hope, even in the darkest moments. The game is extremely immersive thanks to many different aspects. Similarly to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, this game doesn't hold your hand and respects your intelligence and there's a stellar level and gameplay design to support it. The core pillars - namely combat, exploration and survival - which are integral to the experience, work flawlessly together, each of them feel rewarding and satisfying, while the strong narrative helps to bond these things even closer together and elevate them to the next level. There are no pointless and meaningless fetch quests, every place in the world has its own story and there's a strong reason why you go to different places. Also, it's quite possibly the best looking game I've ever played (I played it on the absolute highest settings on PC, which are: Extreme Settings, Tesselation on, Advanced PhysX on, HairWorks on, 3440x1440p). Not just because its graphics, but because of its art design as well. If this game would have released on Steam and there wouldn't have been the Epic Store controversy, this game would have gotten 9/10 and 10/10 scores. It's a masterpiece."

86,Motoko_Kusanagi,"Feb 17, 2019",3,"Ставлю 3 бала только за красиво плескающуюся воду в стакане (Шикарная физика жидкости внутри емкости.), и за саундтрек. Композитор единственный кто старался при работе над игрой. Так это убогий однообразный шутер (И ни разу не шедевр.), с никакущей стрельбой (Ощущение от оружия, и система отображения повреждений дно.). Кучей гринда на более менее крупных (Примерно как в первом Crysis-Far Cry, хотя местные зоны чуть меньше.), но довольно пустынных локациях, практически полностью лишенных интересных мест. Из игры убрали систему торговли, исчезло ощущения опасности которое было при вылазках на поверхность (Оно достигалось, постоянной нехваткой воздуха, кучей тварей и прочих опасностей, которые приходилось преодолевать игроку. Тут же, можно тупо почти от всего убежать.), атмосфера с которой и так было туго ещё в предыдущей части, практически сошла на нет. Сюжетные миссии не блещут проработкой и оригинальностью, уровни с заброшенной станцией, библиотекой, первой вылазкой на поверхность, и останкино, в разы лучше всех миссий Exodus. Сюжет к слову, представляет из себя набор шизофренического, и жутко нелогичного русофобного бреда (Увы из за ограниченного объема рецензии, я не могу его описать.), с посредственными диалогами и персонажами, хотя погибшего Мельника (Несмотря на то что он старый маразматик.), всё же жаль, больше чем того же главного героя. Который опять молчит в процессе миссий, но при этом вовсю болтает на экранах загрузки, ""гениально""! Графика тоже не блещет, текстуры немногим лучше чем в предыдущей части, а детализация уровней оставляет желать лучшего. Ах да, обещанный Rtx глючное дерьмо, которое просто затемняет картинку. Однако малолетние, умственно отсталые русофобные фанатики Глуховского, всё равно будут доказывать что Metro Exodus это шедевр (Который они в силу ""большого ума"", уже ставят выше Stalker 2, который не представлен даже в виде скриншотов.), ни разу не русофобия, и вообще лучшая игра 2019 года. Здесь я привел лишь малую часть минусов Exodus, даже основные не влезут. До смешного, разработчики наивно полагают, что стражи сражающиеся с кикиморами, (Про Skyrim мир которого в 15 раз больше Exodus, где хищники охотились на травоядных, мы не слышали.), или лагеря бандитов с крафтом, действительно смогут кого то удивить. Ну ну. Лучше бы сюжет нормальный написали, да над миссиями поработали. P.s Те кто ставят 0 балов, только из за EpicStore, полные идиоты, торговая площадка никак не связана с реальными минусами игры, будь она хорошей, её можно было купить даже в Uplay. P.s.s Иронично что люди восторгающиеся такими проектами, возмущаются миссией в аэропорту из Mw 2, и сюжетной компанией Coh 2, данные игры хотя бы не создавались людьми из Снг, и в них не было такого градуса русофобии как здесь.

( и не дай бог если чекпоинт сработал после того как накрылся скрипт )- Просто ужасная орфография в субтитрах и записках (ошибка на ошибке), и это игра ААА?- Текстурные баги и баги AI, вылеты, зависания.- Стрельба и поведение оружия на уровне первых игр серии( и где тут прорыв как многие пишут не понятно)- Не говорящий Артем из GTA3 и HalfLife, для игры 2019 года это выглядит как то странно.- Зачем столько модификаций оружия если стрелять приходится пару раз за всю игру, и то толко там где дают пострелять. А в остальное время стелс стелс стелс...(и да!!! стелс перенесен из предыдущих частей и просто не работает на текущей концепции), не ну вы конечно может открыть огонь но это закончится загрузкой чекпоинта (если говорить про максимальный режим сложности).- Завышенные системные требования (мало что поменялось с предыдущих частей в графике, и да у меня GTX 1080)- От METRO осталось только название и первые 20 мин игры во вступление.- Про Steam... лично мое мнение - ее специально от туда выпилили что бы не схватить ""хейта"" от ужасного исполнения релизной части игры, т.к. все похоже на то что разработчик просто не успел доделать релиз и выпустил его сырым."

Но чего я никогда не смогу простить - это то, как разработчики наплевали в душу своим халтурным отношением к своему детищу. По количеству багов она наверное даже переплюнула легендарные Skyrim и Fallout 4. Метательный нож четко пролетевший сквозь противника, который стоял практически в упор, застревание намертво между листами остова старой баржи, висящие в воздухе сдающиеся противники, повисающее в воздухе оружие убитых врагов, дрожащие трупы в текстурах, вот еще далеко не полный список дерьма, что довелось увидеть. Ну и самым эпичным было, что когда захотелось утопится от всего этого увиденного - спрыгнув в море ГГ не захлебнулся, а просто ушел под воду, притом плавать его не научили, добро пожаловать в меню загрузки. Отдельного упоминания заслуживает геймплей, хочется зевать каждые 10 минут, герой передвигаясь на лодке не может надеть противогаз, заплывая в загазованную зону, тебе приходится встать в лодке, надеть противогаз и сновать сесть за управление лодкой. Фишка с протиранием противогаза - это безусловно плюс, вроде как реализм, но почему у вас тогда кровь с лобового стекла транспортного средства исчезает как по волшебству?!

HERE we note the VIDEO GAMES and not a support!When you go to the cinema, you will not say ""what a movie of sh.., it was too bad because my chair was not comfortable ...!""Otherwise the game is extraordinary except AI which is a bit badass.The open world does not break the rhythm, an incredible narrative, very good side quests that you can complete in different ways and a really memorable trip.I loved Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, and this one is even better and more complete, that's saying a lot!.Now I am even more impatient to have STALKER 2"

The story wasn't as enjoyable as previous entries either. Graphics are average by today's standards and the game has noticeable texture bugs throughout.The game just doesn't feel like a metro game. The linear game play, tight claustrophobic areas of the previous entries made Metro what it is and Metro Exodus doesn't come close to Metro or last light. Disappointing entry."

Довольно неплохой сюжет, хотя всю игру я еще не прошел, но первые 10 часов идут на Ура.2.Красивую картинку3....Из минусов:1. техническая составляющая игры, не редки баги2. оптимизация. моя система i5 7600k + 1070+16gb, играю на средне-высоких в фулл хд, на 100 не грузит как проц, так и видеокарта3.спорное решение с псевдо-открытым миром. Спорное потому, что на мой взгляд, метро брало своей атмосферой темных и линейных туннелей. Понятное дело, что тут совсем другое место действия, но мне кажется что из этого можно было что-то сделать. Уровень с Болотом из 34 части как пример4. и вот мы добрались до, пожалуй, основного пункта - ценовой политики издателя )К разрабам претензий нет, игра выполнена довольно качественно, хотя и не стал бы кидаться броскими заявлениями о том, что она якобы Лучшая в серии. Все технические баги можно будет еще подтянуть патчами. Но жадность издателя не изменить. Габен хоть и жиреет с своих 30% - это факт. Но убирать игру из продажи за 2 недели - неуважение к фанатам. Я думаю, что в полной мере могу считать себя фанатом серии, тк прошел каждую часть по 5-6 раз и прочел всю трилогию от корки до корки. А в момент анонса - искренне радовался. Но ситуация, что обросла вокруг этой игры огорчает мою терпкую душу простого смертного игрока, который может повлиять на решение больших боссов лишь негативным обзором и кошелем звонких монет"

Shows you the lengths people will go to in an attempt to make their largely unwarranted anger known. This game is great. The characters are all loveable in their own way, and I found myself caring about each and everyone of them greatly. The shooting mechanics are extremely satisfying, and whilst there may be open-world aspects to the game, it doesn't lose its claustrophobic atmosphere, and linear parts where they are needed. It's a breath of fresh air, and a great spin on the series, and while it is regrettable that the game had a fairly large controversy attached to it before launch, I honestly don't care; it's about the game, at the end of the day, and Exodus is certainly worth your time."

121,maxxer,"Dec 31, 2019",4,"At last have I finished dis game and want to share with ya all the details. It has plenty of dialogues about 10-15 minutes each, every npc just dreams to talk with Artyom but he keeps his silent vow and only grunts and shakes his head occasionally. Enemies, thank the lord, have become irreversibly stupid: all the time they are constantly missing their shots, readily give themselves up to be captured and, the most enjoyable, wait patiently to be murdered, which is kinda interesting. The game has become very easy, in fact so easy that my three yo son who hasn't finished his potty training yet, can beat it on hardcore, no sweat, which made me very happy by that and him too. Stealth became even retardier than LL: enemies in full light can't see Artyon even within 5 feet, for example. Now you can dance behind enemies' backs the most outrageous brakedances and they won't hear - every Metro fan has long dreamt about doin' that. Big beautiful locations with same sheds here and there, outside toilets - you can admire their beauty forever. Shame you can't enter any toilet - poor Artyom only looks at them with longing, cow mooish sight but can't do any poop, which is not good for his health and intestines. Now, in the game there are many ammo and health packs laying around as well as gasmask filters. Forget about lack of resources from first game, nah! Devs got rid of those relics of the past because nothing may disrupt sheer admiration a player will experience upon looking at those nice swamps game spawns here and there; lame and empty desert with three and a half buildings; woods filled to the brim with one, even two bandit outposts. There, you can even enjoy the mushrooms grow - I spent half an hour watching them grow while enemies patiently waited for me to finish my otherworldly admirations, so I could just walk past by them without shooting anything which is obviously nice. Also you can engage in my favourite bland go-fetch quests - they are ABSOLUTELY fascinating with their empty refined shallowness - and you won't be even getting any reward whatsoever upon completing those! How realistic! Simply amazing! How nicely the devs cared about players' sense of pride and accomplishment! Also, it is worth mentioning that the game is filled with game crashing bugs, and bugs a bit smaller than that in such a pleasant way any Stalker fan would feel at home IMMEDIATELY here, warm and welcome. So here I am, filled with joy, getting good ending almost without any kills. But why even kill somebody? Dis is not a game about killings, dis is the game made for you to enjoy its buggy scenerey, grumpy lightnings, empty buldings in complete darkness, running hares, flying corpse-eating crows and dusty sandstorms, while listening to endless and stupid dialogues, undoubtly written by some 12 year old son of one of devs while riding Aurora in circles - but, hold on! - that can be spotted by only the most experienced of gamers out there. And the fact that game end brings you back to your roots, towards bowels of the dark stinky Metro makes this a fitting finale, best and most memorable episode of the whole game. Brav-o-o-o!"

131,DanielCullen,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"This game is what both of the previous games had but better. I think that the concept of going outside of the metro while still having the ability to be scared in claustrophobic situations was very exciting while being very nostalgic to the original games. On top of this, I feel like the graphics and overall atmosphere are superb to the setting of this game. To be honest the graphics from the redux version from the previous games has nothing on this as it has been stripped apart and built from the ground up. Also, we are able to see that there is a new concept of an open world / linear system in play where you are able o play in 4 unique worlds that harbour their own life and unique characters. On top of this, there are many tight spaces and key locations etc. to explore which are woven fantastically to the world. By far one gf the best 2019 10 / 10"
132,dedlunk,"Feb 25, 2019",7,"Поиграл чуть больше, мнение изменилось, неплохая игра, симпатичная картинка. Но все ранво те то, что ожидал.Чего хотелось: настоящего шутера как фар край, с атмосферой метро. Но нет... этого нет. Куча модификаций оружия, но нельзя использовать все это так как патронов нет. Убивать противников светом, что?! В руках автомат, а вы пауков зажигалкой убиваете. Эпик фейл.Тут смотрел начальные ролики думал, ну все сейчас какой нить рпк или м-60 соберу, без глушителя, чтоб ВСЕ слышали Артем идёт. Забрасывая как рембо, гранатами, коктейлями молотова. Без всякого стелса, ну кто хочет может через стелс, со снайперки с далека, без глушителя, чтоб все слышали. Под красивую картинку метро.Но нет, этого не завезли.А завезли только:куча роликов, процентов так 25% игры.QTE на нас напали, мы жмем F, выигрываем бой, процентов так 35% от ВСЕЙ игры.20% шароебимся по всей карте в поисках 1-2 патронов.15% бьем с приклада, так как патронов нет, или убиваем зажигалкой и фонариком5% шутер. Но как шутер, со стелса либо оглушаем, либо стреляем в голову, патронов то нет. Больше смахивает на какое нить кинцо типо Until Dawn, но реализовано очень криво, и явно авторы не хотели делать кинцо. Но тут видно, что работали ""специалисты"", дипломов понакупали, а толку? В общем не нашли денег на нормального сценариста и режиссера. Не спасает ни отличная картинка, ни юмор. Минусов помимо того что я описал выше, тоже хватает. Тот же молчаливый Артем, мог хотя бы приветы раздавать или говорить ""ок, сча сделаю"". Но это все мелочи, по сравнению с тем что я отнес к основному недостатку игры. Так что люди ждавшие отличный шутер типо фар края или фолоута 4 (а тут напоминаю наняли спецов из ID software, которые на шутерах собаку съели, и сразу получилась отличная стрельба в фоллауте) в мире метро, могут смело проходить мимо, тут этого нет."

136,0wn3df1x,"Feb 15, 2019",9,"Изначально я думал, что игра выйдет плохой, огорчало качество роликов. Вызвал подозрение и переход из Steam в Epic Store. Ничего особенного от игры я не ждал. Сперва я отнял балл из-за технических накладок и нагрузки на железо. Не понравилось отсутствие возможности включать и выключать подсказки о находящихся рядом коллекционных предметах. Но концовка этот балл восстановила. Не знаю, одна она в игре или нет, но выглядит очень логично и завершенно, иной вариант и представить трудно. На полное прохождение ушло 30 часов. Стрельба не надоедала, клаустрофобии стало меньше. Часто во всякие подземелья  ходить не нужно. На первый план вышла открытая местность с мерзкой, но родной грязью и халабудами на востоке России. Помимо любования природой и архитектурой, можно очень душевно посидеть с друзьями протагониста или даже со случайными NPC. И даже уходить от них не хочется. В рекламных роликах русская озвучка пугала, но в игре наоборот она звучит неплохо и не режет слух. Очень советую играть с ней и с выключенными субтитрами, поскольку кроме них в игре практически отсутствует интерфейс, и без всего этого она становится очень иммерсивной. Решения имеют краткосрочные и долгосрочные последствия, но они не всегда очевидны. Можно освободить какого-то человека, поговорить, узнать, что он негодяй и убить. А через несколько часов в подробностях прочитать о своем поступке в дневнике.Или другой пример, когда можно убить всех врагов, либо пощадить сдавшихся, либо вырубить всех, либо проскользнуть мимо всех и затем можно услышать, как другие враги обсуждают эту ситуацию и в зависимости от действий протагониста могут восхищаться им, бояться или ненавидеть. Таких ситуаций много и это здорово. Касательно темы русофобии, которую раскручивали некоторые блогеры. Чего-то прямым текстом я не увидел. А если трактовать как русофобию использование определённых образов в духе ""недалекие люди на территории России верят в фигню или делают фигню"", то и Mad Max или Far Cry 5 можно назвать американофобскими. А вот что действительно достойно внимания, так это то, что в команде протагониста есть люди разных национальностей: русский, казах, американец и так далее - и все они отлично ладят. Вот это один из концептов игры, а не какая-то выдуманная русофобия. По итогу могу сказать, что это точно один из лучших сюжетных шутеров десятилетия. Игра однозначно достойна 90 из 100. P.S. В то же время не осуждаю оценки и в 70-80, особенно со стороны западных изданий. Вряд ли американец или европеец, да вообще жители вне стран СНГ смогут прочувствовать всю полноту ламповых поездок в поезде в отечественном интерьере и экстерьере с душевными беседами. Я накинул игре балл только за это вот ощущение советского / российского отечества."

138,agramonte,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"Amazing!... Simply not been able to put it down. Runs great on a 1070Ti/2600 on High @1440p. The world is Stunning. Being in a train is just a fantastic idea - and works great for the game set-up. You are traveling down the tracks just like before, but depending on story elements the journey has tied in challenges and optional activities you can do in a big open zone. And if you like being a scavenger in games like The Last Of US. you will have a blast. The world is full of empty housed, tunnels down planes - you name it - just ready to explore. Find something great? run out of something?... You Can take out your bag and craft. Or go to a safe house to do it (you can be attacked if crafting in the open) Also exploring or doing other activities opens up other options on the map. Save some hostages? well here is a key that opens a door with useful items. You just need to brave half the map to go find it. A bit far so you think it will turn dark before you can get there? well stop at the safe house and sleep till morning (more creatures at night, so I do day time where mostly humans are around. They both still there - just in different percentage) But again, it is story based. So if the story needs you to be in an old Russian base. That is where you will be. It is not, an ""open world"" for the sake of it. I love how well everything flows so far - it keeps things fresh and moving. They can sell this only out of a trunk of a car and I would still buy it. From the opening credit (just beautiful) you can tell the amount of time and love that has been put into this ""game"" (It is Metro, so more like a Movie you control) Do yourself a favor if you like Story driven games. And play this game. Not to the end so Giving it a 9 for now."

153,DaGh057_K1NG,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"Finally this game has came! The first time I'd seen it back in 2017 I couldn't believe it. I loved Metro 2033 and Last Light, an I also read the books, so when this was first announced I was super excited. Well, 1 year and a half later, here it is, one of the best, if not the best, semi open world shooter that I've played.Stunning graphics, good story, far more optimized than what I expected. Clearly a GOTY candidate"

156,bops2hardcore,"Feb 15, 2019",9,"Metro Exodus is the best Metro so far, there are moments that seem so real, you actually play more careful so you don't get discovered or shot, making you play smarter.. As Artyom, he doesn't speak much although it forces you to think what he is thinking. There is a moment, where everyone seems to be tired of your antics and people are starting to doubt you, and  it seems Artyom is starting to doubt himself and hope for life on the outside, no words, it makes you think and feel. Artyom is exonerated by respect and admiration from some of the other stalkers and eventually proven right, and in that moment, this game with the social engineering is on a whole other level, besides the outstanding environment and graphics on Extreme. Its a perfect continuation of Metro Last Night, where they improve on the formula and do not make the mistakes of losing what made the series popular. You can see the time and care the 4A put into the game; its a masterpiece.  Giving a 9.5 because Epic Launcher, its not Steam but does the job. Amazing game."

When it doesn't crash you can't get into the game as it keeps snatching control from you to show cut scenes. Fantastic hype, rubbish PC game."
160,SemenSemenich,"Feb 15, 2019",8,"Люди, которые ставят этой игре 10 глупы не меньше тех, кто ставит ей 0. Игра не достойна таких высоких и низких оценок. К моему большому сожалению игра крепкий середняк. Хотелось большего, но по каким-то причинам не получилось. Хотя видно, что разработчики старались. Очевидно, что не даром прошли те переносы игры. Можно сколько угодно винить  издателей в переходе из Steam в Epic, но на эту игру нужно смотреть, как на продукт в вакууме. Начну с минусов: У игры большие проблемы с багами и оптимизацией. Складывается такое ощущение, что время, на которое перенесли игру, потратили на доработку сюжета, который здесь слабоват, а не на полишинг игры. Также мне не понравился пустой открытый мир. Создатели игры пытались не повторяться в 3-ий раз и решили разбавить Метро открытым миром. Но к большому разочарованию у них это не получилось. Исследовать эти просторы скучно. Стоит отметить, наличие русофобии, которая нет-нет, да и проступает в сюжете (ИМХО. На оценку это не влияет, так как игра ориентирована больше на Запад). Закрадывается ощущения того, что игре не хватает РПГ составляющей. Очень не хватает полноценных диалогов и возможность не убивать всех подряд. Из плюсов хочется отметить хорошую музыку. Наличие мелочей, которые заставляют остановиться и послушать о чём рассуждают между собой персонажи.  Эти детали заставляют погрузиться в атмосферу игры по самые уши, что очень важно для подобных игр. Визуальная составляющая игры находится на высоте. Игра приятна не только с точки зрения графики, но и дизайн в ней сделан отлично, хотя иногда он и заводит в тупик. Стрельба от серии к серии становится только лучше. Для тех, кто играет в первый раз - это убого, а для фанатов очевидно, что данная механика была значительна улучшена. В итоге мы имеем хороший, но средний шутер. Не понимаю зачем нужно было лезть в ААА, так как там эта игра не может похвастаться всем тем, чем хороши ААА-проекты (Но Fallout 76 и BattleField 5 тоже ААА, хотя казалось бы при чём тут Укра... 4AGames). Игру стоило продавать по 20$ и не претендовать  на бессмысленные лавры. Игра бы сама получила статус культовой в своём классе. Очень жаль, что получилось именно так, но в целом игрой я доволен и ставлю ей 8 Артёмов из 10 Мельников (8/10). Спасибо"
161,gamerrab,"Feb 17, 2019",9,"EDIT:score changed to 9. Great game now that I've found out my reason for crashes. Radeon driver 10.2.2 appeared to be the culprit.  Running without crashed with 10.1.1First, I don't care about the delivery platform. I just want to play the game.  Purchase, installation all ok.  Major problem is that its buggy.  Quite a few crashes to desktop or blue screen.  Makes progress very difficult.  Openning levels pretty dull until we get out of Moscow.  This game also suffers from consolitus - nothing new these days, but you all know what I mean.  One example being lack of FOV adjustment.  Shooting seems slightly off too - think its the gun crosshairs not in line witth the gun barrels.  Giving the benefit of the doubt at this time.  Reliability needs improving within a couple of days."
162,aldrarin,"Feb 15, 2019",9,"Игра довольно хороша, как в графическом, так и в сюжетном плане, геймплей тоже на уровне. Псевдо открытый мир интересно исследовать, его проработка радует. Правда анимация лиц персонажей реально кал, уровень 2008 года. Также удручает исскуственный интеллект, он реально тупой. В остальном игра шикарна, безумно атмосферна. Всем рекомендую и не смотрите на отзывы с 0 оценкой их пишут стимодрочеры, для которых не важна игра, а важен лишь значек, который они получат после ее прохождения. Всем же нормальным людям советую."
163,DreamCore,"Feb 15, 2019",9,"Having played both previous games I had high hopes for this game. I've only played 3 hours this far but wow, it does not fail to deliver. The graphics are superb on 4k Ultra with RTX and DLSS and the performance is very good with steady 60fps on my 2080 Ti. Anyone saying the graphics are bad are either blind or just here for trolling. The previous games were known for their great lighting and atmosphere and Exodus raises the bar even further. The game is not open world but semi-open-world with linear segments between. I was worried it was going to be yet another bland open-world game but it's actually not. The story is great so far. To all people down-voting the game because it's on Epic Store only. Seriously, you're pathetic. Sure, I hate that they just suddenly removed it from steam, but everyone who already pre-ordered on Steam will still get it. Also it's a good thing that Valve gets competition. They charge developers an insane amount for putting up your games there, more than twice what Epic charges. It's time for Valve to lose their monopoly. It amazes me how people can cry so much because they have to install Epic Launcher. It's still the same damn game. Kids need to grow up..."

Ofc., as always, you should be sure, your rig has the latest version of your VGA driver, new GeForce driver just released 2 days ago.

176,CHERI1230,"Feb 17, 2020",2,"Игра после прохождения оставила весьма негативные эмоции, если честно то я ожидал большего. Metro Exodus это совсем не то метро к которому мы привыкли.Плюсы:Транспорт. Было интересно плавать на лодке и гонять по пустыне на буханке.Псевдо открытый мир. Дает возможность побродить и отвлечься от сюжетной линии.Модификация оружия интересней прошлых частей.АтмосферностьНесколько локаций с меняющейся климатом и атмосферой в целом.На этом к сожалению все.А теперь к минусамМинусы:Немой Артем и длинные монологи. Порой скучно ждать пока пройдет весь монолог. Ты стоишь и тупо слушаешь тонну текста в котором ты не принимаешь участвия от слова совсем.Крайне тупой и заскриптованный AI. Проходил игру дважды и встречал врагов в одних и тех же местах. Конечно с расположением бандитов все понятно, но вот монстры могли бы и перемещаться. Тем более в игре есть режим сложности хардкор рейнджер который подразумевает под собой повторное прохождение,чего уж там прямым текстом написано.Графика. Выкрутил графон на максимум, а получил все те же мыльные текстурки и просадки ФПСа. Я не дрочер ФПСа, но не меняющаяся визуальная часть не должна жрать столько ресурсов. Из этого пункта вытекает следующий.Оптимизация, стационарник за 3к $ имеет просадки фпс и загружен по самое не балуй хотя графика года эдак 2014.Пустой псевдо открытый мир. Мир мы открыли, а вот контентом не наполнили.Постоянное надрачивание стелса при прохождении, стелси это стелси то иначе получешь плохую концовку.Фактически обязательно лазать по локации и собирать мини квесты которые влияют на концовку, если в прошлых частях ты линейно проходил уровень и мог выполнить по пути мини квест который влияет на концовку то тут ты его уже можешь пропустить.Стелс, стелс и еще раз стелс, как же у меня горело от него на хардкоре при повторном прохождении. Бандиты которые берут в рабство людей, но их убивать нельзя потому что стелс. Фанатики которые тебя готовы пришить за фонарик в руках, их тоже нельзя убивать они не виноваты... Ну хоть на Ямантау можно было убивать людоедов хотя странно по логике разработчиков они тоже хорошие просто жизнь заставила.В некоторых монологах ловишь фейспалмы, а во время диалога Мельника с Ямантау так я вообще проломил себе лицо от фейспалмом.Цена. Цена как за полноценную ААА игру, но сама игра похоже на работу инди студии. Игра того не стоит.Последняя локация она же и миссия вообще отдельная тема. Закос под прошлые части метро хотя авторы так старательно пытались от них уйти. Тупо беготня с кучей поноса слов и местами встречающимися библиотекарями.Дальше мне лень расписывать каждый пункт так что перечислю минусы в одном предложении. Анимация, физика, урон, стрельба, баги."
177,WokeShibe,"Feb 22, 2020",1,This game has a good story it seems and mechanics but the optimization for this game is so pisspoor its laughable. i cant even get a consistent 60 fps on a high end PC. Crashes are a big issue as well with it crashing in the caspian area every 5 minutes. its been a whole year and they havent fixed anything for shame!
178,Hobbs,"Jun 14, 2020",3,Too many cut scenes.  Game play feels slow and uninteresting.  Controls are are poor. Looks nice.
179,magicmoo,"Jul 27, 2020",5,"What a letdown this was for me... I liked the previous games, but this one ended up being more of a chore after a while and the main reason I pulled through was because I was enjoying the RTX visuals. The second open world area absolutely killed this game. It's simply horrendous. Speaking of the open world and the new crafting system, it's so obvious that it's just designed to be a time sink and not to be actually fun. Exploration in particular is not rewarding at all. All in all, this whole new approach just makes the game more streamlined and not better in any way from my point of view. What made the franchise unique is gone. It's too bad, because, when Metro Exodus actually tries to be Metro instead of any other boring open world game, it's actually quite alright and definitely had its moments, although the story was rather uninspired as well."
180,epeternally,"Nov 10, 2019",2,"Most bad games fail due to a lack of resources - mechanics aren't polished, performance is bad, or there's a lot of game breaking issues. Metro Exodus suffers from none of that. Everything about it is competently put together but in terms of game design I would sincerely argue that Metro Exodus is the worst major AAA game ever released. There is no excuse for a save system that overwrites manual saves with automatic ones, for weapons that feel spongy and punchless in comparison to The Outer Worlds, for mechanics that are consistently and deliberately unfun in as many ways as could be conceived. Dark Souls is a well designed game that happens to be difficult. Metro eschews actual game design in favor of an obsession with masochism that makes System Shock 2 look player friendly. The only redeeming point here is dark nights with raytracing, as a video game you'd be hard pressed to come up with a more spectacular failure than Metro Exodus. Play Prey 2017 or The Evil Within 2 instead."
181,Namloc,"Sep 29, 2019",7,"+ Awesome graphics+ Weapons feel nice+ Story is decent - Open world is on rails (its barley open world)- No RPG elements- Decisions are limited, rare and feel non consequential- Fairly short campaign, slightly erupt ending This game with steam mods will be a much better experience but $2 on WIndows Game Pass was a great deal."

185,pongkrit03,"Feb 11, 2020",9,"This is the first Metro for me. My overall experiences are outstanding. Graphic is ultra beautiful. Story is very strong. Voice casting is top-notched. Gameplay are good. However, it is not perfect yet. For what I don't like about this game, First, the game focuses too much on peaceful approach. I am ok with the optional ways to play, but getting bad ending because you kill too much is not a freedom of choice but rather forcing players to play what devs want. It is bad design.  Second, there is no highlight for the object you could pick up or interact with, so you have to look carefully at everything surrounding you (even with Metal detector, it is still waste of time). Third, gun modding and upgrades are needed to be find in journey only. You can't just buy it from merchant, and if you don't use guide online, you probably miss some or many, depending on how you thoroughly search. For exp, It will be your bad luck if you get a lot but miss one on your main gun. Still, I am very satisfied with everything else. Gameplay, Graphic, Story, especially at the ending so I think 9/10 is a very decent score for Metro Exodus. Every NPC is memorable. Devs did a very great job here."
186,Idiota150,"Jun  4, 2019",5,"Something about the game gives my a constant mild headache. No performance issues and graphics look really nice - ray tracing doesn't add anything BTW. Dialogs and voices are super tedious and all I can think is 'Stop talking'. Hate that enemies respawn if you walk away from an area, e.g. just to make more bullets. At least with a controller, it's very easy to waste a lot of bullets to kill just a simple enemy, cool weapons though. Gives the impression of open-world but is far from it. Sound positioning does not work very well, not very binaural if you know what I mean. I'm gonna stop playing now after some 15 hours due to the headaches and game not being very inspiring."

189,Burretploof,"Feb 29, 2020",3,"They took out what made the previous games interesting - the claustrophobic metro tunnels - and replaced them with a generic semi-open world (because even 4A needs to follow trends now, apparently). Combat and stealth both feel worse than in the previous games ('clunky' is the word, I guess). Locations aside from the few tunnel/city locations are pretty generic. The open-world elements serve no purpose, there's essentially nothing to do or explore...so why have a semi open-world in the first place? Also, the game is buggy as hell and very prone to crashing. I've lost count of how often I had to restart the game because it randomly froze or crashed to desktop.Plus, the story was weak, too. Predictable and unnecessarily contrived. Not on par with the previous games. The game is super pretty, though... but that can't save this mess of a game. A waste of time and money, unfortunately. 4A needs to go back to the drawing board and should re-evaluate what made the first two Metro games so good. They made good games before and I'm sure that they can do it again."
190,Deaden84,"Nov 25, 2019",9,"Good story telling, nice and enough RPG elements. This game is improving itself with each game and openworld was a good designed version for future of Metro games. Also it is deserving to be GOTY for 2019. Especially there is very nice integration between characters, friendship etc. It's a journey story in a post-apocalyptic world and it's deserving to play if you like these kind of games. Also I see some negative reviews about this game. I guess these players are impatient players due to some bugs and crushes at the launch. Which game doesn't have?!? Wait for updated versions and voila!So, just avoid these false negative reviews for seeing the true potential in this game by yourself."
191,Hurrikhan,"Jun 14, 2021",4,"TL/DR first : This game is awful, I couldn't force myself to ""play"" it more than a few hours. I have good memories of the first Metro games. I remember they were dark and interesting.I also remember I didn't want to punch friendlies in the face while screaming ""shut up"" again and again.  It's the little things like that that makes a game bearable. Exodus is different in that regard. I've spent the first two hours of the game listening to people talking pointlessly, mostly doing exposition and telling the obvious. Contrary to the previous game, the writing feels superficial and lazy. While enduring these awful listening moment, I felt it was written for a very young audience. Of course you cannot move during these  so you have to wait the end of some inane drivel that goes on an on.The way the game held my hand, sometimes literally, tends to confirm that impression. Hand-holding is something I despise so this didn't improve my impression one bit. In an nutshell : I've hated it.  It got better after the first two hours when I was able to finally a bit alone exploring or hearing normal people speaking.  At least now I understand why our character prefer to spend most of his time alone in deadly toxic areas filled with monsters.  He can have peace away from the wife. (I've actually said ""Thank you"" to an enemy who silenced her with a punch.) When you can actually play, the game is pretty but I don't feel the RTX is very important here. I had to play with headphones though : the fans of my RTX2080 are kind of noisy.  About performance I was mostly around 90fps during my play time. (TR 2950x, 64GB RAM) I was hoping that with any luck I my group would get killed. But four hours of that regime is all I could abide. I've installed that unpleasant piece of trash along with all the DLCs I own.  I regret having wasted money, bandwidth an electricity for that."

The spawn of the same monsters in the open world, the poor places to explore, and other details made me wish sometimes that the open world moments were over. Anyway, story, sound, graphics, weapons upgrades, npc, the different environments, and so so many other details, make Metro Exodus a must play video game."

198,T-Babyboi,"Nov  2, 2019",5,"I expected non linear Fallout 4 style gameplay for such a large file sized game, what I got was a game that thinks graphics and some pseudo sandbox maps will make a great game, non linear sandbox is like a cork board with random pins placed all over it, that lead to a choice of several endings, what this game is....just another sad RTX attempt like Battlefield v, the game looks good, at times even pulls you in a little with the nice reflections, but something about the game feels very heavy, a slow crawl with a barrage of objectives or button pressing to crawl under things right from the start, which bring the whole mood to a very heavy and thick experience.Sandbox non linear to me means a free choice of how and when you attempt a quest within the story, this game basically just constantly tells you what has to be done with no real choice or direction to travel otherwise, it feels like working a second job playing this game.Imagine the perfect cup of coffee, with just the right amount of cream, sugar if that's your thing, even a little bit of head from it being fresh pressed......now take that same good coffee and pour it into a cup with a gratuitous amount of creamer,  im talking half a container of heavy cream, the coffee is now thick, tasting more of a tart cream than of actual coffee, sliding down the back of your throat like a cap full of Pepto-Bismol...….that to me is the Metro Exodus experience.Once I finish the game in full, I may change the review if the actual story can redeem the false advertising, but all I can say now is if the game keeps up the same theme, I might even uninstall before the end."

204,Lizarino,"Aug 12, 2021",5,"This is the first Metro game I've seen or played- Really boring story with frequent long dialogue scenes where control is taken away from you, felt more like a bad movie than a game.- Games graphics are good at times but really ugly other times. Doesn't help there are filters and effects almost always covering your screen making it hard to see anything / the game look ugly.- Empty and uninteresting open world.- Inconsistent stealth. Sometimes I get spotted when I feel I shouldn't, other times I don't get seen when I was sure I would."

209,Konrad_,"Nov 21, 2019",9,"This game really is a piece of art, and propably my favourite part in the series so far. There is lots of fanservice for readers of the books, and the DLC ""The Two Colonels"" is even better, a few glitches and an unengaging start aside. Propably my game of the year, and a must-play for fans of the books. My only critique, however, would be the questionable ammount of optimization, it really doesn't run all that well on low-end PCs. But the immaculate and magnificent story keeps you glued to the screen, no matter the resolution you're forced to play on."

211,Kif1983,"Dec 15, 2019",8,"In a lot of ways it's a fairly typical Metro game.  If you already like the setting, general story, and can put up with some of the quirks.  It's great. The previous importance on context is there, the HUD is very minimal because there's a tangible excuse for the way you interact with the world and see information.  You want to know how long is left on your gas mask filter? Look at your wrist.  On top of that, more so than other shooters, you have to think about what's going on.  Keeping on top of how broken your gas mask is, how much filter you have left, whether you need to pump charge your flashlight.  This adds extra challenges to both combat, and stealth sections. It's also more than a typical Metro game.  The game takes a step towards open world RPG. The locales and atmosphere are far more expansive than previous games. There's some Breath of the Wild inspiration; rather than a bunch of questions marks just appearing on your map, you have to discover locations.  You also have to consider whether you wish to tackle a mission during the day or at night, with pros and cons for either approach. There are some small negative things. A lot of dialogue clips over each other.  And it's taken such a step towards an RPG, that at points it feels odd when you don't have agency to do something.  For instance, there's one point where there's a very apparent trap, but you have no means to do anything about it until it is sprung.  However, these are small problems that haven't stopped me enjoying a great game."

220,Heroic,"Mar 30, 2019",0,"A terrible console port with broken custom controls, annoying interaction circles, and that is a let-down of a sequel with ultimately very few enemies to fight and most of the content of the game lacking any of the action-packed and dangerous environments of the previous games, and much of the game feeling even more linear and repetitive than the previous actual corridor shooters that were 2033 and LL.Exodus takes about the same amount of time to playthrough as 2033 and LL, but most of that in Exodus is bloated content you're forced through of conversations and handholding, yet there is a tiny fraction of action and combat to be had in Exodus. A Exodus playthrough will take hours (about 4 hours just carving through it), and in that time the number of significant fights you had can be counted on two hands and most of them will be a 1-2 minutes of combat.Also Exodus is a terrible PC port with broken and unplayable aspects.As of writing this the game has been out for over a month and none of these game-breaking issues and console aspects from a bad port have been fixed. BROKEN FOV: There is no FOV option, and the default is very small and nauseating. In the previous games in the series this was okay as you could go into game files and edit them for a larger FOV. However in Exodus there are many screen effects that do not adjust with the new custom FOV. Everytime you are wounded in a fight you will have a red box in the middle, and also across the middle of the screen have a large ugly giant red blob line across the screen (which normally is supposed to be at the top of the screen). BROKEN CUSTOM CONTROLS: Firstly if you use custom controls, especially if you're a numpad user, then you're in big trouble as the controls for interacting with workbenches and radios and the like won't change to your custom keys. Instead the defaults will be written for controls; F, D, A etc, and pressing those defaults won't work.This means that everytime time you need to use a workbench of radio you need to go back into your key mappings, remap to the default, interact with the radio and workbench, and then go back into options and remap to your custom keys and carry on playing the game. With having to regularly use workbenches to clean your weapons this is not fun.INTERACTION CIRCLES: Firstly the game is plagued with ugly console interaction circles. But these are particularly bad in how they've been applied to looting bodies. In the Metro series you're constantly picking up ammo (or in Exodus parts to craft ammo) - as you progress through a firefight you'll quickly loot from the body of a killed opponnent. In the previous games in the sequel you tapped you use key twice to loot the body and their weapon.For some reason the devs decided that it would be a good idea to make it so that you must aim at the enemy weapon and hold reload to remove the ammo and modifications from the enemy weapon, and also use the interact key to loot the body and reload key to loot from the weapon. This now means that instead of sliding through a seamless firefight naturally looting bodies, instead you now must use the interact key to loot the body (careful not to accidentally look to the side at the weapon where you're then pressing the wrong key), stop in the middle of the fight, look at the weapon on the floor, hold reload and wait for an interaction circle to loot the ammo.Enjoy doing this thousands of times. Content:I've played Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light countless times. Around 100 times each. They are 'linear' games, but much of the gameplay in each level can be played many times over as the fights are always exciting and challenging.In Metro Exodus - the open world game (though most of the game isn't in open world environments) - the entirety of the game can be broken down to a handful of minor easy gunfights and battles with mutants.Firstly there are only 3 'open world' areas, and one of them is very incredibly linear where you're stripped of your equipment and forced down a boring path that isn't fun the first time, let alone replaying it. The other two open world areas are cool, but they're relatively small and can run across them in a few minutes, and I can count on one hand the number of areas of these maps where there are groups of a few enemies you wipe out in a matter of seconds.The rest of the game is linear levels which are frankly complete trash and unworthy of the series.Again, I have played 2033 and countless times and I love going through those levels again and again everytime... Meanwhile you couldn't pay me to replay the corridor sections that make up half of Exodus.The beginning chapter of the game is scripted and very linear and repetitive. It's just crap.Another one is a ridiculous level spamming gunfire at harmless mindless cannibal enemies I've run out of characters but bad content, bugs, bad port, terrible replayability, hollow, hardly any combat"
221,miamibreak,"Apr 15, 2019",6,"Good game but nothing special - definately not as good as previous Metros. Horrible enemies (blind gorillas - wtf??? and that fking fat bear again...god! so lame), many bugs, shallow and unsatisfying endings. It's worth to play through especially if you are a fan of Metro lore but you will ask the question time to time ""why am I playing this, why am I here, why these irritating enemies"" etc. See it for yourself."
222,vkrivykh,"Feb 27, 2019",10,"Доброго времени суток каждому, кто читает этот отзыв. Начну с того, что люди поставившие игре оценку ""0"", просто в нее не играли или не хотят играть.Адекватный человек этой игре поставить такую оценку просто не может, либо он просто не Человек. Предшествующие игре события с её размещением в том или ином магазине, некоим образом не должныотвлекать от сути содержания последней. Такие оценки мне однозначно не понятны.Да и какая разница, что перед релизом купить игру в Steam стало невозможно.Вообще, как можно оценивать игру исходя из продающей её платформы, причем стоимость в Steam (когда был предзаказ)и сейчас в Epic Store абсолютно одинакова! Теперь, хочу сказать об игре. Хочу отметить именно духовную составляющую данной игры. Эта игра - о человеческой неугомонности (стремлении к превосходству) и как итог - глупости.О любви. Об отцах и детях. О человечности и о способности принять решение, которое не принесет вреда тому, кто даже его заслуживает.О новой сложившейся религии и о природе, в её, почти первозданном виде.О Друзьях, которые бесконечно много готовы сделать для Родных людей.Да, именно слово ""Родной"" в этой игре, как никакое, может передать тонкое, любящее отношение к своим близким и дорогим людям.Да и сама собравшаяся интернациональная команда (Дамир, Сэм...), дает пищу для размышлений: ""а зачем вообще некоторые люди, да что там - народы,порой испытывают такую неприязнь друг к другу?"". Кто-то говорит, что игра ""несколько контрастна"" исходя из предыдущих частей ""Metro 2033"" и ""Metro Last Light"", я же не вижу ничего такого,что могло-бы нарушить линию, которая повествует о характере и стремлении Артема к лучшей жизни в нынешнем постапокалиптическом мире.Да, порой игрок ощущает себя попав в мир ""Безумного Макса"" или ""Rage"" или вернувшись в увлекательное путешествие по вселенной ""Итана Картера"".Но, если представить. Не таков ли будет мир на самом деле - вариативный и властный.Ведь бескрайние просторы России сложно полностью уничтожить, а значит, жизнь хоть где-то да будет теплиться, в том виде которая есть. Отдельной похвалы заслуживает музыка, а точнее её композитор.Эта музыка берет за душу в различных ее интерпретациях на протяжении всей игры: местами лейтмотив, мелодия в оркестровом исполнении или жеэто просто дуэт в исполнении Артема и Степана на гитаре, в выдавшиеся свободные минуты путешествия. Как итог, хочу сказать, что игра заслуживает самой высокой оценки, не смотря на некоторые недостатки в оптимизации.Я был погружен в чувственную атмосферу и увлекательную жизненную и неподдельную историю людей,которые ищут место для своего комфортного существования, любви и дальнейшего развития человеческого рода."

225,HotHelios,"May 22, 2019",4,"Gameplay is uninspired, gets boring pretty quickly. Optimization is lacking, you'll get frame drops regularly on the big open spaces. The biggest flaw of this game is by far its story. The game contains basically  a single female character, your wife, and the story revolves around you saving her from different situations, even tho she was supposed to be a badass sniper. The game also lacks the uniqueness of its predecessors, with the loss of the dark corridors of the Metro the game basically became a cliche, badly written, generic post-apocalyptic shooter."
226,pjaguilar,"Feb 25, 2019",2,"Well, i've tried this game a couple of hours, and after absolutely falling in LOVE with Metro Last Light, i have to say that i'm deeply dissapointed. They stripped the game from what it made the series, dark, narrow spaces. Precisely what was boring in Last Light were the open spaces. Now is just another FPS with an semi-open world, with no sense of mission or direction. But hey!!! Your gun actually jams when you need it most, and you have to clean it in a bench, so if you have a dirty gun, no luck there, you are dead. (because in real life you dont have the possibility of cleaning up your gun with a basic kit, no way Jose)"
227,canadian1969,"May 27, 2019",4,"Pros:-Some interesting story elements, creatures and NPC's.-Nice weapons crafting system with unique firearms.-Excellent graphics and general atmosphere, lots of eye candy.-I liked the map and compass system, lends itself to a more realistic scenario than minimaps etc. Cons:-Way too much dialog and inescapable cut-scenes, seriously about 50% of the game is actual game-play, the other 50 reading and listening to endless dialog, I got to the point where i would just get up and go do something else while the endless dialogs played out. Thats an epic fail imo-Game cant decide if its on rails or open world.-Seriously poorly conceived boss fights-The few big climactic scenes were lackluster, yawn.-Keybinding system is broken-Enemy difficulty determined exclusively by hit-points, no strategy or interesting AI components. Just bang away on it until its dead.-row boats were a nightmare (so I guess some realism there even if unintended)-buggy, crashed about 5-6 times during play with no particular reason why, just dumps to the desktop occasionally, my body vanished about half way through game, so played the last half without being able to see my  characters hands.-melee combat was so poorly designed I dont have words to describe it. Melee felt like a game from 20 years ago.-save system is a bit douche baggy I did not have any expectations from this game as I have not played previous iterations. I have however played every other post-apocalyptic game out there and this falls far short of even old games like Fallout 3 or Stalker . Overall for the money this is a pass. For $10-15 and 20 hours to kill, go for it. $80 is a rip off imo. plus another $30 for DLC, maybe its worth $30 total with updates and DLC. Overall I felt frustrated playing this game, it constantly wrestled you out of game-play breaking immersion which is a cardinal sin. Worse many of these unavoidable cut-scenes and story elements were action based and there is no reason why the player should have to put down the controls and watch the game do things for you. Now I have to go replay the stalker series just to get the bad taste of this game out of my mouth. I may need to play the original Metro just for comparison, but all in I all thought this game sucked. Kinda like a high-school mean-girl, she aint pretty, she just looks that way,"
228,Nik0lay,"Feb 22, 2019",0,"A lot of technical issues!!!Intentionally low graphics on standard (not RTX) video cards (apparently ao agreement with Nvidia). But the saddest thing is that the authors did not spare their efforts and made a lot of details aimed at inciting hatred between the Russian and Ukrainian people. This is very bad considering that the game is sold both in Russia and in Ukraine.I absolutely do not understand why this is necessary, because the world is already bursting at the seams, why they incite more hatred. And everyone treats this indifferently, but if African Americans, or women, were insulted in this game, human rights activists would immediately sue the developers. But since insulted the Russian people, then no one will do anything. It's a shame, because because of all these political wars, ordinary people are forced to see all this nonsense.I myself am a Ukrainian, but I have no hatred for the Russian people!"

The game is heavily nerfed for AMD cards, but not only that, the lighting is also nerfed for non-RTX cards so that RTX cards look better than non-RTX.

238,caveman1980,"Feb 24, 2019",1,"Yet another unpolished, hastily ported, un-optimized PC game. For being a brand-new installment of the Metro series, the overall gaming mechanics feel very dated. There's quite a number of technical glitches at this point in time, especially with regards to the AI, whose behavior is just dreadful (jerky movement, spawning into one another, non-predictable detection - even while hiding in dimly lit places, walking through objects, doors and walls, etc.). The story itself is fairly average: your companion Anna lends a 'helping hand' in combat situations, all other NPCs are forgettable in the long run. The pseudo open-world is beautiful, but unappealing - I personally preferred the underground tunnels in both previous Metro games. It's almost like the developers knew the game wasn't going to be that well-received and decided to mindlessly accept the Epic Store 'exclusive listing' proposal to cash in a certain amount of money. Thank God I chose the option to have a taste of this game without paying. Harr!"

Was mir allerdings nicht egal ist, ist die Tatsache, dass man ein Spiel nicht starten kann wegen einem Intro. Tatsächlich löste das Löschen des Intros die Problematik.

Вообще не вижу смысла так гнобить игру только из-за эпиков.Однако,  прям высокой оценки тоже поставить не могу, так как изобилие фризов , крашей и вылетов просто бесит до жути!! При всем при том, что на стиме таких проблем нет, почему ?В плане графона, тут все неоднозначно, местами наблюдаешь такие картины что и не удивляешся жутким просадкам фпс, но порой просадки  до 20 кадров встречаются на таких мыльных картинах что мысли о кривой оптимизации просто не покидают голову.Атмосферность и сюжет - тут в принципе все отлично, играть очень интересно и пейзажи крайне захватывающие, то что разработчики вложили душу в дизайн видно даже невооруженным глазом (жаль западным игрокам не понять).Однако, я очень сильно надеюсь что разработчики еще поработают над этой игрой (техническое исполнение ну очень кривое), не совсем понятно зачем было переносить релиз на более ранний срок если продукт откровенно говоря - сырой.Да и странно как то , было бы что то революционное в плане графики тогда можно было бы понять такие требования к системе, но при такой картинке... З.Ы. 1070ти , экстрим пресет, разброс по кадрам 15-60"

There is nothing to do on these ""sandbox"" maps... I want more but there's nothing..So sad... People would like to spend days in the Metro exploring and doing stuff... Not an afternoon..To top it off, half the game you have to keep people alive or it ruins the ending. So it's a survival sandbox shooter where you can't shoot or kill most of the time.just sneak around..FUN! Thank God I didn't buy this trash, completed it on a friends console in an afternoon."
245,Struck3r,"Feb 27, 2019",3,"Where to begin... Graphics. Altho this game's graphics have been inflated by ""reviewers"" all over the net, because of its RTX feature, I find graphics to be not easy on the eye, to feel outdated. I do not own an RTX graphics card, but at 1440p ultra, this game outta be more realistic. Animation is poor, there were many outright bugs with terrain, some really blurry textures in open world as well as inside buildings, notably walls, bricks, stones etc. I cant figure how digital foundry and few others reviews about graphics could possibly be so damn encouraging. Plot... The games story feels like some 3rd grade writer idea of a good story. If the writer had put more work onto it, it coulda feel good. Story and the characters that feel it are so plastic, so uninteresting, that it makes me sick to my stomach. Not once throughout the play did I have a feeling for any of the chars, fear for their safety or emotion for them possibly getting killed was lacking. This is ofc because you cant relate to characters that has no character at all. Even the main ones, most important to the story, they all feel like dolls, with a tape recorder inside their body, that has bad script playing. And the fact that the main character hasnt said a word throughout the gameplay part of the experience is telling. It just feels so wrong. Many times Artyom was asked of opinion, or just player would feel like there is something he should say, but he is totally silent. Retarded decision by devs if you ask me. The sound in game isnt anything special. Gunshots hurts my ears. The voice of characters telling uninteresting stories, the bad acting of bad russian accent its all... so... disappointing. Worst part, for me, was the gameplay. AI is so screwed. Its 2019. And yet, you go on a silent killing spree, you can run to your target, it wont hear you. You can ""silent"" kill a target that speaks to another NPC in the middle of conversation, while they sit few meters from each other, under a light, and while doing so you will hear the noise from hand killing the NPC, the NPC's last breaths, but the companion NPC will not give a **** AI of zombies and mutants is story of its own. The rocktrowing NPC... Someone mind explaining why would he trow a rock, or a brick, at certain distance, forever??? And it gets worse... He will do so in a manner that you can avoid each and every trow. When they are on a path, you can walk behind them, get so close, shoot around them, and they will not stop to wonder: ""hey, what is this **** im gonna turn around and eat it!"". Its one of worst ""tripple A"" game AI's ive seen in my life. Not to make a novel out of this... I give this game a 3/10. Those 3 points goes to the franchise, I used to love, so for respect for former work I can give 3. But if this was brand new game, without RTX support, I can guarantee you it would get the same score from all major reviewers. Well, im off to bed, hope I wont dream the scarily stupid AI from the game."

А именно: во время миссии ""Старый маяк"" нам нужно помочь Гюль убить бандитов, убиваем, но Гюль не торопится спускать нам лодку, перепроходим миссию 5 раз, убиваем сдавшегося - мало. Перезагрузили пк и проверяем игру на целостность и перепроходим еще раз, стреляем в Гюль, кидаем в нее ножи, расстреливаем ее лодку - спасибо.

Стрельба посредственна, апгрейд оружия убог. Монстров убивать неинтересно потому что ничего за них не дают и они слишком быстро респавнятся. Мир абсолютно не вызывает желания его исследовать. Многие пишут про офигенную атмосферу, дескать, дома, иконы, пустые пузыри - наше, родное. У меня к этому вообще ноль эмоций, не ностальгии, не отвращения. Особой русофобии я также не заметил. Из плюсов можно выделить неплохую графику (особенно вода) и, пожалуй, всё. Главный минус для меня - играть неинтересно. Конвейерные ассасины затянули сильнее и тот же третьесортный ELEX показался увлекательнее. А уж сравнение Exodus и Сталкера для меня вообще за гранью понимания. В остатке только мысль: и этого я ждал с таким нетерпением?"

251,Qxzy,"Mar  3, 2019",10,"Неделю назад я прошел игру Metro Exodus и для меня лично эта игра является произведением искусства. Да конечно же спорить не стану, не в плане технического исполнения. Но хочу заметить, что бюджет студии разработчиков игры был явно поменьше чем у многих студий разрабатывающих игры AAA уровня и при этом, игра исполнена на удобоваримом уровне качества. И особенно ""нашим"" игрокам надо понимать, что не нужно душить и без того практически бездыханное тело ""нашего"" игростроя, но почему то этого нет. Но я о другом.Главное о чем мне хотелось рассказать, это почему я считаю эту часть Metro игрой - произведением искусства и почему она для меня 10/10. А считаю я так, потому что заложенное разработчиками тяжелое сценарное наполнения, и эмоциональный спектр в нем, который игра принесла мне в конце прохождения, перекрыли все её недостатки и лично для меня это очень весомый аргумент. Ведь по моему мнению, не все игры должны постоянно развлекать игроков и убивать их время, а и должны быть игры которые увлекают рассказом и заставляют над чем то задумываться людей играющих в них, с чем метро по моему мнению справилось хорошо. Но таких игр к сожалению в наше время выходит мало, что бы поливать их и их разработчиков грязью. Думаю нужно задуматься и что то изменить в отношении, что бы и в дальнейшем хоть изредка выходили игры, в которых бы были заложены какое то послание авторов к игрокам, какие то посылы которые заставляют задуматься над теми или иными вещами, и оставить после себя какие то эмоции, помимо веселья, так как это делает кино. Концовка Metro Exodus для меня была словно сильный в эмоциональном плане кинофильм. Но еще на этапе прохождения игры читая всю информацию в дневнике и найденных записках, слушая все радио переговоры и диалоги нписи, я углубился в этот мир настолько, что мне этого было достаточно для того, что бы весь экипаж Авроры стал для меня, моими друзьями, моей девушкой и моим... Мельником. Не просто прописанными нписи, а живыми людьми проще говоря. Игру я прошел на хорошую концовку, но плохая концовка не менее задела меня, а то и более. Если не углубятся, то она заставляет задуматься над очень интересным вопросом, который как по мне разработчики отлично реализовали и показали в рамках самой игры и главного героя. Кто прошел и такого же мнения об игре понимает о чем я, ну а кто нет - вам спойлерить не хочу. В общем игра заставила меня погрузится в раздумья над её исходом с полна, я на несколько дней словно выпал из своей обычной жизни отходя от финала игры, за что я очень благодарен! И я не понимаю некоторых людей, которые журят игру еще и за сюжет, по моему мнению они не прониклись историей и атмосферой игры, и не в метро играть пришли а в очередной тир с ""веселухой"" и вышками на пару вечеров."
252,Necrotech,"Apr  4, 2019",0,"Wouldn't even bother pirating this game. It's generic, boring, broken and tainted with anti consumer practices. If this is the kind of generic crap that is going to champion the epic store exclusive page, a store may I remind you that doesn't even have a shopping cart or search feature, then they won't go very far. Wait for it to hit steam, discount to 5$ with all the DLC and hopefully bug fixes and maybe you can enjoy it then."
253,ir88ed,"Mar  2, 2019",10,"All these people leaving 0-3 ratings have an agenda, and are trying to punish the company for pulling out of the steam store at the last minute.  The game is beautiful, challenging, and fun.  The storyline is simply fantastic.  RTX fails, but not because of this game.  It fails because Nvidia pushed out a tech that wasn't ready for prime time.  Even the >$1K 2080ti cant push 4k@60fps with RTX on.  RTX off, no problem.  This is why people are screaming that the game isn't optimized.  My 1080ti was able to do 4k@60fps on high settings without any issue.  No bugs, no problems.  Game is optimized.  Don't let these knuckle-heads make you miss out on a truly awesome, story-driven FPS."
254,VincentWarte,"Mar  3, 2019",10,"The game is a solid 8/10 for me (the 10 is to neutralize all that 0s and 1s that are unfair). I loved the previous Metro games and was a little bit sceptical about making a Metro game semi open-world with most missions being in the overworld.But they managed to maintain the atmosphere of the previous games, and improved some gameplay elements like crafting. Also they have backed quite a nice story that kept me go on.All in all I believe that every Metro fan will be satisfied."

256,rubanovmike,"Mar  9, 2019",9,"I am not even going to go into details as to why there are so many negative reviews on the game, as most of them are plain and simple trash comments made by unstable and young kids who can't take a simple change of plans.. The whole Epic Store situation just shows and proves that there are some people who just grasp at every single opportunity of throwing rounds of nonsensical and stupid negative comments at any game.From my point of view, this is one of the best games i have ever played so far.Yes, there are certain points that I would like to shine the light upon that forbade me from rating this game 10/10, such as the main character's sealed lips, but the amount of those points is negligible.First of all, I would like to state that I absolutely fell in love with the locations of the game. Unfortunately, I never really had a chance to just grab my backpack and head out to multiple location scattered across Russia, mostly because it is just too huge to explore. Thanks to the game, I could see how different places across Russia and even Kazakhstan would look like after an imaginary nuclear war. I like how the setting constantly changes, it brings more dynamic and fun gameplay to the game. Now, I want to hopefully visit at least two or three places that were present in the game.I think not mentioning graphics would be a crime, so I should give a brief description of how the game looks like: spectacular and breathtaking. I saw some people complaining about the graphics on a number of websites, and I honestly cannot understand their complaints. I mean, surely I've seen some good-looking games in the past, but it would be unfair from my side not to mention that Metro: Exodus easily beats nearly all of them.I loved the story, to be honest. Fortunately (yes, fortunately, there is no mistake here), I have never-ever even touched a single book from the series, which made my experience even more fun and exciting. By the way, after playing the game, I started learning more and more about the story of Artyom and his crew. Not only did I do a research on some of the characters, I've also actually started reading Metro 2033 to get the full picture.To conclude, this game is brilliant, I love almost every single aspect about it, and I definitely think that the game has a bright future full of DLCs and maybe even an official modding tool for fans to use. I recommend to play the game for anyone, and it doesn't even matter if you had read at least one book or not."
257,Paharich,"Mar  3, 2019",10,"Деологи главных персонажей являются одними из ключевых составлявших игры (для тех, кто играл на русской озвучке), а их было очень много, и могли они длится достаточно долго. Так же Метро порадовал увлекательным сюжетом, хоть и показался многим геймерам простым и скучным. Одним из недостатков я считаю взаимодействие с миром. К примеру, чтобыЗалезть по лестнице нужно нажать на кнопку действия, а в предыдущих частях такого не было. Ещё не стоит забывать верную спутницу Аню, которая на протяжение всего пути боялась, что с Артёмом случится что-то плохое. Игра даёт тебе выбор - убивать всех без исключения либо пощадить невинных. На каждой из локаций (кроме последней) персонажи говорят, что путь преграждают люди, но они не в чём не виноваты. И я считаю, что человек делает выбор опираясь на свои нравственные ценности. В заключение я хочу сказать, что я рад, за то что эту игру создали ""наши"" разработчики, они старались порадовать своих фанатов и у них это получилось."

It plays on our fears, hopes and dreams, reaches deeper and leaves you speechless. The only thing that I am not a fan of is that the main character was being silent all the times.

265,Violett,"Mar 30, 2019",9,"Игра русская, поэтому напишу тоже по русски. Думал какую оценку дать - 8 или 9, вначале склонялся к 8, потом решил всё же - 9. Игра на самом деле отличная. Ни одна из частей Far Cry не дотягивает. Игра также лучше предыдущих частей, и даже не только в плане графики, что было бы логично, но и в плане сюжета. Честно говоря, идея вывести Метро из московского метро мне казалась спорной. Предыдущие части именно этим меня и привлекали - что можно было по виртуальному метро походить, по тому метро, где ездишь каждый день и сравнить игру с реальностью. Но я не отношусь к тем фанатам, которые считают, что отклонения от книги даже на миллиметр не допустимы. Эта игра не совсем то ""Метро"", что мы знаем, и если не рассматривать игру в этом ключе - то игра отличная. Сюжет если и не идеальный, то всё равно очень хороший. Замечательная графика. Достаточный выбор оружия. Ненапряжный крафт и фарм запчастей. Порой попадаются графические баги. Отличная озвучка, неплохой музыкальный фон.Но есть и минусы - и главный помоему - очень дурацкая стелс система. Как минимум должна быть возможность перетаскивать трупы. Часто в стелсе вообще в принципе не пройти - вот стоят два боевика и смотрят друг на друга - как их убить? Двоих сразу нельзя, а одного - сразу тревога поднимается. Я как ни старался ни разу помоему ни один большой лагерь не очистил в стелсе. Если нужен образец как делать стелс в игре - лучше Dishonored помоему ничего не придумали.В итоге - 9 из 10 имхо."

268,R_1777,"Apr 28, 2019",8,"Lastima que mi PC no puede correr suficientemente fluido el juego. Pero al menos lo suficientemente bien para poder jugarlo cómodamente. - En zonas cerradas se siente como en los demás juegos de la saga. - En cuánto a zonas abiertas, se siente diferente de muchos otros juegos de mundo abierto. Aquí todo el tiempo tienes que estar pendiente del entorno ya que desde la primera zona abierta tienes: gambas y un pez gigante en el agua, vigilantes, humanimales en tierra y demonios en el aire. - Tiene subtitulos en español latino, Lastimosamente no cuenta con doblaje a esta región. Pero está bien ya que estámos acostumbrados al doblaje de españa y sería raro escuchar otras voces. _________Los problemas técnicos que tiene son:_________ - Al caminar se escucha que Artyom está caminando en pasitos chiquitos. - Te atoras con cualquier escaloncito, rama o bidón que te encuentres en el piso y puede perjudicar el sigilo ya que luego no queda de otra mas que saltar el obstáculo, lo que puede hacer que te descubran por movimiento brusco. -En ocasiones Artyom no trepa los obstaculos que quiere uno. -En ocasiones las ejecuciones no funcionan cuando deverían lo que puede perjudicar la partida. - Falla un poquito en la optimización ya que en unos lugares el juego me corre a 50 fps y en otros baja hasta 20 fps. - Al disparar al enemigo en ocasiones las balas no hacen daño aunque les dé, lo que ha hecho que me descubran cuando no fue mi culpa... Es eso o de por si fue pensado así. - Necesitamos que el ""Antialiasing"" se pueda desactivar ya que es una de las cosas que más consumen (ni si quiera las anteriores entregas me corren bien con Antialiasing activado y todo en alto) - Hay una parte en el primer mapa en el que se me bugeo un bote despues de aparcar y ahora ya no me deja girar, solo moverme de adelante a atrás. - El doblaje en ingles: En serio, ¿Era necesario que intenten imitar el acento ruso? intentar imitar el acento de un país en cualquier dobaje es una completa estupidez. Solo es admitible cuando algún personaje es extranjero y aprende a hablar en el idioma del país en el que se encuentra. Quitando los fallos (lo cual espero que arreglen más adelante con futuros parches) el juego es bastante bueno y de más calidad de lo que han sacado otras desarrolladoras sin repetir los modelos de los juegos anteriores (¿verdad EA con tu Antem en el cual has reciclado modelos el Fifa para los npc's?).Aparte de que una muy buena historia. P.D: En el final del juego los desarrolladores pusieron su mayor empeño y pusieron todo lo que han aprendido al desarrollar sus juegos, ya que, de todo el juego, el final es sin duda alguna lo mejor de esta entrega y vale por completo la pena y no me decepciono en lo absoluto. P.D.2: No se por que mucha gente se queja de que el juego se cierra, a mi nunca me ha pasado (me pasa más la pantalla azúl de windows 10) Tengo un Core i3 2100, 8gb ram ddr3 y una GTX 1050 ti, y nunca se me cerró el juego."

273,aetherbrain,"Apr  1, 2019",8,"Just finished the game, and I realized that this has the most cringy and cliché ridden story I've experienced in a long time. The voice acting adds to the effect. They really need to work on storytelling. It's so bad, it's good. It's hard to be motivated by the story. Still this is probably the best FPS I've played in a long time and well worth it's money. The game-play is among the best among first-person shooters IMO. Exploring, looting, upgrading, finding hidden parts and weapon mechanics are top-notch. It's just as fun to go full 80's Schwartzenegger as it is playing stealthy, and you will need to do both. The graphics are amazing and audio is great, except from som harsh transitions from ie. indoor to outdoor on the audio side. It had som bugs and glitches, but nothing that broke the game. I play it from my SSD on my laptop which is equipped with a GTX1060-3GB, i7-8750H, 16GB RAM.I was able to get above 30fps on 1080p ultra with advanced physics and full v-sync.

Sadly, this is the worst of the lot by far. I now know why they ditched STEAM.

282,XPrPr,"Mar  2, 2019",8,"Кратко по составляющим:- Графика. В пк версии на экстриме игра выглядит бомбезно, особенно работа со светом. Хотя графика и неровная. Порой текстуры откровенно мыльные, эффект огня так себе, задники убогие и т.п., но в целом выглядит игра великолепно. 10/10- Левел дизайн. Почти все места в игре проработаны с невероятной скрупулезностью. Куча всяких чайников, кружек, часов, плакатов, надписей на стенах и т.п.  Две открытые локации довольно разные. Первая - зимняя, выглядит невероятно атмосферно и интересно для изучения. Пустынная же почти никаких эмоций особо не вызывает, ибо тема заезженная. 9/10- Визуальный дизайн. Советский постапокалипсис для русского человека выглядит очень душевно и знакомо. Окружение на ура погружает тебя в этот печальный разрушенный мир, заставляя специально замедлять шаг, чтобы внимательней осмотреться и погрузиться в эту шикарную атмосферу. 10/10- Сюжет и персонажи. Душевная история об обычных выходцах из метро, которые ходят найти новый дом. Персонажи все разные, немного стереотипные, но крайне правдоподобные. Много западающих в душу сцен(всякие попойки, милые беседы с Аней и т.д.)  Как душевное приключение компании друзей в поисках нового дома - игра работает прекрасно. Проблемой является немного скоротечная и сумбурная концовка. 8/10Геймплей:- Шутерный аспект. Вот тут уже неровности. В игре явные проблемы с физическими моделями и регистрации попаданий. Порой это крайне выбешивает. Оружие ощущается нормально, ни хорошо, ни плохо. 7/10- Выживание. В рамках полу коридорного шутера элемент выживания сделан хорошо. У тебя постоянная нехватка ресурсов, и приходится думать, что тебе нужнее в данный момент. А так же стараться экономить патроны. С последним создаются проблемы, когда у тебя частенько не засчитывается попадание. Но чего-то бомбезного в этом аспекте нет, он просто хороший. 7/10- Общий гейм-дизайн. К сожалению, игра не достаточно часто старается ставить игрока в разные интересные ситуации. В основном это просто коридорный шутан с элементами стелса. Под конец, на моменте с обезьянами, где тебя принуждают к стелсу против тупых врагов - это крайне отвратительный пример гейм-дизайна. 6/10Локальные моменты:- Анимации в игре откровенно слабые. Они не прям ужас и мрак, но часто не выражают тех эмоций, которые вкладывает тот же актер озвучки. Порой бег дерганный, порой склейки есть. Хотя те же скелетные анимация в общем выглядят неплохо, особенно от первого лица. Достаточно неоднозначный аспект. 5/10Средний бал - 7.5/10. Половинку накину за свои личные эмоции. Ибо игра действительно бриллиант среди множества онлайн(и не только) помоев в современной индустрии. Пример отличной сингловой story-driven игры, которую проходишь с удовольствием и из которой не хочешь уходить."
283,DarkFenix,"Feb 24, 2019",0,"Metro Exodus is more than just a game, it's a symbol of just how bad things could be in the future of PC gaming. For many years we've watched the exclusivity wars go pointlessly back and forth between consoles, harming rather than helping the gaming industry, but mercifully spared from them by the openness of the platform we use. Not any more. Epic, in their phenomenal greed, seek to bring that brand of anti-competition and anti-consumerism to an open platform, offering 'financial incentives' (read: bribes) to third party publishers to deny sales to their competition. Worse still, they're doing this at the 11th hour, after exploiting said competition to garner publicity and visibility for the product. Say what you will about scummy publisher practices these past years, but not even the likes of EA or Activision have sunk low enough to pull a move like this. And whether you love or hate Steam, they have never sought an unfair advantage over their competition. Epic is harmful to the gaming industry. Deep Silver is harmful to the gaming industry. Metro Exodus is harmful to the gaming industry. So do the gaming industry a favour as I have, and avoid giving your money to any publisher that seeks to push the limits of anti-consumerism."

285,PRoxy_oQ,"Feb 22, 2019",4,"Just to start of am not bashing the game about epic and steam c-rap as that is something that is not my concern nor do i think it should affect the game review it self. Game is not bad but it's not good either it's somewhat generic and has to many annoying things that give it 4/10 score from me.It's a Metro game that is rushed, non optimized has way to many small bugs, frame drops, no real PC settings or controls graphics are average at extreme settings, monster design is blank in both their visuals animation and move sets. IA is generally bad and random, open world looks interesting but is dull and not really open, NPCs talk for ages but the guy who should talk is mute even in conversations, UI is garbage, faces and NPC and general animations are 2012. You are just running around without any good reason story is blank and it lacks everything that made METRO games good. Opening seams to be made to look good and story driven but it was just making me and most of other people i know play it quit the game on the start. No it does not run well on 1060 1070 1080 2060 2080 it has some frame stutters even on RTX Quadro 8000 i use for work. System specs do not mater for this game all you need is 8-16 GB ram 1050 ti+ and any quad core and put it on ultra/extreme you will the same experience. As for ray tracing welp none cares about that. Maybe patches will fix some of the issues and even then it could maybe get 5/10 i don't think they can fix animations graphics on faces and monsters and so many bugs and UI/PCc controls c-rap in time to make it to 6/10 which is where it would max out with everything that is fixable fixed. maybe 6/10 just maybe then for now 4/10 finish uninstall and make sure that next time I get hyped about anything i think twice or wait for crack to test as reviews are welp people who don't even seam to play the games or are sponsored etc. positives: it came out and i finished it and uninstalled it Negatives:IAAnimationsUIBugsOptimizationFacesNPCsMute Main characterMonstersEmpty/dull open world for things to do"

The game is slow, clunky, boring, not scary at all."
288,Savvington1,"Mar  4, 2019",1,So disappointed with this game as it hasn't really moved on from the previous 2. The game has so many bugs/glitches and combat is way too easy to kill humans and pointless to kill mutants/monsters etc.  The open world offers nothing new and the side missions are just pointless.  I really wanted to like this game as I heard it could be FPS of the year! Really...... that just says to me that there are not many good FPS's coming out in 2019. Avoid this drivel.
289,zkryakgul,"Mar  5, 2019",10,"I fall in love with this game!! Wonderful story, Wonderful game play (Although fps sometimes drop.), Wonderful atmosphere. Everything is Wonderful about this game! I think their successes are closing all their deficiencies."
290,Dancuka,"Feb 26, 2019",10,"Forget the review-bombers. Is it a shame its not on steam? Yeah, it is. But this game is too good to be clouded by manchildren who cant manage to double-click a seperate .exe file on their desktop to another launcher. Look, this game is one of the best fps-games in a while. Its even the best fallout-game since Vegas, and its not even Fallout! Everything is super polished and you can see the passion poured into this game. The open-area world works really well and the sense of exploration is really satisfying. The story is good but not great, but the gameplay is the real spice in this one. The only thing that is still annoying in the series is the dialogue. Most of the time its fine, but often the game thinks its a good idea to play 10 different dialogues all over each other with super-heavy overacted russian accent. You cant understand anything and it just makes you cringe. Maybe the accent is ""realistic"" but its just really annoying to listen to after a while. Its not as bad as in the 2 previous games, but its still one of the worst aspects in the game. All in all the game is still one of the best releases this year, even tho we have most of 2019 left. Highly recommended."
291,BoTuLiNuM,"Mar  4, 2019",8,"So ends an epic story. As a fan of the books and games, the story really pulled me in and had me invested, seeing me playing the game well past my bedtime.The ending even had me shed a tear or two. Breakdown of my rating:Story 10/10Gameplay 8/10Enjoyability 8/10Animation and Graphics 8/10Stability and bugs 8/10Epic Store -1 point (I don't need yet another game store even though its better than origin, steam just works) Details: Story - See first comment. Gameplay - Feels a little rigid, but considering your character is wearing a protective suit for a large part of the game, and with me having played plenty of Tarkov, I can let it slide. (comment)Enemy animations and movement is done well making alerted enemies or charging units difficult to hit. (plus)Having hit plenty of units and not having the hits register is very concerning, as it meant I would have to start a section again if I could not take them out quickly after them getting alerted. (minus) Enjoyability - The game had plenty of sudden scary pop-ups early game but the fear factor reduced as I became desensitized during about the middle of my Caspian progress, but with the new areas and new challenges coming with them the game still drew me back making this the 1st story game I finished since Metro Last Night. (I read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi books, and find most AAA titles are not in an enjoyable genre)The intractability with some of the characters was fun and the games music was good. Animations and Graphics - The scenery is great and graphics are on par with other open world titles. (plus)The detail which went into some of the buildings and the layout of some locations allowed  me to 'read' a story in my surroundings, making it all the more enjoyable to explore everywhere I could. (plus)Some of the animations need a lot of work, like the colonel hugging air before the last mission. (2x minus) Stability and bugs - The game crashed twice, but at least it saved, and never required a restart like most of the games I have recently played(he said coughing the word origin).I also became stuck once on open ground, but was able to fix it by deploying my backpack."

По началу не особо зацепил сюжет, но после того, как началась глава в пустыне втянулся и прошел игру нон-стопом.Графика на высшем уровне, сюжет тоже.Диалоги по своему смыслу и информативности очень интересные и хорошо прописаны, РУ озвучка же в некоторых местах очень плохо выглядит. Особенно, когда в драматичном моменте актер озвучки в смешной манере говорит ""слышииишь?""Очень порадовала вариативность концовки, которая зависит от системы кармы накопленной за всю игру.Из минусов такая себе анимация лиц для 2019, да и сама анимация в игре забагованная.

Do not be lazy and read the notes that you find);- A big plus for the series, doing customization of weapons and equipment;- The balance between: shooter, stealth and horreram observed;- I can write endlessly) Minuses:Why cons immediately? To pay attention to the problems of the game in the first place. - Animations, animation glueing and animations losing. (This is very visible on character animations, especially on faces.Here mutant animations are great.) - AI opponents remained at the level of Metro 2033 2011 yers. (Although this can be offset by the complexity of the game ""Ranger"") - There are items that do not have a collision. The enemy passes through them and you cannot interact with them. - Mutants - the same mutants, can be found for 8000 kilometers. In different locations there are the same mutants, independent of climatic zones and zones of infection by radiation. (Or is it laziness, or is it a rush to develop a game?) - The uniformity of 3D models. (The same models can be found in different locations). - Some sounds look very cheap. And taken from the previous parts of the game, and even from a stalker. - Illogical character actions. Game development is a very difficult job, and I respect your work.These were the main disadvantages, in my opinion. a plus: - The plot - which begins as a wave, rolls on you. Then he departs to roll again. (But sometimes sags) - I will continue soon"

304,Pukiru,"Mar 10, 2019",0,"As it turned out for fans of the series is the most. I have not played the previous games, tried one and threw I do not remember for what reasons, but looked a little videos about the lore of the game and the plot before the passage of the Exodus, in order to be aware of what it is all about. It turned out that this is not enough, in order to be imbued with the spirit of the game you need to really play it and love it with all the shortcomings that were in it from the beginning. And the disadvantages really are, and they are from the beginning, from the very beginning the game had not quite a clear plot, bugs and weak graphics when compared with analogues at the time of release of parts, and of course the gameplay mechanics is not like everyone else. Nevertheless, the plot is a no but there is certainly someone he went, besides, the game is essentially Russian, to the whole atmosfere pissed corners in residential areas and parables about life's troubles the local npsi seems very relished by fans of a great and terrible Stalker. The outcome of the same in fact continues the events of the previous parts and of course the fans of the game continued the story and a new graphic design (in fact the corridors as the open world it can not be called)had to taste. The fact that there are some gameplay features that are available in modern games, as well as clumsy animation, lack of damag panels, weak, naive and tedious story and a bunch of all that I described earlier, no one was confused. Metro is and was from the beginning, and of course the fans of all these flaws are simply not visible. They see that the game brought grafon and it really is best of what I saw in the videos of the previous parts. But metro Exodus used a very impressive PR company that even people who can not stand the spirit of murder in games downloaded to see what it is. And when a detailed examination of the game to people far from the series, the game did not seem like some kind of masterpiece, it srednyachek that they passed, if passed and removed. In fact, the game is not for a fan of ""Metro"" is just a demo of all these modern bells and whistles from NVIDIA with light, rays and advertising RTX. In fact, to demonstrate to the General public modern features failed as well as possible, all who played at least at high or ultra settings, even without RTX and DirectX 12 saw how the light was used in this game. It is clear that on RTX 2060 it looks much more effective but nevertheless even I seeing a game on 1080ti and on 1066 saw these moments (about lower settings I cannot write as I did not see a game below high). So for the demo version of all that I wrote, all my quibbles to the game turns out to be superfluous. For this game of it all and don't need she don't need the traces from falling bullets, tear limbs from enemies, the animation(everything from grass and ending with facial expressions, npsi) normal also do not need, voice it is also in essence came up such as it is, that has recorded a bunch of sounds new but some were not and took them from the previous parts as well as dubbing which does not fall in places in the mouth movements. In addition, everyone knows that the voice of Western critics did not like and relished only Russian-speaking. And of course the plot, or rather not even the plot and the script that could be prescribed at times better and better. But all this game is not going to do, and maybe going but instead of working on all of the above decided to shove the rays and light into the game, and paid maximum attention to it. Given the five-day hacking and the number of downloads, not to mention the purchases I think the main emphasis was not so much on selling the game, but on new graphics cards. So the game is good, but for everyone."

Однако, игру немного портят баги и постоянные трабблы с озвучкой, которая звучит одновременно и отлично, и временами вгоняет в ступор, как тот же актёр, что экспрессивно выдал предыдущую сцену, так монотонно, без нужных выделений (которые даже есть в субтитрах) прочитал этот текст. А, да, ну и стелс в этой игре вполне ""на уровне"" предыдущих метро.Однако, все эти недочеты ИМХО несущественны, я получил тонну удовольствия просто слушая разговоры каждого из членов команды, ловил НЕ попсовые отсылки, понятые в основном постсоветским игрокам.

THIS REVIEW CONCERNS THE GAME ITSELF AND NOT WHERE IT IS SOLD AT.metro exodus is the third and best installment of the metro series, after using the profit to fix the issues of the previous games, it became worthy in terms of technical aspect to adapt a novel as good as the international best selling novel metro.the game most excels at atmosphere, the dialogue between the character.it certainly been a while since we got a post apocalyptic the balances between game play and plot as well as metro exodusthe game-play isnt the best ou there or the worst, it is enjoyable and unique when you battle monsters underground in the dark and generic shooter against humansgraphics improved a lot over the previous games and it did look really beautiful at moments, however it was inconsistent and i felt like i was playing past gen game at another momentthe most notable difference in this installment is exploration, which in my opinion, is always worth it for developers to invest since i forget myself in front a good map with good lootis it worth the full price?definitely since it has good replay-ability due to the many decisions you make in it."
314,Lufiel,"Mar  3, 2019",8,it would be 9 if there was better attachment to previous games and better optimalization on day one
315,Patcub2k,"Mar  2, 2019",9,"Before reading please consider that i started playing with version 1.0.1.2 of the game (Feb 26 2019 Patch) To be honest i dont give a rats ass if some people are mad because they have to use the epic store to play this game. Just click on the f***** desktop icon, play the game and stfu. Also i dont care if some of you guys expect it to run 60fps+ on a gtx1060 gpu in 4k maxed out. It looks way too good to make that possible, and also the performance is definitely adequate for what you get smooth on your screen in the end. I use a ryzen 5 2600x, 16gbs of ram and a vega 56 and it runs really good on wqhd in high settings. No stuttering, no input lag, not a sinlge crash or freeze throughout the whole (!) walkthrough... just smooth. There is absolutely no reason for whining or complaining. Any negative comment or review about the performance not being optimized for PC is either bull**** or written by haters. Gameplay is also (almost) as you would expect it from a metro game that goes ""open world"". Still very close to the predecessor when it comes to the overwhelming atmosphere, storytelling and excellent gunplay. Also i loved the side stories, that you only get to see when you take your time listening and watching your companions for longer than just a few seconds (the game's atmosphere/storytelling does definitely not work for rushers). And yes, there are still a few minor bugs (watch your step^^) and the enemy AI (still) does not always work 100% properly, but it really is not bad at all. Overall i rate this game with a 9, because of the positive aspects, which are some of the best i have ever seen (and i really play a lot)."

All graphics are excellent, sound excellent also, Story is great it's not buggy like so many say in fact I can find nothing wrong with Metro Exodus I really enjoy playing it. Their are only two things I would like to see different (1) the cut scenes are a little too long for my liking, and (2) the other negative would be the greedy & lying nature of Deep Silver / 4A Games for promising the Steam community we could buy this game off the Steam platform that's all. Metro Exodus is well worth owning it is the best in the Metro series.."

This game has no real open-world, the graphics are okay but not this awesome and than you want me to buy a i9 for this game?

Такое ощущение что игра несколько раз менял курс во время разработки. Изначально планировали сделать старую линейную игру, затем открытый мир, а потом получился этот пустой кусок локации, где исследования вообще не поощряются. И Этот немой ГГ.

328,awilmes11,"Mar  1, 2019",9,"This game is a real work of art. Let me begin by saying that the atmosphere and the environments they created are the real heroes of this game. You immediately feel immersed in the post-apocalyptic landscapes. This had just the right amount of scary moments for me; foreboding atmosphere with the occasional jump-scare. Graphically an A+. The game-play is solid, a nice mix between stealth and combat. The weapons feel responsive and satisfying. The pacing of the game is nothing short of masterful; moments of intensity are punctuated by some real serene scenes.  The only downside is that I was left wanting more of it. Another chapter or two would have been great. The story was really moving, and the characters encountered felt real. Got some real ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" feelings from time to time. A real glimpse into the nature of humanity. The only negatives were some hard crashes that were rectified by frequent driver updates. A semi-negative is that I wish there was more. This is a credit to the quality of what's there, but I would have liked some more time to use the sweet weapons I got near the end of the game. Even if you've never played a game like this before, be sure to pick this one up."

Я фанат вселенной метро. Возможно поэтому я не обращаю внимание на её недостатки. Графика хороша. Стрельба неплохая. Багов (я встретил) мало. Сюжет бомба. Атмосфера передаётся идеально.

331,GhostTechGaming,"Feb 25, 2019",0,"The game is unplayable for me, Multiple crashes on start up, then constant lag.SpecsGtx 1080 TiIntel Core i7 - 7770k---------------------------------This is the worst optimized game, I have played, well wait couldn't even play it. I am currently waiting for a refund through epic games, Which, I know why it is no longer on steam, Because the reviews would have been terrible. I would say pick it up for xbox or ps4. For PC it is unplayable for me at least."
332,LuminoDiode,"Mar  7, 2019",0,"1) Terrible optimization. Games on my hardware (i5 6600 + gtx 950) are capable of producing an excellent (not bad, at least) picture in 60 fps, recall the same Witcher 3 or at least Wildlands. Such a terrible situation as with this Metro I have not seen for a long time. The picture on my settings is not better than I had in Metro Redux, but at the same time in previous versions I had a stable 60 + fps, here I has 50 with drawdowns below 30 and frametime jumps.2) There is also a huge amount of physics bugs. Some objects do not have a physical model (although it would be better for them to have it), some of them are generally floating in the air. Also, a large number of objects have a texture on one side only, but on another side they are transparent. And, of course, if you’re just running through the game (it seems that this is exactly what the developers were counting on by releasing the game), then you may be will not notice it, but it is worthwhile to at least linger on the level and all the problems will pop up at the moment.3) Tightened skirmishes. Monsters spawns endlessly, why we have no chance to kill them all? You force us to just run through the levels (read the second part…), For it is often simply impossible to kill all the monsters, or it takes too many resources.4) Tightened missions, which in the end cause only a desire to quickly move on to the next mission.5) The system of customization and modification of weapons can be compared with Wildlands - it seems like there are a lot of modifications, but actually it’s impossible to do something truly unique. In fact, all you need is a rifle with a silencer.6) Separately, I will say that the game has no problems with zoom. I mean if the sight has an approximation of ""X6"", then it really approximates 6 times, and not like in some games - only two or even less.7) The plot is pretty good. In fact, this is the only thing that makes me play this game. Without it I would delete after the first hour of the game. Really, gameplay is just disgusting.I would like to add that critics who rate this game 8 and above do not have the right to be called critics. The word itself contains the verb ""to criticize"" - what they do not do. At a minimum, due to such technical problems, it should not receive ratings higher than 7.My score for this game is absolute zero."
333,reviewman2,"Mar  8, 2019",4,"Not as much fun as previous metro titles.No achievements because of Epic store, which removes a lot of the replayability for me as I always took multiple playthroughs to complete them.Found the movement and aiming a bit lacking - there is a delay when I sweep the mouse from side to side that almost feels like using a controller on a console. Don't remember this in previous metro titles.Multiple instances of crouching perfectly still with the reticle directly on an enemies head and subsequently missing the headshot - fully clean weapon; another annoying mechanic.Not a lot to do in the ""open world"" except shoot up a camp of enemies and loot an item - most of the time nothing significant and a waste of time.Even with side quests and exploring all question marks on the maps plus some additional exploration the game felt incredibly short which would be fine if the game were cheaper.The transition into what I am assuming are cutscenes (fps drops to 31-33 during them) was very choppy, almost like the game froze for a second as they changed from in game to the pre-rendered video. If this game was £30 instead of £50 and has achievements like the steam store had it would probably be a 6/10."

No room for improvisation like throwing items or setting up traps using the environment. Meh. For some reason I thought it would be something like Prey with room for creativity.

340,DanielBoone,"Mar  5, 2019",1,"Boring, boring and boring. Sorry, but thats not Metro. First: Anna is boring. Can anyone remove her from the game please? She is useless.Second: The gang is boring. Endless dialogs with an mute Artjom. All the npc babble like chatterboxes, Artjom - silence. No way to cut the endless conversations.Third: The gameplay is boring. Even at hardcore its more an walk-through than a challenge.Fourthly: Endlessly loot picking is boring. press E for two bullets, press E for two bullets, press E for two bullets. Booooooring! Conclusion: Is miss everything I loved on Metro and LL. I cant feel anything from the hype on Metro Exodus. I am very disappointed at the moment. One point for the nice but not mindblowing gfx. edit: I finished that palgue and I am happy that I shot one good to much so that Artjom died, R.I.P. my old friend. My rating now for the chapters (from 1 worst to 10 best): prologue: 2, lacks of logic, but so what, it's an prologue.volga: 5,semi open world muddy terrain environment, Ithought it was boring while playing but after finishing that game its maybe the best part.yamatau: 5, ok, that part is funny here and there but to short to give the game an other spin. But at least a lot of shooting here.caspian desert: 2, semi openworld monotone desert environment, not challenging anyway, but not to much Anna and boring dialogs, so it gets 3 points minus one for the absolutely annoying sandstorms.the valley: 4, simple linear level, no open world parts, easy to solve without the senseless bear ""boss"" fight ( I still doesnt know wy i ""won"" after a dozen of similar fights, most annoying scene of the game. Detailed but oldfashioned graphics, pitiable.dead city: 1, desperately helpless attempt to create a stalker like environment. strictly linear design , boring as hell, wtf are they thinking? Uninspired winter environment. beside this: poor PC port, poor game mechanics. Sometimes ""bandits"" were beamed to other places in the map or disappear like ghosts while you sneak behind them just to respan a littler further. Ah, and,  ehm, Artjom is'nt mute, he can ""aaaargh"" and ""oouch"" but is unable to say a word unless how much the rest of the gang or Anna persuade on him. After all and as I said before this game miss everything that makes metro great. A good story, unexpected changes, open questions. What happened to the dark one's for example? Furthermore it looks like the parts are developed by different teams. I've played both metro and LL three times at last and will hold them high forever (as I do with stalker) but I am happy after deleting this piece of garbage from my disc. mission not accomplished, 4A games!"

343,dimanist,"Feb 24, 2019",4,"Из плюсов игры можно выделить отличную работу художников, а так же внимание к деталям. Так же музыку которая навевает ностальгию. Средняя возможность кастомизации предметов и слабый, но все таки крафт, но все равно хорошо когда такое есть, чем когда такого нет. Неплохая озвучка. А все остальное по игре один сплошной минус и халтура:1) Сюжет. Несмотря на то, что по сюжету вселенной прошло 20-ть лет после конца света, на лицо полная деградация и падение нравов, люди из образованных (хотя бы 9-ть классов) скатились в дремучую деревню это все равно, что те представители, которые сейчас сидят в сети, зная все и вся и разбираясь во всем, через двадцать лет начнут молиться сому и поехавшему человеку с именем Селантий это скорее претензия ко всей серии книг Глуховского, но исходя из этой парадигмы и идет развитие, оно все такое, атмосфера напоминает аркхем асилум, где все сошли с ума и деградировали. ГГ немой мальчик на побегушках, без права выбора, которым по сути пользуются все кому не лень, лицемерно изображая закадычных друзей, но оправляя решать самоубийственные задания в одиночку. Персонажи как и сюжет шаблонные и придуманы на коленке, хотя одержимая свои мужем жена ГГ еще более менее прикольная, хотя он крутой всех вокруг мочит в одиночку, да и вокруг грязные безумцы и вся жизнь в подземелье провела, наверное тоже тронулась.2) Мир. Мир на 95-99% состоит из врагов, аля безумный макс и бедных нестрашных инвалидов гулей. Кругом одни безумцы и все по уши в дерьме.3) ИИ. Самый тупой ИИ за последнее время мной виданный, хотя эти ребята свояли сталкер с интересными перестрелками, но тут же стелс - нафик ненужный, мир слишком безумен и врагов кругом слишком много чтобы вжиться в стелс. Большинство врагов тебя не видят в упор и начинают агриться когда стреляешь в них, не меняя позиции, граны и молотовы тоже не используют, даже на супер сложности.4) Геймплей. Слабый сюжет должен компенсироваться гейплеем, а вот нет, количество диалогов которые нельзя пропустить и вникай в это деньги уплочены, стань сомелье вторичности, может понравиться. Ходи по рельсам заданий, с отвратительно реализованной стрельбой в тупых болванчиков и любуйся работой художников.Можно еще под стелсом вырубать злодеев с кулака толпами, под звук удара из старых индийских фильмов - на суперсложности, не хватает только крика ""Кия"". С небольшими лирическим отступлениями, в виде покатушек на таблетке или отпугиванием тараканов фонариком.5) Графика. Обилие косметики в игре, но движок то старый с отвратительная анимацией. Нас не обманешь. Как будто старую бабку накачали гормонами и накрасили косметикой и заставили играть молодуху в молодежном сериале. От чего мой компьютер неплохо так нагрузился.6) Оптимизация. Сыровато, есть баги"
344,Disilluminate,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"(Non-Bias)Exodus is very well optimized (2080Ti, 4k HDR monitor) and the visuals compared to Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light. From its open world Exodus still brings back the game to its roots over and over and it honestly pleases as well. Those times in the dark and suffocating buildings and metro tunnels always brought a sense of fear and wanting to not enter at times. But even though that is true Exodus does feel like there are some missions that drag on the story and it takes the game a little while to advance its story which shouldn't be this way. The actual story is very well written and does satisfy the direction of the story as well and doesn't leave anything left out. The characters interact more with Artyom and it envelopes you into the life and the way everyone looks and cares for you and much more happy atmosphere. There are numerous bugs in the visuals but nothing that can make you not want to continue playing the game. It satisfies until the every end and makes you appreciate everyone and everything since the very first Metro, I guarantee it."
345,ScienceAdvisor,"Feb 17, 2019",5,"Deep Silver, the publisher, pulled the move to Epic at the last moment.  NOT 4A.  Also, 4A does not get more money from that move automatically.  The contract they signed with Deep Silver may allow for it, or it may not.  Only they know. As for the game it is good, bordering on great at moments but falls flat with highly repetitive combat, underwhelming enemies mostly due to questionable AI, and bugs (audio, pathing, some texture, FPS issues, and saved games that are occasionally put in the wrong folder!). The worst two complaints are the dropped sense of alien qualities (anomalies are poorly integrated, dark ones are MIA, etc), as well as the artificially linear nature of many parts of the game.  While you were in the Metro you only had singular pathways so that was immersive, but now you are supposedly free, but that is not really evident.  Your train is the new metro, and you are just moving from station to station clearing each with copypasta combat that amounts to kill everything that moves. It is just too bad that they did not develop the Stalker-ish aspects now that they have more room to play in, or continue the story path that the first two Metro games was developing.  I consider this more of a soft reboot than a sequel. As for performance, the Xbox version seems to run quite well.  The PC port is far less stable.  At least the Epic store was shamed into a refund policy before Exodus was released.  While 4A promised a pre-release fix for many of these issues they seem to have missed that deadline.  When these issues get patched then this will be a solid 7, but currently it is only a 5."

349,lukasmarek23,"Feb 25, 2019",3,"You know what? This game really is a huge disappointment. I am a big fan of the previous titles as well as the first book (the second one sucked as the cash cow it was). I have not finished the thing yet, but I consider this as a heads up to everybody who was as hyped as I was. Let's start with the good:1. The story is sort of intriguing. It's not genius, but I suppose it is the only thing keeping me going at the moment, as I've have not played/read a good post-apocalyptic (let alone Russian) sci-fi in a while. 2. I somewhat like the old-style quest tracking, where the game does not really hold your hand (for the most part) as what you are supposed to do and how. Although tracking side-quests in your diary would help. 3. the weapon system is pretty neat. You can customise weapons however you like (and on the go) and need to keep them clean in order to work properly. Weapons, in general, are fun to shoot. Handling and sound look immersive and realistic. Then comes the rest.1. First off the optimisation is terrible with framerates fluctuating between 30-100 fps on a fairly beefed up PC. 2. Main characters are so f/ing annoying! Dialogues are so poorly written and the (over-)acting is laughable at best. Moreover, all the NPCs are cheering for you or hugging you all the time - don't know what kind of fantasy is being fulfilled there. 3. The atmosphere of Metro is mostly gone. The environment is empty and dull and looks like an offspring of Stalker but not in a good way. I have not felt any kind of suspense during my 6 hours of the playthrough. 4. Movement is so goddamn clunky and never works properly (being stuck on the geometry all the time, falling from ledges, climbing animation looks like from the 90s etc) 5. Fighting - apart from the weapon mechanics as described above- is just horrible. AI is plain stupid and cheats at the same time, which further contributes to the completely broken stealth system. On hardcore difficulty, the game is way too hard to be enjoyable (also thanks to the scarcity of ammo), while being too easy on normal. 6. Graphics look like 7 years ago. My recommendation is to wait for a sale. Maybe they will polish this into something playable by then."
350,MetaMind,"Feb 21, 2019",9,"WOW, all the negativity?? Just because they moved from Steam? (where were you when RDR2 delivered an absolutely boring thing they call a game?) How sad gamers can be so shallow.  The game is terrific, the characters, the environment, the crafting, the story, the exploration, and the gameplay, makes the game simply fun to plan.  I see it as maybe what Fallout 4 could have been for a starter.  It has a very nice mix of open world and confined areas which I think was needed to move things along from the same'ol but holding onto some of the past.  Some conversations which make the story immersive do go on a bit too long, but some bring interesting backstory which makes the character and story more personal.  My only huge peeve is the load times... I don't get it when GOW and HZD have huge environments and can load in a fraction of the time.  I hope they will be putting out more content and maybe a Game+ option.  Thanks to the developers for putting the heartfelt effort into this game.. it's much appreciated.  And I hope the whiners will consider going console to get a better appreciation of the actual game experience."
351,magpie666,"Feb 22, 2019",4,"I've played this for 2 days to see if the Boredom will disappear? I AM SUPER ANNOYED BECAUSE I LOVE THE METRO GAMES & I don't get it, this game is just BORING!!! and I struggle to keep coming back to it. The last 2 metro releases were pretty much great to play, I played both & Loved them & sadly though I got this next game in the series. I think it's safe to say that they have lost their way in how they developed this game. here are my 'OWN' mainly Bad but a couple Good thoughts on the game : Graphics :  they're ok but underwelming and at the same time great but everything is hard to see within the world, everything blends in with other things it's just weird and dull. Underground or in tunnels is very good though !! Sound: Awful NPC voices at times and the music is pretty much Meh... em and well Meh... Performance:  Never had any issues, no crashes, bugs that I can see. Storyline: jeez I've never ever been so bored (apart from fallout 76) with a story. It's just sooooooooo Utterly boring to wait and listen to the Npc's talking utter crap at times.. oh and I found my first cassette tape to play and I immediately sat back and thought OMFG this is fallout 76 holotapes. JEEEEZ.  So awful, just awful storyline. Fighting: I enjoy the fps side of the game although those pack animals that roam around in the evening in 3-7 packs are a pain. Crafting: It's basic but ok, nothing special Open world: Well it's not really an open world it can get quite linear which actually leads to (Again) boredom. I'm just lost for words and While I want to say it's great, It's NOT. At best this is a maybe 4/10 regarding fps side but as for the rest it's just an utterly Boring and Painfully attempt at changing what the 'Metro Series'is about and has FAILED. £10-15 Game at best Imho, Hope this helps anyone considering in paying for this. Do not look at 10/10 reviews they in my opinion are utter utter nonsense & possibly paid reviews , some kids/fanboys etc.. this is not a 10/10 game. Also some users on here have said they've posted reviews and they have been deleted  true/false I don't know but It is not uncommon for Companies to use this  awful practice. anyway cheers guys/girls hope this review gave you a perspective. :D"

The atmosphere and tension that this game makes you feel when you're sneaking around radioactive caves, enemy bases, abandoned train stations is absolutely worth the purchase alone. The game is gorgeous as well and it just bolsters the mood and scene that this game tries to create. The mix of linear FPS and the open world parts of this game were perfect for the pace of the game, and I was surprised that the linear mission Yamantau ended up being my favorite. The only reason it's not higher than a 9 is due to the long cut scenes and sometimes clunky movement. But overall, fantastic game just wish it was even longer!"
357,RealLembasBread,"Feb 22, 2019",9,"Even though the Epic Games deal was a bad move and hurt the game's reputation considerably, it doesn't change the fact that this is a worthy successor to 2 of the most underrated Survival-First Person Shooters out there. The atmosphere remains a core component and isn't harmed by the move to a (semi-) open world. Shooting is satisfying with good gun sound design overall and assembling a gun with the brand new crafting system is a real highlight. The only real downsides are the minor technical problems which have either been caused by the rather unproven Epic Games Launcher or 4A Games themselves.I can heartily recommend this game to fans of the series or people who appreciate world-building,a tense atmosphere, solid gameplay and a well-rounded story"

367,slart0r,"Feb 22, 2019",5,"I am a huge fan of the prior games but this is really quite bad. Playing on PC the graphics are really really good, but it is let down by awful physics and obscure quest objectives. For example - running around the landscape or backing off from enemies - don't worry here is a chair or plant you can get stuck on and die,    Killed a hard enemy and pickedup their heavy weapon which worked perfectly for them - no worries now you have it, it jams after 3 shots. Found the enemy zombies that claw you do death with one swipe - no problem after 15 melee hits against them they are uninjured (despite you having a knife in various cut scenes the only melee is to use the extremely ineffective butt of you gun?.The dialogue is way, way, way too long and there is no way to skip through it. This is insanely annoying after you have been through it and the game crashes and then you have to go through it again...I really regret paying full price"
368,fRagY,"Mar  3, 2019",9,"At the begining, I was worried about change of environment. From the creepy, claustrophobic and creepy tunnels to the open world? I can tell you that you do not need to worry. The first area you will get (Volga) has perfect atmosphere as was in previous games and ktThat continues further on. I have encountered only 1 or 2 crashes, but other than that nothing. Game runs smoothly for me ( and I do not have some super PC) and looks great. Maybe lip-sync and face animations have been bad on some characters, but I can live with that. And please, do not listen other people **** about Epic store. Yes, you have to instal another platform, but it takes about 5 minutes. And Metro is worth it. If you like Metro world, go for it!!!"

370,windowsill,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Metro Exodus is a great game. She's not perfect she has a lot of bugs, curve, facial animation, and of course the main disadvantage of silent Artyom. But despite all its shortcomings Metro Exodus, great game, very sincere, thoughtfully leisurely adventure, for me all its shortcomings faded into the background, they have become completely unimportant. It takes its history, atmosphere, all Russian gamers, I'm sure, were also impressed by the transfer of both the Russian spirit and the General atmosphere Of the world of metro Exodus. The train on which the heroes of the game travel, it becomes your home, the characters themselves are felt native to you. I passed the game, just a few hours ago and I am overwhelmed with emotions that very few games, books and movies can give, and is not this the main thing? Метро исход великолепная игра. Она не идеальна у нее полно багов, кривой лицевой анимации и конечно же главный минус, молчаливый Артем. Но несмотря на все ее недостатки Метро исход, великолепная игра, очень душевное, вдумчиво неторопливое приключение, для меня все ее недостатки отошли на второй план, они стали совершенно неважны. Она берет свое историей, атмосферой, все русские геймеры, уверен, были также впечатлены передачей, как русского духа, так и общей атмосферой мира Метро исход. Поезд на котором путешествуют герои игры, становится тебе домом, сами герои ощущаются родными тебе. Я прошел игру, буквально несколько часов назад и меня переполняют эмоции, которые очень немногие игры, книги и фильмы могут подарить, а разве не это главное?"
371,Delsin,"Feb 27, 2019",9,"Игра далеко не идеальна. Но она навсегда останется в моем сердце. В первую очередь за атмосферу и эмоции, которые мне она подарила. Достаточно неплохой сюжет, но пару дыр все-таки есть. Особенно понравилась последняя глава с накалом драмы. С технической точки зрение все хуже. Баги, краши, но думаю со временем пофиксят. Надеюсь, метро себя окупит. Спасибо 4a games за такой эксперианс!"

374,arruu,"Feb 24, 2019",8,"Why the hate?  Just by reading the comments you can see they are all trolling.The game is not well optimized yet... specially when you use DX12, that's true.But with DX11 i had no crashes or bugs so far  whatsoever  (8hrs aprox.)So i since I can play the game and experience what it has to offer fully, i will not use that excuse to bomb-comment this game. Patches will eventually come.The game has created a very nice atmosphere, however maybe this time isnt as oppressive as the prequels just because you arent underground and surrounded by darkness all the time.The stealth is super enjojable, although maybe not as tense as in other Metro games. The firefights and the weapons feeling not so much... which is a shame specially when you use them so much, and you take into account that this is the 3rd entry already with the same fault.The maps are quite interesting... a bit too scripted but still very enjoyable.The facial expressions look stiff, and -in Spanish- the voice acting is atrocious. But hey... those are little unimportant details to me. Metro is not about that.I havent finished the game yet, but so far the story is very interesting and so promising."
375,NihadBOSna,"Mar  4, 2019",10,"Ok so far so good. Just like other metro games i really love this one as well. They get that atmosphere so well done, and when you add these awesome looking graphics its breath taking. Story so far has been good, and Anna damn I love her. Damn its good experience.There are also some negative stuff like random freezes, lip sync could have been done better just like audio mixing. But im used to that with metro games.Overall there are more positives then negatives with this game.And i am willing to ignore some negative stuff because overall im really enjoying this experience."
376,Dubeau,"Feb 27, 2019",8,"I played the very first game, then didn't for the follow up. I like the game story. In a way it's a basic premise but it is emotional in many ways. I did enjoy some of the conversations outside the main story and the notes you find. The graphics are pretty. The performance was fair with occasional skipping. Nothing major with bugs. The sounds were a strong point in the game. It helped establish the tension around you. The music was good but not distracting. You can craft you weapons 5-7 ways and with various addons, but can only carry 3. The crafting system is simple and efficient. I enjoyed the combat and the sens of exploration. Not an open world, but at least 2 of the maps are large enough. I give it a 82%. Thank you for the Metro series Deep Silver."
377,Elban,"Feb 27, 2019",8,"Зачем игру ненавидеть за то, что она вышла в другом лончере? Что за идиотизм? Если бы вы действительно хотели поиграть в стиме - предзаказали бы да и всё.Если игнорировать дебильные отзывы вроде ""гафно! в епек сторе!!!"", то думаю средняя оценка будет где-нибудь между 8-9, и если подумать то вскрываются НАСТОЯЩИЕ проблемы этой игры.Например деревянные анимации и медленное перемещение, если раньше за анимации винить было довольно трудно т.к. всё делалось маленькой студией и без издателя, то сейчас то в чём проблема была выделить деньги на моушин каптчур что-бы персонажи двигались как надо?"

380,vladicxs,"Feb 26, 2019",8,"Попробую рассказать что и как.Плюсы:Микроменеджмент действий персонажа. Протереть маску, подзарядить фонарик и тд,Игра все еще осталась дико атмосферной и притягательной за счет своего фирменного стиляСделала шаг вперед в развитии сюжета(об этом и в минусах) и проработки игрового мира и персонажей, как хороших так и плохих.Отличная геймплейная механика крафта и взаимодействия мира в целом.Приятная смесь линейности периодически перекрываемая псевдо-открытым миром. Минусы:Почему они не озвучили главного персонажа? я понимаю что это позволяет отождествлять себя с ГГ и так далее, но в разрезе игры где очень много союзных персонажей с тобой говорит, молчание воспринимается как что то неуместное и периодически оставляет в недоумении.Смятая, сумбурная и слегка кривая концовка оставляет негативные ощущения, особенно на контрасте с последней миссией от которой волосы на руках дыбом вставали.Странная система хорошей/плохой концовки, которая оставила не очень хороший осадок в следствии ее непродуманности. Лично я бы предпочел увидеть одну и гораздо более хорошо сделанную, я не хочу всю игру всех спасать что бы заслужить хорошую, я хочу играть в удовольствие используя игровую механику на полную не ограничивая себя во всем. По поводу того что пишут в негативных отзывах.Стим или Эпик: только глупый человек будет ставить плохую оценку руководствуясь этой причиной.Баг или не Баг: у себя за всю игру я поймал только один баг ИИ и считаю это отличнм результатом.Анимация лиц: после андромеды у меня иммунитет. И почему то до того как я прочитал все эти комменты я считал что такая анимация это фирменный стиль, а не халтура. Но тут не буду спорить, у каждого свое мнение. И как результат: я считаю что игра стоит того что бы ее купить и пройти, может чуть позже когда появится скидки. она затягивает и погружает вас в свою атмосферу и проходится на одном дыхании."

382,Pier,"Mar 15, 2019",6,"Really nice graphics and writing, but otherwise a very clumsy title full of euro jank. Gameplay is at its best when sneaking, but gunfight is not great. Probably the worst aspect are the terrible cutscenes. Sound effects, voice acting, and music are all really poor. The reverb destroys any clarity in the dialogues which is already bad with the Russian accent. The game does a terrible job of communicating with the player. Most of the times you have no idea what you have to do. The UI is mediocre at best."
383,socokid,"Apr 14, 2019",9,"Shrugs. Maybe it's because I started playing it after the patches, but it runs beautifully on my machine, and is a genuinely fun game. Excellent graphics, sound, story, gun play, etc... And I love the little aspects like having to charge your electricity pack once in a while with a few hand pumps, etc... Great game, most of the low scores are from people with technical issues or those that really hate the Epic store. But the game itself is actually very fun. I'm having a blast, at least."

389,ricma,"Feb 28, 2019",9,"The game was made for consoles that is what i don't like (no recoil on guns, clunky movement more then last two games, buggy areas here and there) but AI feels like an improvement in some aspects, human AI can now one shot you on hardest difficulty but animal AI is worse, not aggressive enough to make it challenging for PC players. Game felt clunky at start but got better after Volga level after i got used to it. It has still good things that made Metro great, the desert level is very atmospheric and blew me away in many things, the looks, the feel of driving that wrecked car, hidden places where you can find loot, some riddles where you get upgrades, moral deeds and in turn getting upgrades from villagers, big sand storm that makes place very dark and forces you to use gas mask because of contamination etc. All in all a good game so far but needs some polish through patches to make it less buggy/clunky."

393,Denmark96,"Mar 10, 2019",10,"Пожалуй лучшая часть серии. Цепляющая история, харизматичные персонажи, приятные нововведения по типу крафта и полуоткрытых локаций. Атмосфера хоть и не такая как в первых двух частях, но все же это «Метро». Основной сюжет, истории фракций и их становление, маленькие история сторонних персонажей, записки и аудиозаписи, всё это погружает тебя в этот мир с головой и заставляет переживать за него. Финал игры дарит бурю эмоций, а после прохождения долгое приятное послевкусие.Из минусов отметил бы только баги, было встречено за 30 с лишним часов не так много, но некоторые из них мешали прохождению.Для сомневающихся фанатов старых частей, однозначно рекомендуется к покупке. А для новых игроков это хорошая возможность познакомиться со вселенной «Метро 2033»."

396,artillect,"Mar 25, 2019",9,"Metro Exodus builds on the best parts of the first two games, and adds a lot of new stuff to it. As always, the story and gameplay is great, the music is amazing too. The characters bring a lot of emotion to the table, and the addition of the open-world aspect is awesome. Like all Metro games, the last chapter is an incredibly wild ride. The trilogy reaches its culmination and feels like it finally paid off. My one gripe with the game is that the taiga chapter feels very linear, although the last chapter is pretty linear too, but packed with lots of story elements. Overall, the game felt very fun to play and I eagerly await any DLC they release for this game. Choosing to make it an Epic Store exclusive was somewhat of a bad decision, but it doesn't take away from the game at all. 4A Games did an amazing job with the game, and it shouldn't be rated badly because of a decision their publisher made."
397,tweezy,"Mar 26, 2019",9,"Игра конечно же не идеальна, но это всё то же Метро, хоть и на поверхности (хотя первый и последний уровни дают снова почувствовать страх подземных туннелей). Однако игра очень атмосферная. Сюжет вышел добротным, довольно интригующим. Персонажи прописаны отлично, запомнился каждый из экипажа Авроры. Неплохие локации, в частности понравились Ямантау (эта локация с её обитателями неслабо так меня ужаснула), Тайга и Новосибирск, который вышел, как мне кажется, мрачнее Москвы. Игра неплохо шла на средних настройках на системе AMD FX-6300 (не разогнанном), 8 Gb оперативы и GTX 1050. Из минусов конечно выделю техническую часть, а именно баги, из-за одного даже пришлось просить чужой сейв, чтобы играть дальше, ибо проходить главу с самого начала очень не хотелось (играл еще в непропатченную версию, поэтому насчет багфиксов не могу быть уверен). Звук местами паршивый, часто голоса слышны намного хуже окружения, нередко бывает трудно определить местоположение врага (особенно проявилось на Волге). Ну и глуповатый ИИ. Концовка очень задела душу, что однозначно огромный плюс."
398,GlennF,"May  1, 2019",10,"Very immersive and great graphics. Have had none of the minor bugs people complain about and the game runs faster than early reviews suggest, good results even at maxed out settings including ray tracing turned on (i5 8400 / 2060). As for saves - not sure about console but on PC you get a manual save intended to be used at safe spots in addition to the autosave so no problems there.  Also the butt-hurt steam user whining about Epic exclusivity are amusing considering how many games on the Steam store are exclusive to Steam only."
399,Druganov,"Aug 14, 2020",3,"If a single-player game makes me ragequit, then it's a **** game. I played the 1.007 version, a year after it was released on PC, i haven't encountered any major game-breaking bugs or frame-rate issues. but the game itself just sucks. Four things that completely annoyed the hell out of me: - Horrible sound/npc design. I was hoping that my companions would shoot themselves in the mouth so they could finally shut up talking. and in overall, the game sounds like a convuluted mess. - Irritating cutscenes, especially in the beginning of the game, completely put my mind out of the game because you're not in control for half of the time. - Wrong sense of helplessness, i had no idea what i should do, or where i should go to, especially early in the game, and had to reload a lot of times after getting shot to hell (and the ludicrous one-slot save system doesn't help) - After i melee-attacked a humanimal it went down and it got back up, i melee-attacked it again, and it got back up. repeated that FOR 80 TIMES until i gave up and i was killed by it. I just couldn't help myself from bursting out in laughter and disbelief and almost destroying my keyboard by smashing ALT+F4 I wonder how this game ever passed any playtest and Q&A department, my guess is that those people are too dumb to tie their own shoelaces."
400,Aeryx,"Sep 19, 2020",6,"The GOOD:- Metro Exodus has very good graphics. You should play this game in Windows 10. In Windows 7, it still works great, but it doesn't have ray tracing.- I like the backpack system. But the crafting system is abused and poorly executed.- Ranger mode is the way it is meant to be played, but this has bad and unexpected setbacks.- The firearm sounds have improved.- Available in GOG, which is great, but still came 1 year after EPIC store exclusivity. The BAD:- The game has become a semi-open world adventure compared to the claustrophobic tunnels of previous games. And sadly, it has been executed poorly. It has a very predictable story and very bad writing. The developers were very good at FPS games, but not with RPG-style open world games and it shows very clearly.- EPIC exclusivity on the first year of release is BAD for everyone as it divides the fan base.- The game is full of ridiculous fetch quests and other stupid tasks with Artyom being a ""silent protagonist"". Artyom talks on loading screens but not during the actual game. WTF?! This makes the game VERY awkward as strangers you meet for the first time will very quickly tell you their WHOLE life story and regrets without your character saying anything or even introducing himself. Then after that massive expo dump, the characters you meet will quickly give you quests. I still can't believe that a kid asked me to get his teddy bear or a woman asked me to get a picture of her mother. Getting those things made me fight so many monsters and people. If someone asked me to kill so many to get their teddy bear in real life, I would shoot them right away.- The Ranger mode is very poorly executed for people who played it for the first time in ranger because the game removed all UI, even menus to select grenades or operate the radio while in the Aurora. It was very stupid having to explore buttons just to stand up from the radio table because the UI was invisible.- The crafting system was abused to the point of laziness. ALL merchants have been removed from the game which is very immersion breaking. Also Artyom mostly gets crafting materials. It's very wrong to see huge links of live ammunition and crafting materials in a table and when you hit ""E"" Artyom ignores the ammo and just gets the crafting materials. The game lets you craft everything except guns. This was clearly done as a LAZY alternative to come up with a currency and merchant stores. It was very bad and feels lazy. How can the world be short of anything when anybody can just craft ammo from commonly available materials?- The guns become dirty overtime, but they become dirty VERY quickly. It's like you cover them in mud after a few uses or if you fall in a swamp of water. That's now how this works in real life.- The characters are very POORLY WRITTEN. Everybody is just there to give you quests. There are so many Spartans but they all just guard the train with Artyom having to do EVERYTHING. This feels very stupid. Anna calls you ""My Love"" all the time. This feels so unlike her and very cheesy. You can tell she is going to die because the game tries so hard to force you to have an emotional connection with her. It is so unnatural.- The gun customization is VERY lazy and allows you to turn your assault rifle into a sniper rifle or submachinegun in just a few seconds. This is ridiculous and not how it works in real life. You need a gunsmith for this and proper tools and this takes lots of effort and time. You can't just do it with a backpack. It's very lazy, as this was just done to eliminate gun merchants.- There are no merchants in the game and no currency. Gone are the signature Military Grade Rounds. So much for post-apocalyptic immersion. This is a theme park dressed like Metro!- The enemies are very predictable one-dimensional Mad Max-style despots. And the game added ZOMBIES (called humanimals). Metro doesn't need zombies, but let's add lazy cliches and uncreative enemies for the walking dead fans, complete with crossbow.- The whole story is very stupid. You can tell they ran out of book material. After the dark ones, they just make all kinds of bad decisions on where to go on the train. Funny thing here is, if they want a peaceful place, there are so many nice spots you pass by while travelling, but everyone just ignores it. They have to pick a place heavily infested by bandits, radiation and monsters. What were they thinking?! This writing is very unMetro-like.- If you played the Metro 2033 and Last Light, you will definitely feel the loss of quality with this game. It's just a cheap attempt to turn Metro into a Borderlands or Stalker clone."
401,Khornez,"Oct  7, 2020",4,"The game feels like a downgrade in fun for an upgrade in graphics. It's slow and clunky, extremely so, where the character moves like its waddling through jelly. The fact that so many actions are ""press [E] to"" just makes it a lot more boring. Quite often i see an area i wanna go into and gotta slow down for the prompt, press the key, slowly crawl to the other side just to pick two components and have to repeat the same. But it gets worse when it comes to more cinematic-y stuff. Walking by the coast? sudden mutant jumps out and we are now in cinematic quick time event spam [E]. Im on a boat and suddenly notice my input does nothing? here comes the monster smash. There are so many instances of the game playing itself and at times if you are ""lucky"" you get to repeatedly push a key. On the other hand, where it'd be nice to have your character locked is in dialogues but nope, they decided to let you free so you have the option to walk away but basically cant (if you want to learn anything that is) but the trick? that often other people also talk to you or on the side so you cannot get what they are saying (and if you wanted to play it in russian with subtitles, say goodbye to subtitles working in any way, at times they even break when there's only one person talking...). The parts when you finally get to play in between small quick time events or large first person (at times slow and clunky) cinematics, dont feel too compelling either. If you want stealth there are way better options including the previous two games (even if they had their issues, still better) because here there is SO much light and cover means **** so even if you only peek a little, an enemy multiple meters away will be alerted in an instant. If you like action on the other hand, i've ran into a couple invisible walls where the enemy wouldnt flinch but he could shoot back, tho they seem to be able to shrug off shots from a rifle somewhat easily, and of course they can shoot for hours but once you kill them and loot them, they'll have like 6 or 7 bullets. I've found myself leaving an encounter with less bullets and medkits than i started it with. Story wise? so far it's rather meh and i am struggling to feel compelled to continue. Anna's entire character is being overly attached and constantly being ""oh my love!!!"". Her dad is just grumpy for the sake of grumpy and the rest of the initial cast is generic bravado goofball soldier going ""har har boobs"". The atmosphere as far as i've seen is not that great either, i wonder why keep calling it Metro. This feels more like a less compelling version of Stalker. Seems like they wanted to add random elements from the Ubisoft sandbox formula, poorly, while keeping some of the crappiest parts of the Metro system (inventory and UI, and seriously don't start with the ""muh realism"" because then we have truckloads of prompts with floating [E] icons and other **** and lets not talk about the 'oh, your dogtag stopped the bullet!' cringy as hell moment)."

An 8 year might be proud to write such a  story but i guess they had at least one adult involved and even if you are on drugs or vodka all the time i cannot believe how bad this was done. I begin to think, thanks for Artjom not talking because anything he could say would probably annoy me some more.-2Monster respawn is to much too quick and similar believable as the dialogues.-1A hidden moral system where you are not allowed to shoot anyone shooting at you.-1Had to do a chapter restart 3 times because of the same game breaking and well known bug and finally uninstalled this piece of ****-5"
403,leMMingSlayeR,"Mar 13, 2019",6,"As a longtime fan of the Metro games, I have to say that this was my least favorite entry in the series.  The story is good, and as a final game it wraps up the trilogy well.  The graphics are mostly very nice, but oddly there are some areas and/or textures that are out of place and very muddy-looking or low-res when compared with the rest of the game.  It seems fairly well optimized as my Ryzen 7 and GTX 1070 average over 100FPS at a mix of high and medium settings @ 1080p.  My main issue with this game is the bugs.  In the course of playing this game I was subjected to countless bugs, glitches, freezes and crashes.  From assets floating in mid air to creatures forgetting to be hostile to you and shuffling around in circles en masse while you walk into them.  Allies clip right through walls and my player has gotten physically stuck in obstacles in the map on several occasions.  I have had numerous crashes, and was even rewarded for finishing the game by a crash to desktop immediately at the end of the credits.  It feels to me that this game was rushed to market as it just doesn't have the smoothness or polish of a finished game.  This is only made worse by the reputation of the developers based on the previous two games.  All the bugs (I finished the game in two weeks and I did not have a single bug-free or glitch-free session) really just break the immersion and drag me out of the world of the Metro.  It left a bittersweet taste in my mouth as I really wanted to love this game but just couldn't get past the technical issues. 6/10"

412,oiledmidget,"Mar 15, 2020",2,"edit: I've decided to play the whole thing again on hardcore ranger difficulty level (first playthrough was on normal) just to see if I am missing something. The gameplay is not very different, but it made me revise my score down significantly. The reason: this games punishes you severely for playing it ANY OTHER WAY than SJW developers intended, by  killing off your NPC teammates and ultimately you, the protagonist. Enough said, this garbage is now uninstalled and I doubt very much that I will buy another game from this studio. I am kinda glad that this game released on epic crap store first. Bought it on steam for $30 and even that is too much for this one, I think the fair value would be about $15.But anyway. Lets talk about the good first.Visuals: the game looks great and runs well. I don't have an RTX card, just an old 1080TI at 1440p resolution and everything looked drop dead gorgeous, with exception of desert map where it started to chug quite a bit. Weapons looked great and so did characters. Some of character animations were a bit dicey though.Setting: I really liked the idea of a train as a moving, upgradeable home base. That was pretty dope, really hoping someone will take that idea to the next level, with a better game.The second half of the very last map, Novosibirsk, was just damn awesome. Gave me massive Stalker flashbacks and I loved it. Now on to the parts that were bleh.Sound: nothing special, really.  Solid middle.Map design: uninspiring at best. There were some really pretty parts but the gameplay  was kinda tepid. Like previous Metro games, the maps are extremely linear, even the more open ones.Enemy and friendly AI: absolutely rudimentary and generally a detriment to the game.Crafting and inventory management: I was not put off by it but didn't enjoy it all that much either. Now the parts that sucked some really smelly Ukrainian ass:Plot/story: I thought this was just the worst. There are no redeeming qualities here, it's just garbage throughout -  especially because so much potential (the ""Great Train Adventure"" premise) had been squandered by a nonsensical plot. You can't built anything decent on a rotten foundation, so all the good elements of this title fall flat because of the extra-stupid story.Voiceover: easily the worst part of the game. With VERY FEW exceptions, voice acting was beyond bad, this is just high-school theater level of bad. And there's A LOT of talking in this title. Conclusion: worth picking up for $15-20, but don't expect the level of quality of previous Metro games. All good things eventually come to end, and this is the end of of Metro franchise; I am extremely skeptical that it can be salvaged after this uninspired turd.The anti-consumer decision to release exclusively on Epic also affected my rating."
413,UniqX,"Feb 27, 2019",10,"Не могу судить игру в рамках серии игр метро, но как самостоятельная игра мне она сильно зашла. Хорошая атмосфера, неплохая оптимизация, интересные диалоги. Разве что немой Артём бесил когда ему вроде бы прямой вопрос задают а он молчит."
414,KOTOCTPOphy,"Mar 13, 2019",9,"The game is awesome in all way-around, but sound. Sound sucks at most. And the reason is that developers were too greedy to put some effort in producing new samples and QA that afterwards. Some of sound presets were taken from previous parts. Voices are unsynced and have huge pauses in between characters talk. The same method used in old-fashioned games, but this does not fit in Exdodus. At least it should not.Footsteps are bugging most. How QA team (if any) accepted that? You can hear a dozen steps just by pushing W for a second. it's like a character has 10 feet, not less."

416,FerlockV,"Mar 11, 2019",9,"Metro Exodus is an amazing game. Like the rest of the franchise it shines for the atmosphere and the feeling of “density” in the air thanks to particles and light effects but this time developers have created a beautiful open world for us to enjoy also. The graphics in this game are the best to the date there is no video game in the history of videogames that gets even close to the visual quality of this Metro, of course this will be more noticeable in a high end PC at higher resolutions and settings but still if you have a mid-range PC the game will blow you away in this aspect.As many people have said the AI feels week and you will encounter some bugs (non critical ones) during the adventure so be ready for that but for the rest this game is a masterpiece.Be sure to take your time and enjoy all the corners and secrets that this game has to offer."

I ran into several very frustrating glitches. The cut scenes are often very slow and drawn out. Sometimes you need to follow somebody who also moves extremely slowly. There was one part where the guy kept telling me to hurry up, but I was constantly waiting for him. Some parts of the game are very difficult to figure out, not in a fun way. It seems to go back and forth between being too easy and too hard. I didn't find the story all that interesting. I give it a 6.5. I wasn't sad when the game was over. I actually felt kind of relieved and uninstalled it right away."

For this day I remember place in metro where was even a strip club or in other time place where people was in quarantine dying. Here you won;t even see a town- soldiers. What can I say here I don't feel like even be around soldiers. In Metro 2033 on D6 I remember how I was in mission and how proper soldiers talk and act. I felt like in team, Here I can;t say I feel like in team because I allways go alone !- Gameplay. I hate when game force me to play on one way.

425,DroneSky,"Apr  8, 2019",8,"Metro EXODUS. Как много это для меня значило, ведь серия игр метро моя любимая серия игр. Но после релиза я столкнулся с несколькими проблемами из-за которых игре можно поставить 5 баллов. Кто то скажет,-""Эй, но ты поставил 8 баллов!"", да, это так, но об этом в конце. Начну разбор игры с одного из самых главных составляющих игры: графика. В целом графон тянет на 6-7 баллов из-за ужасной оптимизации (если она вообще есть) и в целом далеко не самой плохой картинки, даже не на максимальных настройках. Теперь плавно переходим к ещё одной основной части этой игры: сюжет. Он тут есть и, в целом, тянет не на 10 а на восемь баллов только из-за некоторых костылей, вроде переговоров людоеда из Ямантау и Мельника, в котором голос первого звучит не как у регулярного военного а как у маньяка, и ведь всем на это наплевать. Третье: озвучка и анимации. Озвучка вышла на редкость хорошей, но вот анимации ужасные, а ГГ и вовсе молчит. Слова не поподают в губы а жестикуляция как у итальянца под адреналином. Где то 4 из 10 только за неплохую озвучку. Четвёртое: атмосфера. Многим не понравился открытый мир, об этом дальше, но мне понравился выход из тёмных пещер в ужасающие пустоши России 9 из 10. А теперь геймплей. В новой части метро попытались сделать открытый мир и выйти на поверхность, что получилось довольно хорошо, но, к сожалению, локации получились хоть и большими, но пустыми, а третья локация стала вообще одним небольшим коридором, хотя на неё я возлагал большие надежды 5 из 10. Ну а вот и заключение. Игра получилась средней, особенно учитывая то, что она продавалась за фулл прайс 2к рублей за обычное, или 3к за золотое издание. 4a games, надо соответствовать ценнику, ведь в релиз я бы не отдал за данную игру и 1.5к рублей. А теперь вот ответ, почему я поставил иге 8 а не 5 баллов? Ребята из 4a games одни из малочисленных разработчиков игр в странах СНГ и их проект стал одним из самых лучших выпущенных на Руси. Поэтому я даю вам несколько баллов авансом, потому что верю, что ваши проекты могут быть гораздо лучше и рассчитываю на это. Ну вот и кончился мой обзор, целую щёчки, жму сосочки, удачи в игропроме, 4a games!"

Graphics are terrible, the textures itself are garbage in its pure form. Dying light, the game by some polish studio, had better textures! And it was in 2015!!! The story is awful as well, all the characters are blend, poorly scripted. And the last thing is optimization - the worst look/performance game I've ever played. Game looks normal for `2017 year or so, but it performs terrible, not only the FPS is low for my GTX 1080 but stutters time to time here and there killing all the process of enjoying the game.

437,Koolstr,"Dec  6, 2020",4,"The absolutely stunning visuals & memorable vistas don't save this game from its terrible story, awful mechanics, and downright stupid design decisions. I'm a big fan of the first two games in the series, but this entry is simply subpar on all accounts besides graphics. By far, the most glaring flaw and dumb mistake was their decision to keep Artyom a silent protagonist, when he interacts and holds direct conversations with literally dozens of people throughout the campaign. This becomes a glaring problem when they say things that warrant a direct response from him, or when they explicitly ask him something and expect a response. And yet, Artyom already voices every chapter synopses. There is so much that goes on that would have benefited from having him speak in-game, it would have lent many events much more emotional heft and necessary plausibility. The graphics in this game are insane, I'll admit it, though it is just about the only great thing about the game. All the settings, locales, environments, and vistas look drop-dead gorgeous 90% of the time, and I couldn't help but take countless screenshots during my playthrough. The designers deserve some serious credit for creating a world with this much graphical fidelity. That being said, the environments are so completely devoid of interesting things or anything interactive for that matter, that it all comes across as barely worth exploring. That drive for exploration is further curtailed by the fact that there are next to no discoverables or hidden items spread throughout these maps. I've explored practically every nook and cranny, and have barely ever received any award for doing so, let alone an actual substantial reward. This game's map comes across as the most dead, empty, bland, and un-engaging map I've ever played in since the original Red Dead Redemption. The game is super buggy, in everything from its cut-off or off-cue audio elements (consecutive character dialogue often completely overlaps, for example), to the wonky, unnatural, & downright terrible mechanics of the sprint ability. Enemies don't spawn or move right, characters float, bullets don't register, the camera pops up & stays that way when opening the map while in the car, and so much more. Stealth is practically impossible to fully play in. The gunplay is ok, the menu system is neat enough, the crafting mechanics are solid, and the gun customization is just thorough enough to be satisfactory yet not overwhelming. Aiming with a controller thumbstick is atrocious, no matter the sensitivty preset you use. Whoever developed these controls and thought they were ok messed up big time. It handles terribly. There are some great jump scares, and some solid creepy or survival horror moments, with a particularly creepy level at the very end of the game. The last level of the game is its best and was actually pretty great (and has a beautiful ending track), and probably not coincidentally is the one that sticks closest to the gameplay style & setting of the games before it. The other levels all had very promising starting segments, where the possibilities open up in beautiful ways, but then end up totally squandered with some terrible mechanics and storytelling. The loading times in this game are atrocious, some of the worst I've ever witnessed in a game. To start with, there is an unskippable 3-minute intro sequence until you can even load into the game each time you start it up, which is unbearable enough. But then levels take minutes to load as well! The story is extremely flawed, with tons of plot holes, bad writing, weak plotting, and lack of emotional impact. Some of the post-apocalyptic scenarios and plot points were ripped straight from The Walking Dead, yet handled far less meaningfully, gracefully, impactfully, or interestingly than they were there. Many of the game's scenarios are taken straight from other existing sources, including the setup of all the present factions. The characters are all unique, yet somehow remain uninteresting and unengaging. Many conversations come across as straight-up awkward or unnatural, and all character faces remain relatively expressionless at all times. The voice acting is mostly atrocious, & at its best barely acceptable. There is so much blatant exposition and excessive dialogue. Worst of all, you have to sit through many crazy deliveries of boring & uninteresting exposition - sometimes 10 minutes long each, and sometimes consecutively! This is not how to tell a story. Furthermore, some of the story threads lead nowhere, don't get addressed or were for naught, and the morality system is badly implemented & utilized. In summary, this is an awful game but an incredible walking simulator. I suggest either just watching a cutscene compilation on YouTube, or playing through the game on easy without bothering with exploration or crafting. With some competent storywriters, scripting, and voice acting, it might have even been decent."

Но в целом игра красивая и интересная. Сейчас мало хороших AAA игр по пост апокалипсису и тот факт что вы изменили концепт от линейного к таком странному но опен ворлду, это круто. Это здорово. Мне  не скучно играть в эту игру. И даже если бы я не предзаказал ее в steam я бы не отказался от покупки на другой площадке. Мне важна игра и франшиза. Спасибо! Делайте больше таких проектов!"

449,seannybgoode,"Feb 18, 2019",9,"While the game isn't a true open-world; the designers seem to fall back on linear progression through the story for a large portion of it, the open world components were really well done. It truly feels like you're wading knee deep through a nuclear holocaust. For the environment, and the story, well done. This isn't an American style story of the hero versus evil, it's more of a story of communities surviving against nature, and sometimes eating each-other alive in the process. It truly follows the Russian tradition of storytelling, and for that reason, it really brings something fresh to the game industry. The open world components, while limited, were well flushed out and worked well. It will be interesting to see where the metro series goes from here, and hopefully we can  look forward to them expanding on the open world tech they've developed, and moving away from the linear progression they seem to fall back on."

Animations are dated, the voicing is not bad per-say, but I just can't get behind it. The gameplay is very dull and simply put, boring. On console, I would imagine this to be pretty fun!

While i wasnt the biggest fan of the two previous games this one blew me away with stunning graphics and a tense atmosphere. After finally leaving the tunnels you embark on a journey aboard the Aurora looking for a new home to settle down in, somewhere in post nuclear Russia. The open levels give you multiple ways to approach your objectives, a karma system affects certain parts of the story and a lot of dialog lets you learn more about the side characters. Graphics are absolutely stunning, every level looks completely different from the other with great particle and weather effects. Negative points for me were the mute main character, some frame drops without changing an option in the ini file and overlapping dialoge that made it sometimes hard to follow what was being said. The voice acting sometimes comes across as wooden, albeit understandable from a russian game."

Жаль что такой отличной игре занижают оценки только из за того что она продается в другом магазине, этого я категорически  не понимаю.

470,PortWeinShow,"Feb 21, 2019",0,"Очень люблю серию Metro, полюбил её ещё с книги ""Метро 2033"", прошёл все игры, выходившие по ней ранее, читал даже некоторые книги из ""Вселенной Метро"". И с E3-2018 ждал с нетерпением новой игры. Сказать что я разочарован - ничего не сказать. Нет, я не из тех пекавоенов, которые ополчились на Deep Silver из-за отмены продаж в Стиме - мне всё равно в каком магазине они её продают, более того - я взял игру по предзаказу и всё равно её получил в свою библиотеку. Тут дело в реально наплевательском отношении разработчиков к своей работе. А именно - наих*ёвейшая оптимизация за всю историю игростроя. Даже Ubisoft так не лажали. Машина у меня вполне мощная - более чем соответствует минимальным требованиям: процессор Core I7-4770, видеокарта GTX-1050ti с 4 гигами, операивной памяти гигов 16. Тот же новенький Resident Evil 2 Remake тянул на высоких настройках без тормозов. А что тут? А тут мы видим вылеты ещё на вступительном ролике! Если у вас каким-то чудом не вылетела игра здесь - то она точно вылетит потом - на чёрном экране после этого же ролика! А при попытке запустить игру после этого - вам предложат запустить в сейф-моде. И что же выходит потом? Лютейшее мыло, в котором ничего нельзя разглядеть! Даже перенастройка графике не поможет. И если вы один раз запустили игру в сейф-моде - поздравляю! Теперь вы его уже никак не отключите, даже переустановка не поможет! В-общем нервом и времени я потратил достаточно, теперь give me back my money, a*holes, и к новым играм про Метро уже точно никогда не прикоснусь. Поверить только - 3000 рублей - и одни разочарования."
471,itmoo,"Feb 17, 2019",6,"For me this game was barely a 6/10.  The big issues with the game - The voice acting is bad, really bad, its like they just grabbed some random people off the street and said, ""hey read this"".  There is zero buy in with the characters due to the lack of emotion and constant monotone delivery acted by people whom should never voice act in a game ever again. This game has worst sound design I have encountered ever in a game.  You can move half a foot and all of a sudden the gale force winds go silent, step back and the gale winds return.  You can be 3 rooms away from a character and hear them better than the character trying to brief you on the next mission.  The A.I can hear to an exact pinpoint location, where your silent arrow came from, but trying to locate the enemy by sound is impossible.  You think someone is 5 feet behind you, nope they are in fact 3 buildings away and in front. I am running an RTX card and at times this game looks bad, the textures are rough, the water doesn't look close to being water from distance and the general look of characters could have been from a game 10 years ago, The gameplay is old - Cliche after cliche scripted events, when you think something might happen, 100% of the time it does and the surprises along the way are so 1990's it makes the entire immersive experience feel rushed and lacking any innovation.  The world itself is not engaging or interesting. I felt zero challenge when playing this game on hardcore.  The game doesn't reward what limited exploring it has, you can just hit the main mission areas in each of the small handful of unique areas, of which I found none to be anywhere near as interesting as the original setting in Moscow. A.I - The horrendous A.I this game has, needs to be experienced to be believed, in fact i can't recall any other FPS game in the last 20 years with a worse A.I. BTW, it is the worst Metro game of the series, it has lost its charm, challenge and engaging story."

473,Chaython,"Feb 24, 2019",6,"The story was great, ending will make you cry. The graphics are amazing thanks to RTX; though there's lots of textures etc that are very low quality. There are so many issues with the game...Bad:Animations are choppy; when people are too close sometimes you shoot right through them; lots of bars you can't shoot through. Sometimes the knockout prompt doesn't appear.Dialogue is often overlapping; hard to focus on some of the stories.AI sees me as soon as I enter an area; crouched or not;  flashlight or not.You have to hold E constantly; everything has a 1 second delay where you have to hold E... A vent looks like you can crouch through, well guess what you have to old E to go through you can't just crouch; very un-intuitive and clunky.Flashlights are visible through walls [RTX On] ; the game is too dark with no gamma slider? FOV is very low, and motion blur is forced. Causing dizziness / motion sickness and claustrophobia.The FOV is very low, claustrophobic; the games blood effects don't stretch to screen and there are many issues with a higher FOV; but they should know by now that people demand 60-90FOV; lower will make you literally dizzy/sick.There's lots of little stuff you get stuck on.There's no borders on the map, so you can go to the edge and jump off.You're unable to pickup other people's gas masks; rather you have tape all over your screenFire looks like a loq sprite, bad.Rag-dolls fly around...Monsters attacks are very bugy.Lots of areas you can just run to the door and skip the combat even if it is an action area."

481,LuciferCena,"Feb 22, 2019",8,"Мне очень понравилась эта игра. Давайте я коротко и ясно объясню что в ней плохого, а что хорошего. Минусы:-Графика явно не 2019 год-Баги, которых просто вагон и маленькая тележка-Тупой ИИ, как в Last Light Плюсы:-Персонажи живые и яркие (Я об этом расскажу в конце)-Стрельба стала лучше-Атмосфера-Геймплей преобразился-Сюжет хороший Персонажи. Господи, как же я обожаю после заданий вернутся к авроре и слушать сторонние диалоги. Их шутки, смотреть, как экипаж взаимодействует друг с другом, как на одном поезде, мчащимся через  всю необъятную, сближаются члены экипажа. Когда женились Степан с Катей, я аж разрыдался. Я сидел и от счастья выступали слёзы. Настолько ты привязываешься к персонажам, вот, бл**ь настолько. Персонажи не ходящие карикатуры, а полноценные и живые люди. Отдельно хочу отметить Аню. Это самый лучший женский персонаж 2019 года. Заботливая, умная, любящая и хорошая жена. Когда возвращаюсь с очередного задания обязательно нахожу её и слушаю её монологи. Когда едем с ней в поезде от одной локации к другой, то стараюсь провести с ней как можно больше времени. Почему? Да потому что слушать её монолог про ситуацию, про будущее - очень интересно. Не хочется от неё отходить ни на шаг. Она по настоящему любит его и это чувствуется даже с другой стороны монитора. У Артёма даже появилась возможность читать свой дневник в том же поезде, где есть сводки обо всех членах экипажа, оружии, местах и монстрах. Я ставлю 8/10. Не слушайте идиотов, ставящих 0 и 1. Тут два варианта. 1 - у них слабое ведро и игра не пошла. 2 - игра теперь в Epic Store и нельзя сделать карточки.На всякий случай.Хар - ки моего ПК:-GTX 1050TI-IntelCore I3 8100-8Gb DDR4Играется комфортно, плюс, сегодня вышел патч 1.0.0.1 для Steam или 1.0.1.1 для ES"

483,Gefest01rus,"Feb 23, 2019",10,"Начал проходить игру начитавшись кучи отзывов и, из-за этого отношение к игре у меня было довольно предвзятое. Разумеется, начну с камня преткновения- epic store. Это было ошибка издателя, но это никак не должно портить мнение об игре. Сначала обозначу ряд общих претензий к игре:1) Косые анимации. На моем пути прохождения я нашел только единственный косяк - тень героя (ходит болванчик, руки по швам). В остальном - персонажи действительно живые, нет кучи стандартных анимаций, впиханных во все диалоги, как в том же mass effect например.2) Оптимизация. Тут конечно кошмар. На моей системе 8700k,16gb ram 3000mgz 1050ti до пустыни на высоких 60-70 кадров, но потом просто ужас, а в тайге вообще пришлось снизить до низких. Настройки видео очень топорны и имеют малый диапазон настройки, не дают подогнать качество под свою систему (средние тени и высокие текстуры например).3) Графика. Не знаю почему она не понравилась многим, но даже на высоких игра очень приятна глазу мельчайшими деталями. На ультрах так вообще можно кайфовать.4) Геймплей. Мне нравится как переделали движок. Есть продвижение, в сравнении с предыдущими частями. Стрельба довольно приятна, персонаж не управляется как мешок, хотя системы выглядывания из укрытий очень не хватало, при прыжках создавалось впечатление, будто гравитация как на луне, а утычки персонажа в невидимые стены или ступеньки порой просто выводили из себя.5) Сюжет. 10 из 10. Нельзя сказать что он супер оригинален, но игра берет потрясающе прописанными мелочами, персонажами, диалогами. Поездки на авроре, в промежутке между миссиями становятся приятным расслаблением после беготни по полуоткрытым локациям с гриндом ресурсов. В диалоги наконец ввели взаимодействие гг с персонажами, но его немота атмосферу портила.Подытожив, скажу, что игра потрясла меня. Давно от проектов за последние несколько минувших нескольких лет я не получал такой круговорот эмоций и приятное послевкусие после прохождения. Это была отличная история и игра заслуживает минимум 8.5 рейтинга. Однако это оценка исключительно самого продукта, а не отношения издателя к своей аудитории: все тот же epic-store, завышенные требования к железу, причем, на мой взгляд, искусственно, и цена. Отдать 4 тыс.руб за игру могут далеко не все. С нынешней ценой на железо и требованиями игры цена слишком высока"

Только влияние на концовку.Относительно скучный сюжет.Красивый графон.Стрельба +- хороша.Стелс полная фигня. Почти все точки и миссии проходил ""На пролом"".Те самые ""Различные варианты концовок"" мне кажутся полным бредом т.к. зависят они от того убивал ли некоторых персонажей (иногда бывает выбор) и выполнял ли ты побочки. Это просто тупо. Я думал там будут разветвления сюжета, как в том же LiS, где твое первое действие отражается на последующих и предеться выбирать с умом. Но нет. Такого нет.Крайне мало геймплея. Прошел игру полностью, выполняя все побочки, читая все записки и обыскивая каждый уголок, за два с половиной дня.Я бы дал этой игре награду: ""Разочарование года""."
493,Valen0k,"Feb 17, 2019",10,"Игра вышла не просто хорошей, а отличной. Баги/лаги/глюки-это все нормально для игры, которая только вышла, а засирать РАЗРАБОТЧИКОВ(т.е. игру) за то, что ИЗДАТЕЛЬ решил резко  перенести игру на другой магазин-это не просто глупо, это уже доводит до абсурда.Геймплей претерпел изменения в лучшую сторону, появилось больше механик и функционала; графика-стала сильно лучше, а те кто говорят что анимации из 2008, то они ошибаются, они может и похожи на 2008, но отличаются довольно сильно, так при этом их стало в разы больше.В общем я не понимаю большую часть негативных обзоров, все проблемы будут решены патчами, тем более, что проблем не так и много(хотя у меня, по части вылетов, ошибок и т.д., вообще ничего нет)."
494,torvo,"Feb 22, 2019",10,Great game! Enjoying it a lot! The graphics are very good. Story is engaging and pulls you in.
495,RavenZyT,"Feb 22, 2019",9,"The video-game is very I¡inmersive, maybe there's few problems i've been trough as the ambient audio problem while talking with main characters. But it still being a good game. The story is a 10/10 it continues the line of the other games and it keeps you looking at the screen on every moment you're playing the game, i like the fact that they added a half-open world because it encourages you to go and explore the map. But not all is good about the game. Many problems as the mentioned before of the audio, and few game bugs but in my opinion the game for me is too short even doing side quests i hope that when the season pass content is released the game will have more hours to play in this amazing world of metro."
496,Kle1n,"Feb 21, 2019",9,"Игра хорошая, атмосфера и эмоциональная составляющая не подкачали. Хорошая идея сделать локации в поезде. Крафт не прекрасен но тоже хорошая часть игры. Искусственный интеллект плохой. Я стою в метре от врага, он меня не видит. Но в общем игра хороша. Жаль, не будет продолжения. Я бы поиграл и поддержал бы отечественных разработчиков."
497,Denvormine,"Feb 21, 2019",9,"Ну чтож, пройдемся сразу по минусам. Обосрались со стимом, обосрались с анимациями, обосрались с балансом сложностей, обосрались с графикой, обосрались с багами, обосрались с оптимизацией. Но если на все это закрыть глаза, то перед нами предстает восхитительная игра с неповторимой атмосферой, захватывающим сюжетом, персонажами, западающими в душу, неплохой системой кастомизации и просто ностальгическим дизайном. Я не пожалел отданных за нее денег, это была первая игра, которую я купил, а не спиратил. Ставлю 9 только из-за неадекватов, которые ставят 0 за переход из стима в эпик геймс, а так игра на 7 с учетом недостатков."
498,DKM,"Feb 22, 2019",9,The New Game of the Metro series shows how good modern games can look  like. The Story is good and refreshing in the metro series. It still can be scary at times but maybe not as much as the other metro games. There are some bugs but I only needed one reload. The game is one of the best of its kind.
499,BarelyLewd,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Amazing game, one of the best games i have played in years, between the story, the graphics, the game play, and the characters I can see this game being game of the year, what an amazing way to end one of the greatest series of games of all time, thank you so much for the experience I wont over forget, an easy 10/10."
500,justaeger,"Feb 23, 2019",9,"4А Games, вы сделали потрясающую игру!!! Очень жаль, что пекари занизили оценку из-за того, что игра не вышла в стим, но они ничего не стоят!Ставлю 910, тк в середине игра жестко проседает (скучно играется, это в пустыне), но а концовка просто поразила, тяжелая,  я немного слезу пустил. Но считаю, что концовку (хорошую) можно было раскрыть получше.Следующую часть Metro наверное ожидать не надо, тк в принципе уже все рассказано, но можно сделать сюжет где Артем возвращается в Метро и зовет всех наверх создавать колонию.В общем, спасибо за игру! Обязательно перепройду!"
501,N1GHTM4RE_0,"Feb 24, 2019",9,"Metro Exodus is a gorgeous game that gives has a very in-depth story line that is given in a non-linear way. Players experience the open worlds in many different ways, relying on skill, and the ability to remember to always change the filter on your mask. The weapon customization is very in-depth and the game as a whole is very atmospheric. While the publishers decided to launch the game on Epic Games Launcher exclusively for the first year, that doesn't mean the game itself is bad. Overall, if you're into story games, and love shooting bad guys, you'll love this game."
502,lilkillpappy,"Feb 16, 2019",10,"so far the best game of 2019. Great world design, beautiful graphics that are packed full of detail. The game runs great and looks great, with or without ray tracing turned on. The dialogue is translated from Russian so it isn't perfect but I found it quirky and fun and it gave a lot of character to all the npcs. The story is compelling and nuanced, the detail oriented, survivor oriented game-play and mechanics give the game a good amount of depth and constantly keep you engaged, entertained and challenged. The atmosphere, as always, is thick and makes for great escapism into a very unique world. I find myself compelled to stay and explore every single inch of its meticulously crafted world, for no reason other than to see what these talented minds crafted. As for the Epic Store, I wasn't happy not being able to pre-load the game, but it downloaded very quickly and the $10 discount more than makes up for any inconvenience of having to use the Epic launcher. Overall, if more money can be given to the developers to continue making this quality of games, then it's worth it. Steam really needs to offer better rates and this new competition might motivate steam to improve. I have had very little bugs or issues with the Epic launcher or the game. Don't forget to install latest drivers, and play the game with keyboard and mouse if you want the best experience. Thank you 4A games for your passion and perseverance. I think your time and effort have come to create something truly special and I can't wait for your future games!"
503,Anastasyah,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"Офигенская игра. Но, боюсь по достоинству оценить ее смогут только СНГ-люди. Это – сталкер на максималках. Честно, предыдущие серии мне не зашли, показались унылыми, однообразными и скучными. Это же – просто некст левел."
504,TheBlackout00,"Feb 16, 2019",9,"This game is great, its the strongest overall game in all of the metro series. The gameplay is the best and while the first time out of the tunnels they do great with the open world. Its still feels story driven and a real journey. The pros are the gunplay, which is super tight and doesn't feel too bad. Just made what last light had but much better. the crafting system, I love it, its useful and a lot of what you need can be made anywhere in the field.  characters like Anna or Miller which in the last two games felt very forced or flat now they feel like real people, Especially Anna. The immersion is on pointand is great this game. Cons sometimes it feels unfocused but these are few and far between, the lack of actual ammo or filter/medkits. They really pushed for players to use the crafting system and on the difficulty of hardcore, it makes the resources for the crafting system scarce. Enemies had very little ammo and medkits not found. I wish there were more balanced in that sense. Lack of supernatural spooky stuff. Certain sections in Metro like going through the cursed tunnel with Khan are very memorable and this kind of stuff was lacking for most of the game. It's not until the last chapter did you see this kind of stuff which was disappointing. The Aurora has a lot of crew and not are all flushed out as I wished there were like Duke or Sam who felt wasted as characters. If you liked the other metro games then I would strongly recommend buying this one. I felt that it was a great entry to the series and loved it with all my heart. It took me about 30 hours to finished and even then felt that I didn't do all I could do."
505,Koolhandz,"Feb 16, 2019",9,After playing through Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light several times (including DLC) and completing Ranger Hardcore I was incredible hyped for Metro Exodus when I saw the reveal trailer. Fast forward to the release of the game where upon completion I could not have been more satisfied. The game lives up to the 2 wonderful games before it and surpasses expectations. Metro Exodus's graphics completely blew my mind as well as the attention to detail. The dirt collecting on your Klash after braving a sand storm and the many hidden encounters and weapon mods hidden all throughout the areas was very gratifying and immersing. The gun fights along with the responsiveness of the weapons made it feel grounded and serious while not feeling to slow. I also appreciated the various new mutants spread throughout the game which made it more fresh for us Metro veterans. My only complaint upon completion was the animations felt robotic and the coinciding voice lines often didn't line up quite right with their lips and the scenario at hand. Worth my nearly $90 for the gold edition and the pain of moving my pre-order from steam to Epic.
506,Tararator,"Feb 17, 2019",0,"You failed on the most basic level, which is that I could not even launch the game on my PC as there is a problem with the ""Metro Exodus Executable"" file which stops working - making me unable me to even launch the game. Therefore I cannot even review the content of this production as it won't even launch! The support team won't even respond either (at least in a way other than stupid automated responses).I am really sad and disappointed as I loved previous parts of the game and I love Glukhovsky's books. It's a real disgrace and shame, your game is the first one - I will demand a refund for."
507,StanDeny,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Fantastic graphics and atmosphere. You get to play in different large ""open-world"" maps in different climate.Pretty long but not too long to start getting boring. Pacing is just right.Gun fighting feels and sounds fantastic. Weapon modding is a nice plus.Great addition to the Metro series, stays true to the genre of single player, narrative driven, corridor shooter but with the spice of open world. Improves on previous metro games in all aspects."

517,WhiteOks,"Apr  7, 2019",8,"Игра мне понравилась , и определенно стоит Вашего внимания , НО она могла бы быть в разы круче если бы не нижеуказанные минусы. Я поклонник данной серии игр и с нетерпением ждал когда выйдет Metro:Exodus . Игра меня порадовала ! Геймплей , графика (не вау , но по сравнению со старыми частями неплохо), круто поставленные диалоги - все то несомненно плюсы игры , НО (ДАЛЬШЕ СПОЙЛЕРЫ) огорчил тот факт , что от идеи с Чёрными отказались - ибо в конце Metro:Last Light маленький Чёрный сказал , что они вернуться . Не знаю почему , но я прям расстроился ((( В обеих концовках о них ни слова . Что касается сюжет , в принципе было понятно в начале игры , что кто нибудь умрет , но Анна и Артём найдут место , где смогут жить , а не выживать . Я считаю было бы больше положительных отзывов (нытьё про перенос из Steam в EpicStore) , если бы вот так не перенесли игру . Пусть Создатели игры и получили сверху 30 лямов $ , но откровенно говоря магазин Epic - помойка еще та ... ни статистики прохождения , ни каких то достижений , ни каких либо еще популярных игр (вонючих Фортнайт не считается) НИЧЕГО !!! Напрягает и то , как разработчики поступили - никому ни сказав , вот так с бухты-барахты ,  взяли и перенесли игру . Игра мне понравилась , и определенно стоит Вашего внимания , НО она могла бы быть в разы круче если бы не вышеуказанные минусы .ENGI liked the game, and definitely worth your attention, but it could be at times steeper if not for the above cons. I'm a fan of this series of games and was looking forward to when will Metro:Exodus . The game pleased me ! Gameplay, graphics (not wow , but compared to the old parts of the good), cool set dialogues - all that is undoubtedly the pros of the game , but (FURTHER SPOILERS) upset by the fact that the idea of black abandoned - for at the end of Metro:Last Light little Black said that they return . Don't know why , but I was upset ((( In both endings the word about them . That concerns the plot , in principle was clear in the early game , that who any dies , but Anna and Artem will find place , where will be able to live, not survive . I think it would be more positive reviews (whining about the transfer from Steam to EpicStore) , if that's not moved the game . Let the Creators of the game and got on top of 30 Lam $, but frankly Epic store-garbage is still the one ... no statistics passage , nor any achievements , nor even any popular games (smelly Fortnight does not count) NOTHING !!! Annoying and how the developers did - anyone saying so out of the blue , he took and moved the game . I liked the game, and definitely worth your attention, but it could be at times steeper if not for the above cons ."
518,Waz294,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Мне очень понравилась эта игра, в первую очередь, как хороший рассказ и продолжение последней книги серии. Введение локаций, с линейными переходами, добавило нового, при этом так же сохранив атмосферу прошлых двух игр с помощью всяческих баз/подвалов и уровня ""Весна"".  Да, в сети много видео багов и прочего, но лично у меня 1 раз завис комп и всё. В остальном все хорошо. Только не смотрите на тень Артема :D"
519,Bashar_ua,"Feb 25, 2019",9,"The game is good.Needs some polishing, yes. Has a few bugs, glitches. Controls are somewhat clumsy.But the story is great. It's told in a cool way and you really want to reach the end of it. And it's very authentic. As a citizen of a former USSR country I can assure you - this is how a postapocalyptic scenery here would look like. Well... In certain places it does even now."
520,Fergussimo,"Feb 26, 2019",2,"This game is booooooring. The cut scenes are dull, badly acted and animated and are un-skippable. They go on forever. The action is dull and infrequent. There is no interaction with NPCs beyond the canned stuff. The open world is limited, like being dropped of on an island owned by a whatever cruise line you are on. The absence of a HUD is pretty interesting, but for some reason doesn't help immersion. Audio is weak. Needless to say, I'm disappointed."
521,Flashdriveking,"Mar  2, 2019",10,"This game is clearly the best in the trilogy, a great continuation of the game so far. Its difficult to notice this but you decisions in the chapter had a huge effect on how it ends which is an amazing edition. This is easily on of the best games releasing so far in 2019 and I hope people interested in the series are able to look past the salty fan base complaining about the epic exclusivity (I am one of them but it wont affect my review) I unfortunately cant say the same about the console versions but this is for PC specifically (some other reviewers definitely need a reminder of that)"
522,Jacsam,"Feb 22, 2019",9,The game is a ton of fun.  If you like single player story driven games then this is for you.  If you like the other metro games this should be on your short list.  It is different than the other metro games in that is more open worlds however there are many areas with close quarter combat.  I know that some reviews are bad because it is an epic exclusive but do not miss out on this game because of that.  If you were able to keep 88 percent of your profit versus 70 percent on steam you would make the same move.  I always judge my games based upon how I look forward to playing it.  This is one of those games.
523,Windaller,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Finished on PS4 Pro with a good ending. This game is just amazing! I am Ukrainian, and besides just been proud that my people did such a great project, I believe that it fair to say that in order to fully enjoy the game you have to be Eastern Slavic. You cant imagine how it feels when you go through the location and notice a huge amount of details that make you feel like this is real. Also, the story of the game may look simple to people who don't like to think much, but for me, this is just a representation of the ugly reality we live in. The government that brainwashes it, own citizens, creating a fictional enemy, while ""eating"" own people. This story is a lot deeper than just a road movie. And generally thank you to developers, and please give us more. Can't wait to see what will happen next."
524,Fedozzi,"Feb 24, 2019",10,"Вот чтобы не говорили про Логвинова, но этой игре я ставлю оценку точно так же как и он. Да у Метро есть много минусов (в основном технического характера), но как по мне они меркнут на фоне ее плюсов. Самое главное, что это первая игра за долгое время, где мне хотелось исследовать каждый угол (и захотелось написать ревью), я играл запоем до ночи и мне не надоедало (жду сюжетные дополнения). Особенно это заметно после всех этих одинаковых опен-ворлд дрочилен, в этой игре открытого мира ровно столько чтобы от него не начало тошнить. Если вы не питаете теплых чувств к Ленину, то берите не задумываясь, нет в игре русофобоии как тут многие кричат."
525,siaonss,"Apr  6, 2019",9,"The game is good and fun to play but there are some annoying things that i don't like , First : there are so many dialogues in between characters and it gets boring ,  Second : Face animations are bad  , Third : Stealth system in this game is not that good because of it's bad AI , if you stay in shadows nobody notices you even if he's standing in front of you but as soon as you enter the light everyone will see you."
526,Bravo1c,"Mar 22, 2019",10,"I am not writing this about a launcher, the game is fantastic, i have just finished it and boy oh boy is this money well spend in my opinion. The visuals are stunning and the level design is very solid, characters have meaning and all play their role in the story. The crafting system is simple and intuitive even for the more casual gamer, i would highly recommend this game. The only negative thing i have to say is the game is slightly buggy at the time of writing and i'm sure it be patched. Just what ever you do, do not save in any lifts."
527,Wildcardgsx,"Mar 10, 2019",4,"Honest Review4/10Some where between meh and ffs really. Going in to the game I really wanted it to be better then what I got. The major problem is Pacing the game tends to bore the living **** out of a player forcing you to sit through overly long dialog scenes and unskippable cut scenes in the first 20minutes of the game alone you'll play for only one or two minutes before being forced to sit through an extremely lengthy conversation that is not skippable. Again this goes right back to Pacing which occurs throughout the entirety of the game.  Though there are occasions such as the Admiral where a google search was required to find how to progress and it was not sit down and listen to this **** spouting madman to get a door to open but rather ignore him and cut the line to drop the ladder hidden behind him which No Indicator is provided your just supposed to know its there! This happens throughout the entirety of the game again not providing a visual indication of direction aside from the very last mission that gives atleast a sense of intended direction using a simple visual queue of power lines or ropes tide from one point to another.My next point is the amount of cliches in this game is just comedic as much as it is annoying and frustrating. The primary of which is upon entering Taiga where all of your gear that you spent hours collecting is stripped away from you leaving you feeling like you just got slapped in the face by devs.Speaking of collecting upgrades while it can feel rewarding for the most part others felt useless well most felt useless and others made you wander when do you use it without any kind of mission briefing that would indicate which upgrades would be preferred over others means your always going to take the same two extended filters and ammo harness. While the rest never got used at all. Instead of having these be upgrades that may all be equipped further extending all of your abilities holding more ammo, more throwables and more filters/health they are all separate and individual upgrades!Next the whole flash light and nightvision thing is well over done and not fine tuned enough. The night vision has the gamma and contrast of a world war 2 Gen1/Gen2 NOD and not something that would be found post 1998-2004 Again this suffers the most from the inability to use multiple upgrades simultaneously meaning that Night Vision usage drains the battery alot faster requiring frequent re-charging.  All the while using NV in any out side area means a blinding light coming from the skybox this might have been so bad if the Moon light source was not so close to the world space even having the NV-Amplifier upgrade shows little improvement resulting in a simple bypass at the cost of immersion by just cranking up the ingame brightness to full during the night time or any interior cell.This leads me to the next issue, In game settings or should I say the Lack Of In Game Settings such simple things light Contrast and Gamma but the worst culprit is the inability to turn on Windowed Mode A Long Standing Issue that has been in Every Single Metro Game! Least but surly not the last is save points where being limited to a single save condition is well I lack a better word the appalling.  A General sentiment that can be used multiple times through the entire game especially when you see unkillable npc's or droves of them that just keep spawning and/or respawning so quick that the feeling of simply turning around to try and run, open a door, cut a rope or any other means of escape brings feelings of certain death only to have that adrenaline high abruptly ended by 10-20 minutes of ****tery in the form of long drawn out boring ass conversations where the Protagonist never speaks and then forced to sit there or as I did got up and went to sleep, took a nap, did dishes, feed the dog, put the dishes away, painted a room, watched paint dry in said room or took a **** instead of listening to! AGAIN PACING In this game is horrible at best and nonexistent at worst. All the while working up to a bad ending im sure like so many others felt the conditions of which are also just pathetic and in order to achieve a good ending you basically Cant Kill Anyone is like saying why bother playing the ****ing game then!? The emotional pay off for playing the game is you died she lived but she hates you ohh well you dont care cause Your Dead!  Is by far the worst possible conclusion to an otherwise tedious endeavor into the Metro Series which doesn't even make sense in the first place as an Idea since the Half Life of Plutonium 239 THE MAIN INGREDIENT in Nuclear weapons the world over since the 1920s is over 20,000Years not 20-30years as the game would lead us to believe unlike a certain Nuclear Power Plant which should be using a much different Isotope with a massively shorter half life. The ONE Saving Grace is you can change attachments on the fly."
528,Bavey,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Метро Исход которое просто можно назвать хорошим и крепким продолжение серии. Как фанат серии остался доволен игрой. Анимации которые многие ругают выглядят в целом ""нормально"", про мимику персонажей правда уже такого не скажешь особенно походу диалогов.  Про баги ничего не скажу, так как не обращал на них внимание в связи отличным погружением в игру. В целом игру стоит пройти хотя бы 2 раза."
529,Olgierd,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"A very immersive game, exciting gunfights, crafting mechanics are not the best bit they are quite original. Superb story telling and atmosphere, ending matters on both your choices and your playstylethe only real problem is that the game is too short ans the forest area is too linear, not enough open world but you won't get bored. Now on the technical side I had no problem except a few (2 or 3) crashes on the 1.000 version of the game and my computer is far from being top of the line btw."
530,Bucksy,"Feb 25, 2019",9,"I thought I'd write a brief objective review since this game is getting review bombed for the Epic Store nonsense. For one, this game seems to be the shortest in the series if you don't count the time spent exploring the maps. That being said the story is well written and the open world exploration added to the series in this title is excellent. The environments while for the most part are excellent, they are not quite as atmospheric or as terrifying as the tunnels of the previous entries to the series. Overall the gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous titles, B+ at best. With A++ presentation its a definite buy, especially for fans of the series. Don't let the controversy scare you away from an excellent title."
531,MadElks_Tim,"Feb 25, 2019",9,"Well, Epic Store is a minus, but still - the game is quite good. Story rich, marvelous graphic, pretty good game play - that's what I call a good game! Probably one of the 10 Top Games 2019! Enjoy!"

Последняя глава так вообще шедевр, я в первой половине игре срал кирпичами и думал что все самое страшное и мерзкое позади...но я очень сильно ошибался, очень атмсоферно, мерзко и интересно. радиация одиночество и холод  и цель чувствовались как в живую. Я очень приятно удивлен , что игра показала такой класс..это супер, это очень крутая игра. Нытики конечно как всегда ноют, что поделать поколение избалованное и испорченное  всяким коммерческим дерьмом и лутбоксами....Метро Исход - определенно 1010.4A Game красавцы."
533,CountVoid,"Mar 15, 2019",10,"Incredible game. Beautiful, great characters, a grand journey, solid combat, and the open-world of some of the different areas is great. I don't have any major flaws with the game, I think it deserves a ten. I will say I encountered two serious bugs, but I only lost a few minutes of progress overall because of them which I say is forgivable. Also, I think Metro Exodus is far better than the last two Metro games. I wasn't sure I'd like Exodus since I thought the first two Metro games were just alright, but this game sure surpassed my expectations. ... And sure, I'm as annoyed as everyone else about the Epic Store exclusivity, but giving the game a low rating because of that is just silly. Talking about the GAME ITSELF: it is truly great. Well done developers."

I bought the game through epic and since then i've enjoyed every hour i have poured into the game trying to find every secret and get both endings. I can honestly say that this game for me is one of the best looking and most enjoyable experiences i've had with pc gaming. worth the buy"

538,Heardline,"Feb 16, 2019",8,"P.S Я если честно, очень разочарован людьми, ставящие низкие оценки из-за эксклюзивностью игры. Это полнейший дебилизм и не объективно. Да, это неприятно по отношению игрокам и ограничивает функционал, который дает Стим, но это не 4A Games решение, а издателя!*Теперь мое мнение об игре. Игру нельзя назвать игру года и т.д, а скорее ""Достойное продолжение"" и Лучшая игра в серии. Похвалю раскрытие персонажей, за каждого волнуешься и каждый запоминается, так же хороший сюжет, в особенности фанаты будут довольны. Так же, понравились идеи и разнообразные механики, реализованные в игре: Полу-открытый мир, крафтинг, кастомизация оружия, поезд и множество других мелких нововведения.*Что мне не понравилось. Ужасное попадается в глаза бюджетность и большое количество проблем в техническом плане, начиная от оптимизации и заканчивая анимациями, багами и кривым AI, он явно требуется в переработке и очень старый.*Лично мне, в этой игре не хватает RPG элементов, так как изучение мира никак не вознаграждается и мотивации этого делать - нет. Так же, требуется полностью переделать механику стелса и стрельбы, они очень устарели и да,  ДАЙТЕ ГОЛОС АРТЕМУ, уже 2к19 на дворе!Я прошел игру с большим удовольствием и доволен игрой, но я ожидал большего и более качественный продукт)"

540,opezdl,"Feb 18, 2019",9,"That's definitely a great game. Yet its a different kind of game, I would even call that a Russian-style Call of Duty with meaningful monologues.Do not expect a kojima-style game-play features. Metro is a road movie, with nice touch of gunfight, scavenging and a little horror.I really enjoyed how it switch player mood with music, effects and monologues ( you cant call those a dialogues :D )Great game overall if you're a fan of indie-style narratives and atmosphere. Plz ignore negative reviews from angry steam-boys. PS. for a Russians this game have a lot of hidden messages, mirroring politics, culture and overall situation around now-days Russia. I had enjoyed it, because its nice that Metro developers have same vision as i do."

BTW if you change you store to Ukraine region game cost only 1195 hrivnas - 44 Usd for the gold edition. Have played more than 20 hours never have lags, crashes. The atmosphere is awesome here,  have winter location, desert, forest. All the characters stories are exciting. The game has the problem with animation, once you kill the beasts corpses moving sometimes, enemies AI is not good, our hero is always silent...Post-soviet apocalypse is something new and should be interesting for gamers all over the world. Highly recommend to buy it."

Звичайно з виключеними Nvidia Hairworks і покращеним PhysX. Геймплей: було прикольно, коли замітив, що начіпивши на АК магазин від РПК і оптичний приціл, не вийшло покемперити, так як віддача була просто ппц...  стрільба мені сподобалася, відчувалась віддача зброї. ""Буханка"" просто топчик, жаль не було можливості в ній музику якусь запускати (типу магнітофон поставити, з можливістю знайти якісь касети, щоб потім послухати) =) Монстри трохи напрягали, особливо, коли ти собі так йдеш і тут в один момент підлітає ""демон"" і відправляє тебе в політ..., але в цьому був свій ""шарм"". Оточення: було цікаво досліджувати кожну локацію, так як розробники постаралися наповнити їх елементами які можуть розкзати історію кожного, хто загинув коли вибухнули ЯБ. Інтересу добавляло спостереження за сутичками між монстрами, або монстрами і людьми. Щодо діалогів та сюжету: дуже сильно не хватало коментарів Артема... Хотілося, щоб в деяких моментах він вставив своїх кілька слів і дав зрозуміти, що всі помиляються =) Цікаво слухати як спілкується команда між собою, це підсилювало атмосферу гри. Сюжет досить нетипічний, цікаво було спостерігати за його поворотами =) В загальному все чудово. Я рекомедую цю гру, якщо хтось ще її не грав :)"

554,LansCover,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"Метро Исход которое просто можно назвать хорошим и крепким продолжение серии. Как фанат серии остался доволен игрой. Метро получило линейно-открытый мир, более интересный сюжет(который всё же очень короткий, по факту хотелось бы больше), интересный дизайн уровней(приятно видеть в мониторе что то родное, хотя за окном этого родного хоть отбавляй), порадовали некоторые новые геймплейные фишки, графика действительно понравилась(хоть местами она и корявая). Анимации которые многие ругают выглядят в целом ""нормально"", про мимику персонажей правда уже такого не скажешь особенно походу диалогов. Обругать хочется плохую оптимизацию игры для PC, но в целом это поправимо. Про баги ничего не скажу, так как встретил всего 1 походу всего прохождения. В целом игру стоит пройти хотя бы раз, а вот западному игроку наверное будет ужасно скучно."
555,Miller1993,"Feb 17, 2019",10,I will not underestimate the rating because of the publisher. The game is cool.
556,COIASF,"Mar  3, 2019",4,"i uninstalled this game after just one hour of gameplay and the reasons are somehow personal ... - The cutscenes last way too long. At some point i was feeling like watching a movie instead of playing a fps.- The medkit system is **** The game doesn't give you a station to work on/craft stuff for the first missions and i found myself in a situation where i had to finish the church mission with almost 0 health because i didn't had any medkits left and i had absolutely no way to craft them . For me this is a big NO NO. I can't understand how a team of developers didn't think about this while working on the first missions of the game..- The dialogue is way too much and there are a lot of situations where the characters talk at the same time and you can't quite understand what they are saying. If you give me a piece of dialogue make sure i can hear it clearly..- The game seems poorly optmised. Although  the graphics aren't that high (compared to games like AC Oddysey, Doom etc ) and although i have a decent configuration (I5 6400,GTX 960 MSI 4G,12 G Ram) the game missions took a long time to load sometimes even crashing... And these issues where just for the first hour of gameplay.I don't even want to think what other issues would have existed if i continued playing the game to the full end. The only think that makes me feel good is the fact that i pirated the game because if i had spent 60 euros on this i would have killed myself."

558,Boldlime8,"Feb 17, 2019",8,I cannot bring myself to give this game anything higher than a 8 due to the controversy. But on quality of the game I will say it is one of the better games I have played at this time of the year. I have been enjoying this game. Now the biggest issue that I have found is that people are giving this game a negative review just because they did not like the swap to epic games store. A lot of those reviews are even stating they have refused to buy this game because of it and have not played it. That I feel is a practice that needs to stop being done. Vote with your wallet and do not try and use reviews as a weapon when you have not even played the game.
559,Games24,"Feb 16, 2019",5,"He jugado las primeras horas del juego y hay que decir a nivel de historia, jugable pinta genial, si has jugado los anteriores metro notaras que hay un cambio juagable ya que se añaden nuevas funciones como la personalización de armas, reparar la mascara de gas, etc... pero a nivel técnico hasta ahora es un desastre, la optimizacion no es buena, no puede ser que una GTX 1060 6gb vaya entre 40 y 60 fps viendo como otros juegos como wolfenstein 2 o doom que son bestias graficas vayan mejor hablando entre 60 y 70 fps en ultra. Tambien en las cinematicas algunos personajes desaparecen y vuelven repentinamente algo que me parece vergonzoso e injustificable ya que tambien Metro Exodus esta en Xbox One y Ps4 que en teoria son inferiores a un PC, ademas graficamente hay poca diferencia entre Metro Redux. Ojala 4Agames arregle todos estos problemas en nada. Antes de acabar muchas gracias 4Agames por hacer este juego tan maravilloso."
560,FREEZE35420,"Feb 17, 2019",9,This game is awesome i have bought the gold edition on Epic Store Game. No bug for this moment. All is really good just the IA that is bad. I play with my R290X MSI and a I5 4670K with Medium Settings for play with 60Fps (30FPS min on stress moments)
561,Tilbert,"Feb 26, 2019",0,"The game is very raw and ... wooden, with awkward animations, strange faces and to the limit with silly dialogues. The plot is based on elementary errors, the author doesn’t have any idea how radio suppression systems work, but lays it in the basis of the plot. The main character is silent throughout the game, the year 2019 is in the yard and they could not give him cues. The game is saturated with the most stupid and evil cranberries you can think of. The Russian military, hung with machine guns, in tattered quilted jackets and earflaps, swinging axes will crawl at you like zerg from all the cracks. At the same time, the ingenious AI, having reached you, will not even be able to understand what to do with this ax."
562,Alokin1337,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Metro Exodus - потрясающая игра. Да, есть проблемы с геймплеем, проблемы с оптимизацией, скандал с уходом со Steam. Но мать вашу, игра ""вывозит"" себя на атмосфере, сюжете, персонажах и обстановке. Еще ни одна игра не давала таких эмоций, когда ты просто выходишь в тамбур покурить. Банально звучит, но бытовые разговоры в этой игре сделаны шедеврально. К кому бы ты не зашел, все о чем-то разговаривают. Игра сделана от наших и для наших. Когда ты заходишь в разрушенный подъезд - спавшая краска, ржавые перила, кривые ступеньки - ты чувствуешь себя как дома. Когда ты гуляешь по разрушенным домам России, у тебя постоянно возникает чувство чего-то родного. Иконы, фарфор, советская мебель, агитационные плакаты в детском лагере и спавшая краска - зарубежным игрокам просто не понять этого. Сюжет, кто бы что ни говорил, отличный. Особенно кульминация. Я играл во множество игр, но ни в одной из них не было такой шедевральной кульминации, как в Metro. Причем ее шедевральность достигается постановкой, персонажами и диалогами. Диалоги кстати также имеют русский калорит.И да, несмотря на то, что переход в Epic Games Store был подлейшим поступком, ругать надо Deep Silver и Koch Media, а не 4a games. А особенно не надо ставить 0 баллов на метакритике. Да, Epic Games полная помойка, но сама игра - шедевр, а отзывы в первую очередь надо делать на игру, а не на поступки издателя.Вообщем, это безусловно лучшая игра 2019 года, как минимум для жителей СНГ. Игра от наших и для наших."
563,KuzyaLakomkin,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"Игра офигенная, сюжет офигенный и графон. Местами графика была похоже но только на одной локации, в остальном эти переходы по локациям где своя графика свои мутанты и свои механики, это круто и судить за то что там мало метро это глупо считая что игра вышла по роману Дмитрия Глуховского, зачем выпускать такую же метро если 2 таких игры уже есть. Играю на ультра на 1050ti без лагов и фризов, графика радует глаз. К тому же эти поспешные выводы что метро мало, так вы подождите когда дополнения выйдут."

565,ancientscream,"Feb 20, 2019",9,"Amazing game, the level of visual fidelity, detail and scale of effort from a graphical perspective really has to be seen to be believed, (speaking as  person who did 3d visualisation for a living). There were a few bugs on launch, some patched pretty quickly. The RTX GI if one stops to observe it especially outside in sky/moon or sunlit scenarios really is a great improvement, but the pace that most people run through an FPS game, many will not notice, especially on motion blurry LCD monitors, which is sad but also a great testament to how good 4A can make there games look without raytracing. But when graphics cards are powerful enough to run this in 4k with RTX on and a decent HDR tv, this game will look utterly amazing, I think this will be one of these games which may also be patched to improve it in the future graphically, imagining 4A adding in ray traced reflections later on more powerful RTX cards on an enhanced edition would take it up another notch again, the detail at scale in this game is incredible, this is a game to savour, there are some textures in later maps that load a little slow sometimes possible to get the character/story stuck in a few spots etc, save often, though auto saves are pretty frequent. I'm sure such issues will be patched pretty fast. I think slower replays will reveal more and more of the graphical talent at work, the initial bugs aside its worth a buy imo, it also plays pretty well and runs pretty solid, but it needs a decent recent card to make the most of it, the story, characters and gameplay elements are also very detailed. There are many here reviewing this as a 'zero game' which you should honestly ignore, as they are reactionary aggressive reviews on the basis the game was released on epics store, but really such reviews are taking the piss out of what is essentially an amazing game, I think this game will become a benchmark for graphical fidelity in the future. Its also an amazing achievement considering its done by only 150 staff. games have come a long way since colossal cave ;)"

If you want a copy of this game, I recommend the special CPY edition."
567,Plan3tX,"Feb 23, 2019",8,"Disclaimer first: This is the first Metro game I've played (read books though so I'm familiar with story and universe)Metro Exodus is certainly a very good story driven game which take you along the journey through post apocalyptic Russia. The story and world is really immersive and I advise to take some time to explore it instead of just rushing though. Characters are memorable, they feel authentic and I've attached to them throughout the game. I thoroughly advocate to play with Russian voiceover - it's so much better and authentic than English one. That being said dialogues and monologues (Artyom is unfortunately mute) are unnecessarily overlonged and it's getting boring after some time.In terms of game mechanics there is nothing new, it's a good old FPS with some ""survival"" elements like crafting (of course), gas mask with filters that need changing every once in awhile or manually charged torch although that's nothing new in Metro games I've heard.Technically the game had a bumpy start with a lot of bugs (latest patch fixed some of those) and poor optimisation so if you're rocking older/cheaper PC I'd wait until they sort it out or modernise your specs. Is the game visually worth it? Mostly yes, it has stunning views and polished details but sometimes it's uneven with places/things looking not as good as the rest. All in all 4A Games is a small, developing studio and the game is more than good-looking and playable unlike some of the latest big studio games (khem Fallout 76 khem).Overall I rate this game 8-/10, it's not not in anyway ground-breaking but it delivers  in both story, gameplay as well as graphics. It could have even been 9/10 if not for all technical and optimisation issues it has now. Certainly a must-buy!"

I don't understand. The game itself published the specs, you guys are either completely blind, or just worthless at reading (same things). Go check the minimum specs for each thing first.

А бамбёжка из за Epic Game, вы серьёзно? Вам ли не похер на какой платформе игра? Мне лично всеравно, будь она даже в ориджин. Моя оценка 10 из 10, игра супер и разработчики просто красавцы."
586,PaperfoxArts,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"In my personal opinion this game is a masterpiece in the scope of what it sets out to do. It is not without issues of course but in my case they never took away from the overall amazing experience. I have never felt more immersed in a game and its every aspect of it that adds to the experience. Visually its the wonderfully realistic graphics with its natural lighting thanks to the RTX Global Illumination,  detailed models and textures and great use of effects, all while still running great on my  machine. (i7-6800k, 2080Ti, everything on Ultra at 1440p, even 4K with DLSS) Sound wise, its the detailed environment soundscapes, the scary mutant noises, the immersive weapon sounds and for the most part also the voice acting, all elevated to the next level by the implementation of Dolby Atmos spatial audio resulting in an amazingly atmospheric and immersive experience. And the gameplay is true to its roots while improving on it greatly with the crafting and on-the-fly weapon modding system, better AI and clever use of previously introduced and new mechanics. Especially on hard difficulties it is as unforgiving and tense as ever and does not take you by the hand, like most games these days, which is a good thing in my book. The balance of the linear, dark metro levels similar the previous games and the new open worldly areas, featuring detailed world building and the same atmosphere and immersion we know and love, come together connected by a very human, emotional and in my opinion well crafted story and result in an experience that is a very clear must play for Metro and survival horror lovers for me. My personal score for it is a 9/10, plus 1 to offset some of the review bombing crap going on because of the unfortunate epic store drama and the people managing to have a bad experience because they don't quite get the game and how to play it. Im sorry for you if you ran into technical problems, I personally did not, but for those who did, I hope it gets resolved soon, so you can enjoy this game as well."

Озвучка на высоте. Геймплей не плохой, но отсутствие доп. квестов , делает игру очень маленькой 14-16 ч. Да есть баги и их достаточно.

590,Santiago1,"Feb 17, 2019",10,пишу положительный отзыв по двум причинам. Первое: хорошая игра. Второе: не хочется чтобы продолжение игры было только на PlayStation и Xbox One
591,SlenSim,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"Пролог: У меня за всю игру была только одна фатальная ошибка, которая решилась тем, что я просто перезапустил игру, вау! Все, кто занижает оценки игре, только потому что игра не запустилась, вы конченные!У меня тоже при первом запуске была проблема, не прогружалась меню, но эта проблема в моём железе, а не в игре. Этот рычаг, что вы используете - вам не поможет, вы лишь ухудшаете положение своё и разработчика.Начну, пожалуй.На своём стареньком компьютере, в 25 кадров я проходил этот шедевр. То, что игра у меня вообще запустилась - это магия! Игра достойная, не без погрешностей, но она стоит вашего времени, которое вы на неё выделите. Я играл во все части Метро, и прекрасно знаю все её проблемы и достоинства. Метро:Исход - это новый большой шаг для серии.Спасибо, 4A Games и Дмитрию Глуховскому, за эту прекрасную вселенную в которой я провёл каждую минуту с удовольствием. Трилогия Метро - навсегда останется в моём сердце ярким светом и никакая тьма не сможет заглушить его.Надеюсь, это не финальный раунд Артёма в этой битве, ведь столько историй ещё не рассказано. Желаю вам бюджет покрупнее на следующую игру, ну и успешных продаж этой части, ведь она и правда отличная, с душой."
592,glebkakrutoy,"Feb 17, 2019",10,"Долго ждал игру, хотел сделать предзаказ в стиме, но из-за истории с эпиками передумал брать, но в день релиза РЕШИЛСЯ и взял игру там, за 2 бессонных ночи прошёл игру и понял что это шедевр.Атмосфера на высшем уровне, что я имею ввиду:на локациях полно всяких вещей которые помогают погрузится в атмосферу России, советские календари в домах, кастрюли с цветочками-это нечто.Отдельный + разрабам за знакомые песни, как только выходишь из лазарета слышишь песню Аукцыон дорога, которую позднее можно поймать в поезде, ДА ТУТ ДАЖЕ ЕСТЬ ЦОЙ. А когда дали погонять на буханке я сидел как пятилетний мальчик и просто улыбался.Персонажей прописали настолько хорошо что с ними не хочется прощаться, они воспринимаются не как бездушные npc, а как живые люди.Особенно понравился последний эпизод в Новосибирске, когда прибываешь туда становится жутко, но то что происходит потом это просто не поддаётся объяснению. Когда считая что город абсолютно мёртв, находишь маленького мальчика, это всё настолько сильно ударяет, что просто невозможно описать.А концовка заставляет заплакать каким бы ты не был.10 буханок из 10"
593,Anohich,"Feb 17, 2019",8,Игра первым делом берёт своей своей атмосферой и глубоким сюжетом.Но игра плохо оптимизирована.Так же мне не понравилось отсутствие голоса у Артёма. Это порой доходило даже до абсурда. Но в целом игра очень зашла. Давно я так не радовался одиночным играм.
594,Keratakid,"Feb 17, 2019",10,"Dont mind the reviews, this is actually a really amazing game but people keep voting 0 because of the epic store incident. Now i dont like epic store either but rating this game 0/10 just because of that is unfair and misleading to people who are thinking about buying the game. Now talking about the game: I played both of the previous Metro games and i can say they are one of the best shooter games i've ever played and Exodus isn't an exception. Yes it is quite different from the previous Metro games, but it's a good kind of different. The game is way more open than the previous ones but there are a lot of ares that feel claustrophobic and make you play at the edge of your seat. The choices you make matter even more now, i'm not gonna spoil anything about the game buy giving examples but be about careful how you play.The atmosphere is one of the best i've ever seen in any videogame so far and i think everyone will agree with me on this one. Graphics, just like the atmosphere, is amazing but it takes a beast of a pc to play it at 4k extreme without the game turning into a powerpoint slideshow.  I have a rx480 which can run Ultra 60fps in 1080p and i can say it looks quite amazing i dont think my eyes could've handled 4k extreme.Lastly i must say the sense of survival in this game is unmatchable to any other games. Just like the previous Metro games but improved. If you liked the previous games you'll also like this one, if you played metro only for the ultra-close quaters combat, then you won't like this game like the other ones. The only serious problem with this game are the bugs and crashes. I played for approx. 7 hours and my game crashed twice, which is really good for a new released game nowadays (sadly) but it still sucks."
595,EXODUSlove,"Feb 17, 2019",10,"Почему Metro Exodus шедевр?В этой игре сделано все, чтобы тебе, дураку не было скучно. Метро не может быть полностью открытым миром, потому что пропадет целостность сюжета, а ведь не сюжет в этой вселенной так важен? Но так и быть, следуя трендам, вам угодили, дали большие локации с кучей лута, пасхалок и дополнительных NPC. Вам сделали нечто новое и оригинальное! Люди из метро наконец вышли на поверхность и смогли дышать без масок. Разве не это мечта каждого, кто живет в тоннелях? Разве не в этом сюжет и главная миссия Артема, Ордена и людей в целом?Атмосфера совершенно не исчезла, все тот постапокалипсис, все также порой мрачно и опасно, те же атмосферные мелодии и звуки, те же часовые прослушки разговоров персонажей. Сделали бы 4A Games игру снова в метро - вы бы сказали что это скучно и такое уже было.  Смеюсь с людей которые говорят что слишком похоже на Сталкер. Не хочу показаться гением, но в обоих играх постапокалипсис с радиацией и мутантами, и очень(!) странно что игры похожи.Сюжет и концепт с поездом - лучшее что могли придумать разработчики, как средство быстрого изменения локаций и как задумка в целом. Конец невероятно трогательный. Ума не приложу какие люди пишут что конец никакой. Ревели всем стримом.Графика, вопреки всем порезам, осталась восхитительной. Свет, блики, рефлексы, текстуры, детали, вода, физика - все безупречно имхо.Да, игра имеет баги и прочие недостатки. Но это разве недостаток одного бедного метро?) Многие игры на выходе имеют баги и странности. Все решается просто - фиксами. Снижать баллы из-за этого до нуля это до невозможности глупо. Про травлю насчет выхода в Epic Games, а не в Steam вообще no comments..Итог прост: Вам дали абсолютно новое Метро, Метро, которым остается только восхищаться, Метро, к которому вы оказались не готовы.Искренне надеюсь, что этот обвал рейтинга закончится и оценка станет такой, которую игра реально заслуживает. И вообще очень обидно, что за такие глупости вы засираете наших же ребят, которые сделали для вас эту прекрасную серию игр."

Над Авророй, персонажами и их отношениями, над атмосферой в самом поезде так вообще была проделана титаническая работа, он великолепен, там есть целая отдельная радиостанция с песнями Цоя, а отсылки в диалогах на его песни вообще то. Да что там, в игре можно бухать со своими товарищами, что ещё нужно? Игры, где можно бухать с любимыми персонажами априори восхитительны, масс эффект, ведьмак третий, метро вот. Даже не смотря на то, что персонажи были только в книге 2035 и самом исходе, а в предыдущих частях о большинстве из них ничего сказано не было, за время путешествия к ним привязываешься и действительно можешь назвать их своими братьями по крови, в химию между персонажами веришь, отношения между ними и самим Артёмом прописаны отлично, с некоторых шуток действительно проорал, с одной так вообще верещал на всю хату, в играх такого давно не встречал. Так вот, в общем, большей части всё понравилось, были косяки и странные моменты, но в остальном, не смотря на все проблемы, как самой игры, так и всей шумихи, что вокруг неё поднялась, всё довольно хорошо, хоть и можно было немного лучше."
602,MegaLuter,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"I like it. 10/10P.S. Passed the game. Changed the rating from 8 to 10/10. Masterpiece. I will not spoil. For a long time I did not empathize with the game characters to cry of them, but this game do it. Before you rate the game - go through it to the end.Игра мне понравилась.П.С. Прошел игру. Изменил оценку с 8 на 10/10. Шедеврально. Не буду спойлерить. Давно я не проникался так персонажами чтобы реветь из-за них. Прежде чем вы поставите оценку игре - пройдите ее до конца.Баги - пару раз ловил тупых НПС.  Но загрузка с последней точки все чинила. Других багов не ловил.Немного критики: В зеркале нет отражения Артема...- разработчики серьезно? все говорят об инновационных технологиях, а у вас нет отражения  в зеркале? Да я нашел зеркало в этой игре.Все фразы слишком театральны и напыщены. Не чувствуется  реальности из-за этой театральности. Все НПС говорят какой-то бред и при этом губы у них двигаются не подходяще под голос. В игре нет четкого понятия когда тебя видно, а когда нет - я про стелс.

606,Shadowmean,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Метро! Хочу начать с того что я являюсь большим фанатом серии. Прошёл предыдущие части по несколько раз, прочитал оригинальную трилогию книг. И для такого человека, как я, игра получилась почти идеальной! Поясню:Фирменная атмосфера метро, за которую я боялся больше всего, никуда не исчезла.По поводу геймплея, всё не так однозначно: некоторые устаревшие и неуместные механики (зажатие кнопки для того чтобы влезть по лестнице или протиснутся в узкое пространство), стрельба, в частности непонятный прицел (полёт пули не соответствует прицелу, и я сейчас говорю не про снижение пули на дальней дистанции, всегда есть шанс не попасть в центр прицела пулей даже в упор) , очень странная физика прыжка (Артём как будто летит, а не прыгает), их ещё много, но остальные по большей части незначительны, так что акцентировать на них внимание не хотелось бы.И вот я добрался до графики. Сразу скажу - я не обращаю внимание на графику в играх, для меня нет никакой разницы между графикой в оригинальной Metro 2033 и Exodus. Для меня картинка отходит на второй план, в отличии от системных требований! Они какие-то завышенные. У меня компьютер по комплектации ровно подходит под рекомендованные настройки, но даже на минималках игра умудряется подлагивать. Так же хочу отметить резкую, можно даже сказать дерганную, анимацию.По тому что я написал раньше можно сделать вывод, что игра вышла довольно посредственной. НЕТ!!! Все её недостатки, перечисленные выше, с лихвой перекрываются главным в элементом серии Metro - сюжетом. Тут он просто великолепен! 4Agames прекрасно перенесли книжный сюжет на экраны мониторов.В итоге: объективная оценка игры - 8,5. Но из-за нытиков стимбоев и просто дурачков, не разобравшихся в ситуации, занизивших оценку игры до 6, я ставлю 10. Не верите в то что оценка не справедливая. Что же, обратите внимание на то, что все оценки игры - либо 10, либо 0, причем отзывы с нулями никогда не расписаны, максимум критики, которая там есть - неправильный лаунчер или жалобы на ""русофобию"", это даже звучит смешно."
607,Imperator07,"Feb 19, 2019",9,"So far I have enjoyed Metro Exodus. It's a nice change of pace from the first two games to have more open environments with smaller, more claustrophobic environments to explore. Great visuals, although some of the character's animations are a little over enthusiastic. Performance has been good so far on Very High settings, usually hanging around 90-100 FPS (1080ti, Ryzen 2600x, 16gb RAM) but notice some frame rate dips when I use the binoculars. No crashes so far, although I have encountered a few audio bugs. Gameplay wise, playing on at least Ranger difficulty is a must. Resources are pretty sparse and I have been forced to conserve ammo and hunt additional resources, which make the fire fights feel more high-risk. Dying in a few hits helps counter the fact that the AI is not the sharpest. The guns look and feel great and the ability to swap out parts on the fly is fun, letting you adapt to the situation as you need. All in all, if you enjoy the Metro universe (both the books and the game) this game is packed with lots of world building. Listening into character conversations reveals a lot of fun backstory (sometimes almost too much at once)."

611,dalerhalimov,"Feb 18, 2019",9,"This game is so atmospheric! And I absolutely love the design of weapons and gadgets. And the idea of post apocalyptic Moscow is insanely good! And yes I know about its sins ( not 2019 graphics, lags here and there, bad lip sync). But you have to remember that it's an Ukrainian company and they didn't have the budget like Far Cry, Uncharted, Witcher and etc games had. So, you can't really compare it to them. What they did it's pretty damn good, so imagine if they had a good budget. And the surroundings, especially inside the buildings and apartments is so a accurate and it's a shame that people abroad won't get the same effect and feelings. They will not even pay attention to it. I really hope that some big company will see potential and will fund the developers. I really wish them good luck."
612,Splash02,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"Game has so many negative reviews only because of mad russian players who triggered after the game has left steam store until 2020. That's the real cause of that bad-reviews stuff.To be truthful with you game is fire and I feel really sad for 4A Games cuz Metro doesn't deserve these deceiving reviews. It worths to pay attention to this game. It has a good plot (especially if you've played previous parts and you are a fan of the series) and amazing atmosphere so new players will be interested too. It shows us good graphics, the best-detailed Russia you've ever seen in the game and as I said amazing plot and atmosphere. That's it, obviously game's lit, you must check it out."
613,21grams,"Mar  6, 2019",8,"UPDATED - I will leave first impressions and add final notes at the end. ========================================================== FIRST IMPRESSION (was 6/10) The game looks good and feels very atmospheric - as one would expect from Metro game. The shooting feels great and guns handle very well. Story opening felt very interesting to me, but will see how this rolls out. Visually it's quite impressive, very high attention to detail, but at the same time some locations feel a bit lackluster and uninspired - but overall, game looks really great, Sadly the game is not so great on technical side of things. There are some performance issues, but foremost there is quite a lot of glitches and bugs, also severe audio issues which take away quite a lot from immersion. Also it doesn't seem to support anything wider than 16:9, it lacks some key settings on PC one could expect from such major game in 2019 (like FOV slider, turning off motion blur, etc). It really needs quite a few patches, so better wait. I grabbed this while I could on steam, so at least that - but in current situation - my advise would be to wait, at least for few patches and maybe even steam release (or rather re-release - because it was pulled off to shill with Epic Fail Store) next year. ====================================================FINAL NOTE (after completing game) The game turned out better than I expected. It's quite a canonical journey filled with moral choices of which - many are not that apparent. The world is very immersive and it being more open in several chapters only adds to immersion with a lactation diversity and different year seasons. The gunplay is improved a lot upon predecessors with quite a variety of weapons to chose from and very nice customization options. All in all it's great game and quite a ride. As final negatives I would name:1) All culmination action happens in non-interactive cutscenes (not the live action) and it feels like game is taking control from you in best moments, thus takes a fun away. Slightly disappointing and a bit lazy design sadly. 2) Dialogue (or rather should I say monologue for most part) delivery felt quite dated without any interaction from Artyom in any conversation. 3) Epic store exclusive - it's great game with anti-consumer exclusivity on a story with bs policies, lack of features, poor consumer support. Only small chunk of us got away with pre-orders on steam. I never pre-order but they leave me no choice. 4) as mentioned in early impressions - lack of certain options in settings."
614,NoBodysGamer,"Feb 15, 2019",10,"Its not like last two games, its good but Open World made it WORSE!They could of EASILY made this game semi-linear inside metro by giving you missions and sending you across different stations, where you decide to which station you go or moved the game to Saint-Petersburg's Metro but they made a BAD choice of going outside to make the game open.NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS! As far as graphics go: Its amazing, DLSS+RTX +4K, no issues, unlike the whiny kids down in the comments i have no issues.The made the bad choice of making it open world, i would of been better if stayed linear or semi-open world INSIDE metro or full on Fallout type RPG"

622,FreedomFigher,"Feb 18, 2019",8,"+ Interesting story+ Weapon customization+ Nice looking open world locations+ Dive in Metro universe again - Animation sucks badly- subtitles and dialogues sometimes not synchronized- Epic Game launcher ( game freezes sometimes, sometimes crashed)- not very interesting locations ( lack or interacting things)- Cant skip dialogues- Game is very short- shooting could be better- Night vision goggles improvement changes nothing- lack of ammo patches even with upgraded armor- boats are too slow and car is too clumsy Overall game is good but it could be much better. This game is not AAA it is AAa. You could not create open world. Better create longer story line, improve animations and polish game better.

623,Butcher2225,"Feb 19, 2019",9,"I don't get what people are complaining about... I think it was awesome! Poor optimization? Funny, I don't have a very good PC and I rarely get above 60 FPS with high graphics, but with this game most of my game went around at 60 to 80 FPS. Open world? Well, no. It isn't actually an open-world game, and neither is it supposed to be - this may have been a slight marketing mishap. It's not really even a semi-open-world, rather there are just a couple of extra places to scavenge, and that's exactly their point: just to get some extra items and resources. There are no countless amounts of side quests and endlessly long mazes just for exploring. It's a story-driven and really a quite linear action FPS game. The story is good, even though there was a few predictable moments. The characters are great and you really bond with them (even though, a few syncing problems and the animations could be better, but didn't bother me that much). The world is amazing: the world looks beautiful and the details are really nice to look at. Many times I had to stop to just look at the all the interiors of the tunnels and buildings - yes, there are still a lot of underground, dark tunnels and interiors: it's definitely not just an open surface world. The atmosphere is very captivating and thrilling. I seriously recommend playing with headphones and turning on the surround sound. My only concerns are that there just a few frustrating moments (then again, what game didn't have any?). The game was clearly best played on hardcore difficulty, as then the action and combat was way more compelling and had just the good amount of challenge, but occasionally there were some moments that the enemies seemed to be able to headshot me when I was literally just peaking out behind a building, and one boss did feel a little like a bullet sponge, but other than that: definitely worth playing on hardcore as the resources are scarce and you are forced to explore and search every corner so that you can survive, and noticing that you run out of filters or medkits really created the correct kind of suspense. Other concern was the length of the game: the story just kind of ended out of the blue and it was somewhat a bit anti-climatic. One last, truly open, world to the end would have been a notch-on. But other than that, I would definitely recommend this game: just don't expect a new Fallout with huge open world, loads of side quests and free-roam. No, this is not like that: I guess the abundance of open-world games has really become such a trend, that now they market all games as open-world games, if there is even just one a bit bigger place."

Average fps on max graphical settings is 70. The game is pretty much looks like the other games in a series and i really like it. This is a good singleplayer game which i havent seen in years. Seriously, i don't know how Epic Games offended those kids but the game is awesome!"

Метро Исход, это удачное сочетание сюжета, графики и музыки, да порой текстурки шалят и немного фризит, но нереальная сюжетка и очень качественная озвучка нивелируют все мелочи.P.S. Очень советую игру"
626,Vitalyanu_com,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Советую, очень хорошая игра, если не придираться к мелочам, вернее к ним и не стоит придираться, ибо где их нет, при наличии мощного железа картинка прекрасная, сюжет (пишут банальный) нет он захватывающий и чтобы его оценить нужно пройти все и не спеша.Очень понравилось что мировоззрение героев как и их судьба зависит и меняется от принятых решений. Да, Артем всю игру молчит, но и мистер Фримен тоже! Мне кажется что это один из проектов который интересно будет пройти несколько раз, что сейчас редкость.Ps. Да, игра как-то в спешке и криво сменила магазин (издателя) но это не делает хуже саму игру, или команду ее создателей, от них это никак не зависело, а то, что все в игре делалось с любовью, русскоязычный игрок вменяемого состояния просто не может не заметить. Советую всем кому понравилась игра оставить не полениться здесь хороший отзыв, а то хейтеры нулей своих понаставят, потеряем еще одного хорошего притом нашего разработчика и будем все под диктовку EA вечно гонять по кругу в игры по типу  CS GO."

Trial and error showed me it did not like my high end NVIDIA card and I had to switch to my laptops integrated graphics card. The result was playing the game on settings I have not used for years. The whole wretched experience was made worse by the exaggerated motion blur you simply can't turn off. I actually started feeling nauseous after trying to play for a short time. In the end reached the conclusion did not get what I asked for and have since sought a refund. In my view a game that needed much more testing including end players. 0/10 from me. 0/10.

655,ZRaz,"Mar  7, 2019",4,"Been a huge fan of the series, as well as the STALKER games in which it pays homeage to. I still have all those (and those bellow) installed in fact. That said, I am disappointed with this game. It could have been so much more - the chance to unleash the potential of the Metro universe, to surpass the STALKER series which was not been possible before given its constrained budget. Unfortunately, it fails badly - too much focus on graphics and the push towards RTX that it misses the mark entirely. It became a 'very' average shooter in a bright gleaming package. Nothing more P.S. Im surprised that youtubers dont even talk about these, goes to show that they're merely reviewers, and not real players. And no, Anthem and such games do not make you an FPS fan. Lets look at these things objectively. I have been a gamer since, i know what the FPS renaissance looked like: -Far Cry 1, et al.-Crysis 1 and warhead (the rest are junk)-Doom 3, et al.-Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl, et al.-Metro, et al.-Fear 1 (the others were garbage)-Fallout 3 and 4-Mass Effect 1,2,3 (andromeda is garbage)-Unreal Engine games-MUCH MORE I know what i'm talking about. Pros:-Immerserive atmosphere brought about by its graphics.-Graphics. Simply the best looking FPS to date. Better than a modded Cryengine 1 which you can push via the ini file.-A decent crafting system.-Dynamic weather which was adapted from Stalker games.-Good intent on storytelling and voice acting, though a bit exaggerated on the english version. Cons: READ CAREFULLY.-Its a surprisingly linear and 'empty' experience despite its huge world.-Forcefully sluggish narrative that feels more dragging than immersive.-It feels more of a glorified tech demo for the RTX line, rather than a polished game.-A very shallow narrative, that questions logic and character choices when trying to immerse yourself in the world. Eg. Mute protagonist, dialogue choices, character choices, circumstances given your actions.-Confusing/Questionable morality system that FORCES you not to use your guns to get the good ending. You kill too many enemies = your companion dies, because you failed to pull the trigger at the end? Ehh? Hence, making run-and-gun feeling punishable instead of rewarding.-AI is dead on arrival. I mean that quite literally. Its the worst i have ever seen in this series. Enemies lining up to get shot, stand not reacting to you, not reacting to light, etc. This is what separated STALKER (its predecessor and core influence) from the rest. It was a 'real' world via A-LIfe. This game isnt, and the more you play the more it slaps youi in the face with that fact.-Gunplay is broken. I have enemies sniping me with a burst pistol from 2km away, and you can see their bullets trails traveling in a straight line. Wtf. I have a sniper that either drops an enemy on the floor in 1 hit, or tosses him 20m from his current position.-Clipping issues and glitches.-Enemy hit response to projectiles feels noticeable odd. Assault rifles feel weak.-Very limiting save mechanics. Metro and STALKER are great games in their own respective ways, but Metro Exodus is not. Mechanics that work inside a tunnel - will not work in an open world. It has so many titles in which it was supposed to learn from - yet it blindly trudges along waiving its shiny new paintjob."

658,Vaan72,"Apr 22, 2019",2,"Metro 2033, people live in the metro systems because the air outside is not breathable, there is radiation everywhere, giant bats lurk the whole city and everything is overrun by mutants. Then some years passed and Metro Exodus, the surface has working trains, working cars, vans, people living in villages, guns are everywhere and of nice quality.Guess a WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR WAR isn't really that bad, people took one lifetime or two in shelters and now everything is okay, mutants aren't barely as present, radiation doesn't kill anymore, the air seems a lot better because you see a lot of people without masks, this game opens with it just squatting and taking a huge dump on the ENTIRE plot and universe. So, how's the game itself? Just barely fun, it's short, the guns are pretty much recycled, the enemies too, the same core gameplay, same engine (IT'S ALMOST A DECADE OLD NOW), pretty handholdy and most of all, the game completely lacks tension, in the first minutes you get attacked, bit, bludgeoned, shot, left without a mask but nah don't worry, you're pretty much superman now.Artyom used to be the underdog hero and Metro used to be gritty, now it's pretty much russian Harry Potter. Gamers this day and age are completely braindead, this game's ratings shows, it just shat on the entire lore and world it took so much time to build, people see cool graphics and effects, pretty guns that make nice sounds and say ""yeah definitively a 7"", this game is **** it does not belong in the metro series and if you are willing to give this positive ratings and encourage lazy crap like this, congratulations, you're the one to blame for the state of gaming right now so shut the **** up when companies release crap games, you encouraged it."

661,Nigeleo,"May  2, 2019",10,"The game is excelent.(spoiler) It expanded from the metro to the wild. It divided the gameplay between corridor play which is still the same good thing as it was in earlier games and open map, which are just big enough for some exploring, there are side quests now, I liked them very much, they are mentioned in a natural way by characters and are also marked on map. I played on the hardest difficulty with limited UI and I must say that the feeling from the game is superb.The saves on the open map are done by some locations as well as sleeping which is ok, too bad you can't save just by being there. The biggest problem for me was that some NPC groups are ment to not be killed and you are HEAVILY punished for doing that, but at the same time, the first encounter with such people, you are not warned enough I would say and also the way you are punished is kinda weird for me, so I didn't like that very much but funny enough the later encounter with such groups make much more sense, I kinda wish they would maybe swap the first map with the second or warned the player a little bit more. It created that fear for me that killing anybody is bad which is not true(in the game :D) but at the same time I started to thing about if the kills are justified not only by game buy by my own justice.You see a bunch of guys in a building and they are marked as ""bandits"", great just kill them all, the game is ok with that, but then you watch them for a little while and you are like, they are ok, you dont' see them robbing people or talking about it, they are talking about some other stuff. My point is,  you need to distingwish between game ""killable"" groups and vise versa but in some general justice code this doesn't have to be true but the game will punish you for killing them. The game crashed once for me which is fine, the optimalisation was also good."

Sound, graphics, story, characters, voice acting, all great.  Had a couple MAJOR issues on Miscrosoft's Games for Windows app via game pass, but other than that this is yet another top notch installment int he Metro world.  Hope there is another. Approximately 7-8 hours in and just finished the first open world area of Yorga, and now in the internal government base and this has Metro written all over it!!  Cannibals everywhere!!  No idea how people can give this a crappy score, because it is just as good as the other games.  The open world segment felt very rewarding when exploring all areas.  Story telling is also just as good.  So far this game is a 9 out of 10 and I'm not even 10 hours in.  I expect my score to remain the same, all said and done. Also, not sure how these people are having so many technical issues, but maybe it's because I am just now playing the game in April of 2020.  ZERO issues on my rig.  Playing at 1440p, extreme settings, RTX, hairworks and Tessellation off, AF x 16 enabled, all at 60 fps with slight drops in frame-rate from time to time."

665,racing_heart,"Mar 14, 2019",10,"Скажу что атмосфера и эмоции в этой игре тебя завлекают на много часов- она затягивает тебя своей красотой не только мира, но и персонажами и отношениями между ними, ведь знаете, нету таких игр, где можно сидеть, слушать обсуждение своей команды выполненного задания, под стаканчик чего покрепче и смеяться над их шутками, приправленной песнями Цоя на фоне, или же слушать размышления о жизни своей жены, пока она лежит у тебя на коленях, не в одной другой игре так не передаётся ощущение, что ты в ответе за своего человека, кстати сама она тоже постоянно о тебе думает, и это очень хорошо показано. Или же путешествовать в поезде, который по-сути стал вашим домом на колёсах, играть на гитаре проникновенные песни, курить с товарищем, который говорит вроде как по-деревенски, но так по-родному, все эти фразочки ""етить, ентой, значица"" или ""Вот такие вот пироги с котятами"", это всё такое родное, ты ощущаешь что это всё твоё, даже вещи, которые просто стоят в домах и хижинах могут быть у вас дома, у ваших бабушек с дедушками, команда из 150 человек (!!!), сделала невообразимо сильный мир, в каждом его проявлении которого прослеживает наше, родное.Сюжет- он бесподобен, начиная от светлой цели в первой половине, заканчивая переживаниями и постоянными мыслями в голове ""ну что же там как там сейчас"".Первая половина хороша на открытый мир и изучение местности, при этом даже ваши враги имеют свои истории, которые приятно слушать, и после которых ты задашься вопросом ""А стоит ли их убивать, это такие же люди, как и я"".Во второй половине всё переворачивается, цель меняется, и не для более приоритетную для всего экипажа, а для самого Артёма (тк грозит опасность тому, что ему дорого больше всего в жизни (не буду спойлерить)).Параллельно с этим, своими действия вы влияете на судьбу некоторых членов вашего экипажа, ну и конечно же, концовки, их тут две, по стандарту: плохая и хорошая.Говоря о концовках, и вообще финальных моментах тут идеально всё, и речь, и сама подача сюжета, и угрызения Артёма, и саундтрек, он идеален (Race Against Fate-12 из 10).В конечных эпизодах игра выжимает тебя, ты полностью вжился в эту роль, ты переживаешь также, как переживает Артём, твои эмоции и переживания игра скручивает как губку, ты не можешь не о чём другом думать, кроме как о достижении своей цели, и это приправлено прекрасно вписывающимся саундтреком, и горькой потерей одно из членов экипажа заставляет тебя пустить слезу (специально не говорю реветь, мужики не поймут, хотя по сути все они ревели, много кто это говорил :) ) Сам конец (хорошая концовка), прекрасен, не оставит равнодушным никого, поверьте.В конце, хочу сказать, я прошёл много игр, и из них франшиза Метро всегда будет занимать особое место на полке, эта игра однозначно 10/10."

Что касательно звуков в игре, сделано все на совесть, однако виднеется либо недостаток бюджета либо сроки выхода игры на рынок(взяты звуки из игры Сталкер). А теперь мое любимое - сюжет. Тут все сложно, с одной стороны он мне очень понравился, однако концовка меня немного убила(хорошая), можно было сделать ее более эффектней. P.S. есть задатки на продолжение)))))). В общем и целом игра зашла на ура 4AGames продолжайте в том же духе. Игра очень хороша +++++++++++++++++++++. Не понимаю людей которые ставят 0 или 1 за оптимизацию(поправять), а про лаунчер я вообще молчу(неодекваты)."

Атмосфера, сам дух игры  тебя успокаивает,погружает во вселенную, как не одна игра. Есть спорные моменты в виде крафта, не такого уж и открытого мира, непонятно зачем добавленного , ведь вторая часть игры без него очень хороша. Я советую купить эту игру каждому из Снг, надо же поддержать наших разработчиков,они тягаются с шаблонами и выпускают игру совсем не похожую на то, что нам предлагают сейчас,это похвально!!!!"
670,CashGame,"Feb 27, 2019",10,"It's been a long time since I played a game like this, you are genuinely kept on your feet all the time due to the lack of ammo and the way the mechanics work on some of the weapons that requires you to charge them frequently. Great graphics and artwork that did not get repetitive due to the 4 seasons. The open world was executed well and mixed with the classic linear Metro underground experience from previous games. Encountered 2-3 bugs where the AI would not continue that was resolved with loading the previous checkpoint."

Graphics are nice I give them that. story ok. this is a complete underdeveloped game. not worth the money I spent. the game is worth 30 in my opinion. please fix this game I was waiting for a finally to the series and this is not it."

675,Psiraphim,"Mar 21, 2019",9,"Игра стала очередной жертвой тех игроков, которые легко поддаются модным тенденциям в интернете. Модно ругать Андромеду? Все будем ее ругать. Модно ругать Метро? Будем ругать. Не играл, но осуждаю!Как можно что-то ругать, если ты даже этого не пробовал? Это сразу делает тебя глупым и недалеким человеком.Метро Исход выйдет в стиме. Играйте на здоровье через год, если так хотите. Вам не запретили играть, просто перенесли. Устанавливайте Эпик стор - там скоро Хеви Рейн выйдет.Но нет - надо полностью обругать игру! Это же так модно! Я же такой умный! А игра - классная. За последние пару лет на компьютере вышло много шутеров, но всего парочка достойных. И Метро - лучший из них. Это шутер, которые позволяет проходить не убивая. А если убиваешь - делает это смачно, вкусно и красиво.Кастомизация оружия, САМЫЕ КЛАССНЫЕ КОМПАНЬОНЫ в играх, отличные скриптовые сценки. Игра отлична, если сравнивать с другими последними играми - шедевральна!Главный герой молчит? Специально чтобы вы говорили вместо него!4А - вы молодцы. Я надеюсь на продолжение. Метро Глуховского закончились, есть другие игры этой серии. Делайте ""Муранчу"". Будет классно!"

677,mek,"Apr  1, 2019",10,"This game is badly optimized with a bunch of bugs, face animation is a bit old, the main hero doesn't talk at all but the Post -Apocalypses atmosphere is awesome! The huge amount of dialogs allow you to feel like a part of the Sparta Family. Each stalker has its own problems, dreams, goals, and game show it to you. At begin, I even hate this amount of dialogs but after some time for me was curious to hear more about my teammate. Gameplay is a bit tricky especially on the gamepad, I can't set up comfort sensitivity, so it takes some time to get used to the much lower sensitivity than usual. Missions are really cool, for me was interesting to pass stealth mission by stealth especially if someone asks you about it. The open world isn't so good, but it's not a wonder due to it's the first experience for 4A Games to create it, but still, there is a lot of fun to investigate it. You never know when you will be attacked by monsters(sometimes you can just walk near the river and then from nowhere river monster can attack you), bandits or anomalies(for example Ball lightning which you can find only at night). In general, for me, it's one of the best Post-Apocalipsis game which I played. So, I definitely recommend you to try it. You can watch some of my videos without !!! Spoiler Alert!!! to see some gameplay without spoilers. In general if you fan of Post-Apocalypses games you definitely should try this game. Almost forget about guns. Here you can find a not so many guns but crafting system help you to craft weapon which you will like to use."

683,Artemusic,"Feb 18, 2019",10,"Я купил Метро Исход в магазине  Epic Games, магазин работает отлично довольно удобный. Несогласен со всей критикой в адрес данного магазина и считаю ее сугубо субъективной. Занижение оценки игры из за субъективной ненависти к любым магазина кроме Steam считаю недопустимой. Игра поразила свой детальной проработкой каждой мелочи, каждый герой имеет свой характер, практически в каждом здании, лачуге, канонизации или пещере есть своя история, ""лут"" и какая то другая награда от разработчиков, за исследование мира метро. Невероятная проработка диалогов второстепенных персонажей например:хотел кинуть нож в NPC, но промахнулся и нож воткнулся в стену. Два NPC подошли к ножу и начали его обсуждать. ""О! Что это за нож!?"" ""это не наш!"" ""это точно еретический"" ""Откуда он здесь?"" - в какой игре вы еще такое увидите?основные персонажи проработаны крайне детально у каждого свой характер и своя история порой можно просто часами переезжая от лактации до локации наслаждаться и кайфовать от общения с ними.Гем плей крайне разнообразный за счет того что люди и монстры на разных локация ведут себя по разному и ваш выбор как с ними расправится повлияет на ваше дальнейшее прохождение. Я считаю Метро исход лучшей в серии. Она реально удалось. Я на данный момент уверен увидеть ее игрой года во многих изданиях. Если вы еще сомневаетесь стоит ли покупать, знайте это самый атмосферный шутер в истории игр, который все прохождение будет держать вас в приятном напряжении и волнении за жизнь столь многогранных и душевных героев Метро исход. Хватит всех слушать, покупайте и наслаждайтесь этим шедевром. Моя оценка Максимум из Максимума."

687,VVisemanS,"Feb 28, 2019",4,"Начну с того, что я очень люблю предыдущие 2 игры!Теперь вот, что я хотел бы сказать сказать:1) Графика и проработка мира в игре отличная - тут просто без комментариев. художники постарались на славу.2) Обширные локации с интересным наполнением (постройки, ландшафт).3) Переносной чемоданчик для крафта и сборки оружия для любой ситуаций - очень классное решение! Минусы:1) Артем снова молчит, а ведь к нему не раз обращаются с серьезным разговором. И на фоне всех этих обращений - молчание протагониста выглядит совсем тупо.2) Хоть в игре есть условно ""открытый мир"", но все действия в этих локациях связанны с сюжетом настолько же прямые, как и рельсы по которым едет Аврора. Так же невозможность выбора действия, я считаю идиотским решением - как пример: убедить Мельника взять мать и дочку с собой на уровне Волга.3) Изменение внешности и голоса Артема,Анны и Мельника. Лучше бы оставили как в Last Light - там и голоса приятные и внешность знакомая. Нового Мельника я вообще бы не узнал пока прямо в лоб не сказали - совершенно не похож на себя.Добавьте к этому финальный ролик в плохой концовке в которой есть и Бурбон (которого упоминали в Last Light на уровне ""Павел"", что он выжил) и Хан. Их голоса, ну просто ужасны...4) Некоторые враги при атаке могут пройти/ударить через текстуру. К примеру: демон при налете на меня просто проигнорировал столб контактной сети. Присутствует летающая в воздухе трава и т.п. - одним словом: игре нужны патчи!5) Нелепость сюжета с Ямантау и наивность Мельника - поверить словам министра - хороший полковник. Тут я ловил один фейспалм за другим.6) Локация ""Мертвый город"" - стал для меня отдушиной - ибо в игре под названием Метро, не хватало, как раз таки, метро. Ко всему еще, именно этот уровень я считаю самым лучшим как по атмосферности ужаса, тотальной пустоты в замерзшем городе. Именно этой атмосферы и не хватало всей игре.7) Исследовать уровни надо лишь ради расходников, ибо торговцев с пульками в игре нету. Нет никаких поощрений за исследование - разве что апгрейды для брони. И то - большая часть апгрейдов находится на Волге. В итоге мы имеем игру, которая отстает от Last Light на два шага. Озвучка в игре - ужасна. Игра делалась с закосом на западного игрока. Из всех уровней - зацепил только мертвый город. ИИ у противников туповат. Сюжет - так себе, начало и вовсе тупое. Присутствуют баги и плохая оптимизация. Одним словом - разочарование. Я ожидал от этой игры большего, ибо 20 часов геймплея за 2000 со всем тем, что я описал выше - как то не выкупает себя. Увы, но это однозначно не игра года."

689,technaf,"Feb 19, 2019",8,"If you're a fan of post-apocolyptic settings, games like fallout, half-life 2, or the other metro games, this is definetely a game to get. While it's not a true open world, it comes close enough where there's enough to explore so it feels less linear than the other games in the series. The game has parts that are heavily story driven / ""cutscene"" in nature, though that's expected from the Metro series. I find the major issue of Epic vs Steam is the lack of cloud / synced saves across devices. It's annoying to have to deal with yet another launcher, especially one with issues, though the game itself is good..."

691,Alex_ProQr,"Feb 16, 2019",7,"Слушайте ребят, ну меня игра абсолютно разочаровала! Я не думал, что получу на релизе, такую сырую и кривую игру. Абсолютно идиотские баги, с исчезновением предметов, например ножей и банок, которые проваливаются в небытие прямо у вас на глазах. Баг при разрядке чужого оружия, когда вместо патронов, ты получаешь вместо автомата, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ый дешёвый пистолет, а твой прокачанный калаш просто исчезает вместе со всеми патронами... прыгаешь на землю и начинаешь тонуть (привет Корбен), хотя на этом самом месте растут грибы, трава, лежат камушки. Да и сама текстура прямо говорит: ""Я земля! На меня можно встать!"" Анимации и озвучивание персонажей вообще отдельный разговор. Для русской локализации реализовано всё просто убого. Помню ещё до релиза смотрел ролик от разработчиков, как озвучивали русскую версию игры. Ну думал, всё будет супер. Хрен там! Единственный персонаж, который озвучен в целом аутентично - полковник Мельников ""Мельник"". Для меня выходом стал переход на английский язык с русскими субтитрами. Но всё-равно ужас. Я думаю все заметили, что Артём (к слову говоря главный герой игры), с прошлых частей кроме как кряхтеть при падении/потере крови/получении по морде, не выучил ни одного русского слова! Вы блин издеваетесь? Его комментарий конечно можно услышать перед началом очередного задания, но это ведь совсем не то. Ауу! Розробы! 21 век на дворе!Я конечно поиграл совсем немного, но желания продолжать у меня совершенно нет. Ну по крайней мере пока. Думаю месяцев через 5-6, когда игру хорошенько пропатчат (надеюсь), я всё-же займусь её прохождением. А пока, на полку.P.S. Графика вполне норм, если заткнуть своё внутренне я, которое кричит: ""У тебя 6 ядер по 3.7GGz, nv1080, 16Gb игровая мать и отличный монитор... какого хера чувак?!!"""

The crafting is kinda nice thing i must say.I rather had it on my steam acc then epic but well im not gonna wait a year until i can play it there, but i do not agree with this ""exclusive politics"". Well, over and over it's a decent game 8/10 Played on 1920x1080  at ""extreme"" settings with nice fps, only the desert location was kinda fps dropping and some graphics glitches (sometimes green ""blinks"" when moving camera fast)It's a decent game, but i guess better wait for a sale imho PC Specs:i7-7700GTX 1080ti16gb Ram"

701,Sorean,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Отыграв в игру примерно часов 40 не встретил ни одного бага, ни разу игра не вылетела, на карточке RTX  графика очень даже ничего. Что касается сюжета достаточно захватывающая так как и мафия (1,2). Окружения, озвучка тоже на высоте. Как для отечественного разработчика постарались сделали практически  качественный продукт. Есть проблемы с лицевой анимацией, побочными заданиями, доп заданиями, предсказуемым искусственным интеллектом, сюжетно продюсируемый открытый мир оставляет неоднозначные ощущения (где локации просто кишат монстрами и нпс, а где то реально голая пустошь не сбалансировано). Хотелось бы больше специализированного крафта. Сюжет логичен и закономерен, продолжения должно быть жестоким с лучиком надежды и я уверен что возврат в метро Москвы или путешествие в метро Петербурга, будет неплохим продолжение, а может даже путешествие в другие уголки России, Украины, Белоруссии и других стран пост советского пространства. Спасибо за игру, сделайте работу над ошибками и ждем дальнейших ваших работ."
702,Logarex,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Игра определённо стоит своих денег и времени, чтобы её пройти. Отличная атмосфера, постсоветский антураж, хороший интересный сюжет и, несомненно, жаргонизмы, которые мы слышим в реальной жизни отовсюду. Система прохождения игры сделана очень отлично - сначала тебе дают поиграть стилем W+LMB (беги и стреляй, по нашему), следом ты уже исследуешь локацию, причём делаешь ты это очень долго, и на следующем уровне снова ""беги и стреляй"" и так далее. Лично я был готов пожать руку разработчикам в трёх местах:1. озвучка Креста;2. взаимодействие с твоими напарниками в вагоне во время путешествий;3. мёртвый город. Самая жуткая локация во всей игре.Конечно, любая игра не обходится без минусов. Начнём с них:1. лицевые анимации;2. ничем не выделяющиеся коллекционные предметы (записки и открытки, легко пропустить).За оптимизацию ничего говорить не буду, ибо проходил на PS4 Pro, в связи с чем не сталкивался с вылетами и зависаниями. Один лишь раз фпс просел достаточно сильно, но это было один раз, поэтому не вижу смысла обсуждать это. Да и вообще трудно говорить о плохой или хорошей оптимизации. Были тут товарищи, у одного из которых 1050ti на средних отлично шла, а у кого-то на 1080 игра криво работала. Так же стоит упомянуть крикунов, которые топят за продажи. Якобы Метро Исход продаётся хуже чем новый FarCry: New Dawn. Господа, первые части метро тоже не так быстро разошлись в многомиллионные тиражи. Примерно так же - по 200-300 тыс. копий, как и эта. Так что нужно время. Игра несомненно достойна внимания и прохождения. Пусть даже и на пиратке.Стоит немного сказать про негатив в сторону ""пустого открытого мира"". А вы что хотели? Чтобы в пост-ядерном мире везде были пони, гонки на разбитых уазиках как в Mad Max, такой же треш как и в новом FarCry? Или как в Fallout? От того он и пустой, мир Метро, что была ядерная война, всего 20 лет прошло, люди только-только начали немного осваиваться.Ставлю игре 10/10, чтобы перегнать негативные отзывы. Всем добра ребят."
703,The_Sad_George,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"Прекрасная игра, замечательный сюжет, отличная постановка.Единственный минус игры-это комьюнити нытиков, которое только и делает что сравнивает игру с другими проектами и ровняет её на них(RDR2, GOW и т.д).Много кто жалуется на вылеты, я играл на средних настройках и даже на них игра порой выдавала просто превосходную картинку, особенно когда динамически менялась погода, что касается вылетов, за 35 часов геймплея у меня игра ни единого раза не вылетела, ни ломала сохранения, ни сыпалась квадратами.Самый атмосферный и затягивающий пост-апокалиптичный мир в котором я побывал за последние 10 лет.По факту, оцениваю игру в 8 балов за плохую анимацию диалогов, довольно слабое и местами неуместное, звуковое сопровождение.Но при действительно большом количестве недоработок и шероховатостей, игре хочется простить всё, особенно когда мчишь на ""Авроре"" навстречу неизведанным местам под задушевные разговоры и забористый смех своей команды. Твоей семьи.Спасибо огромное разработчикам за возможность побывать на разлившейся волге, посмотреть на бурлящее изотопами каспийское море, побродить по разросшейся тундре и т.дС нетерпение жду момента когда снова смогу забраться на борт ""Авроры"" и посмотреть к каким приключениям и сюжетным перипетиям в пост-апокалиптичной России она понесёт меня в следующий раз)"

Хотелось бы больше времени провести в метро, походить послушать людей на станциях. Также нет никакой информации о старых персонажей: Хане, Паше, Сухому, Бурбону. Их очень хотелось бы видеть.

708,Nikolay1706,"Feb 17, 2019",7,"В целом игра на семёрочку. Визуальный стиль продолжает радовать глаз. Хороший сюжет, не лучший, звёзд с неба не хватает, но на хорошо тянет. Стрельба как и в прошлых частях игры понравилась. Часть сюжетных миссий откровенно цепляла и оставила исключительно положительные эмоции Из недостатков: стабильность игры, чаще всего вылетала на Волге, позже - не более 2-3 раз, Далее вот прям ярко ощущаемая узость: не хватает вариативности, т.е. явно надо было делать РПГ, т.к. в данной обстановке эта линейность кажется несколько неуместной (возможно я к РПГ привык и поэтому ощущал определённый дискомфорт), а так типо-открытый мир есть, но этого недостаточно. Ну и за продолжительность можно поругать немного. Поэтому могу рекомендовать игру, если не боитесь оказать с прежними правилами в новом мире."
709,Cujo,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"This game reminds me of the greatest titans of the genre: the Half-Life, Bioshock and Deus-Ex series. The climate, the atmosphere is simply unearthly. Many memorable situations. Great narration. A very nice shooting. The only thing I do not like is the silent hero - in other games it is justified, here it is very awkward and unnecessary."
710,NeverLast,"Feb 23, 2019",10,"I hope they will make games like these , is not perfect a loot of glitches and some bugs , but they can be fixed with a patch . game is awesome , story has overwhelmed me , i cry at the end witch i had a good ending i saw on youtube a bad ending and i can say that both are very sentimental powerful . i hope i will play games like these one , because are few companies to make games for gamer's these days ."
711,anirudh6k,"Feb 21, 2019",10,"First 3 hours, this game is amazing.Didnt face many bugs, hopefully those will get ironed out.The low ratings are because of people either not knowing what they expected from a metro game or due to bugs.The game itself feels so good."
712,Changa,"Feb 20, 2019",10,"Now i will critic the game not the platform. Metro exodus have a great story with multiple endings based of your actions from the start until the end unique thing only in metro series. Is a realistic shooter, open world with different type of maps like dessert, arctic, taiga and of course classic metro subway. Many side quest and many stories about different people . Cycle day night, crafting mode with many attachments for your weapon for your style of play. You have a driving mode. But the best things in this game are the atmosphere, the songs the lights and shadows ,the graphics. Amazing game! 10of10 P.S. Don't critic the platform .Critic the game. Developers are not managers."
713,OldGamesFan,"Feb 21, 2019",10,"The game crashes. A lot. And it has bugs. And the performance is bad.And perhaps there are thousand more reasons not to play this game. As kid, I've read ""Roadside picnic""  of the brothers Strugatsky, and I dreamed how I was crawling in the zone, collecting trinkets left behind from alien race. Not surprisingly years later I've became Stalker and Metro fan. And this is what Metro Exodus is about. You know this feeling, don't you? Eyes at four. Listening to the surroundings. The phobia that something is behind your back, that makes you turn over and over. Counting your last bullets, while exploring around, hoping that you will find something that is still useful after all the years that have passed. And the atmosphere... Abandoned buildings that make your skin crawl, mutated beasts howls, old vehicles eaten by rust, equipment that my grand father was working with... And add a nice story to it, with many interactions between the characters. If your system can run it, I strongly recommend to give it a try."
714,WarBow69,"Feb 21, 2019",10,"Awesome job Metro team! I want more and I’m really looking forward to even a bigger open world and more surprise to come. I really enjoyed the open world, weapon/armor/accessories upgrades, building up the train base, the story line and day/night level of intensity. I never had any crashes on the PC like a lot of negative reviews are saying. So far my Epic gaming experience has been enjoyable."

Атмосфера так же чувствуется очень сильно, игра держит в напряжение и заставляет переживать за каждого персонажа.Спасибо Вам 4A Games за такой проект как Метро(про игровую часть и не писателя).То что игра вышла в Epic Games Store, мне никак не помешала в ее покупке, те кто хотел купить игру купили и спокойно играют просачиваясь этой атмосферой и поддержкой авторов."

718,SeijiNakamura,"Feb 23, 2019",6,"Не понравилось что в игре нету гибкой настройки графики, а только готовые пресеты.Не возможно полностью отключить размытие в движении.Так же отсутствует нормальное сохранение слотом, а не это быстрое что есть в игре.Очень сильные просадки FPS при системе - 8700K+1080+16GB, могли бы сделать функцию чтоб можно было лочить FPS раз не смогли в оптимизацию.Иногда есть баг что нельзя убить или оглушить противника.Иногда попадаются монстры застрявшие в текстурах.В первые две игры не играл, но вот молчание Артёма напрягает, если ему что-то говорят или спрашивают, после этого бывает пауза и складывается ощущение что Артём должен бы ответить, но он просто стоит и молчит."
719,RR3307,"Mar  8, 2019",6,"Contains minor spoiler about game mechanics but not the story(So the box for spoilers was not checked...), you have been warned ;) What a grate franchise made into something predictable and like every thing else. It makes for a good S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game, just not a good Metro game.The games loss of identity is contributed to the opening of the games world into a semi-open one and it also has a  number of bugs and bad collision (It has enough bugs for a rain forest). Cramped spaces, dirt, supernatural and darkness are the things that made this game great and that is what was lost here (with some exceptions...)When you went outside in the last two games, you had a realization that you are not on the top of the food chain, that this place is inhospitable and dangerous and that the radiation and natures new predators will inevitably make you crawl back into the darkness of the metro! It was beautiful!This is all lost now since there is no more radiation, your choices dont matter since if you **** up, you can run away and your mistakes are forgiven and forgotten, making the game easier and more forgiving.Also, who asked for the crafting, the big part of the game is scarcity, making you decide if you want to fight or try to sneak trough (especially on the hardest difficulty where you need to count the bullets to try to keep the track and this makes you play the game the way it was made to be played)Also, the pre-war bullets were a great compromise between having an edge in the fight and buying gear. It was in your risk since the places that had a shop were few and far in between...There are a few places that feel like a true metro game, namely the start, the end and a few places like the spider tunnel and the hydro dam. In the spider tunnels you have the fire ammo for tikar and that makes the level to easy. People who loved Metro series for its unique elements will not find them in this one. Also, Casoian sea map has a game breaking bug and the tech support asks you to start the chapter from the start so good luck if you went trough the entire map before doing this part. This is not PC exclusive problem...Supernatural themes are almost non existent.Also the irony of having the bad ending be the more interesting one and the one with the true nature of the game... The good one was ok, just not as good...This is truly a sad story of a great idea destroyed by the people who seem not to understand what made their games great! This review did not look into the thing with epic and did not contribute to the score. This is not a 4A problem. It was a Deep Silver choice and the game will not be punished for that..."

Данная часть является отличной продолжательницей предыдущих игр и даже превосходит их.Но помимо этого, в игре есть недостатки. Игра мне показалась короткой, хотя я буквально исследовал каждый дом. К минусам можно добавить еще и малое количество дополнительных миссий. На дворе уже 2019 год, но Артем до сих пор остался немым. Это немного портит погружение в игру и ее атмосферу, но не так критично.В целом игра получилась добротная, советую к приобретению.Жаль, что игре снижают рейтинг, она того явно не заслуживает. Ставить отрицательные оценки из-за перехода в другой магазин - очень глупо. Не является ли это оправданием пиратства?"

Разработчикам за такое надо головы снести, чтобы чувствовали границы.Предыдущие игры тоже полны таких отклонений на Россию. 4A Games ведь украинцы, да ещё, как оказалось, ярые фанатики майдана. Такую же оценку ставлю 'интеллекту' тех овощей, которые в упор не замечают этого около-политического мусора под носом и игнорят дурно пахнущего слона в комнате. На историю со Стимом и Эпик Стором мне лично всё равно.

At the moment, at top performance PC this game runs with some freezes but I think it will be fixed in near future. Hope that you are all try this masterpiece of postapocalyptic reality, it's worth it, I garantee.."
731,SeriousLie,"Feb 19, 2019",10,"-Gorgeous game, technically and in its art direction. The world feels alive, the lighting (Didn't try with Raytracing as i don't own an RTX card) is probably the best you'll see in any game right now. Visually, a very very solid game, it simply is gorgeous. -Gameplay is very good overall. The game loop relies heavily on resource management, especially in higher difficulty (special note for the ranger difficulty not being a DLC this time around. Which is, in my opinion, the way the game must be played with minimal hud. Even if I would recommend the hard difficulty for a 1st playthrough). You have two resources in the game, chemicals and scraps, you use them to craft consumables and ammo mostly but also to take care of your weapons and repair your equipment. for example, you need to clean your guns regularly, otherwise, they will get dirty and jam often and they will be less efficient (less damage, reduced stability etc...). That's where the game pushes you to go and explore the levels/chapters rather than just going for the main objective. On lower difficulties, it will not be a problem, but on higher ones, you will find yourself having a very hard time in certain situations because you may be out of ammo or don't have a Molotov, or you gasmask is broken and you can't repair it. So, you explore the world to find scraps and chemicals to be prepared for what lies ahead and along the way you will find a few side objectives, secrets, stories, etc... Other than that, the gunplay feels good, combat situations and enemies are varied, the camp and crafting is simple and works perfectly, the weapon customisation is awesome and the level design are overall very good. -The story is good, even very good at some points. The game is separated in a number of chapters each in their own setting and with their own stories while following the game main story. Meaning that you will go through each level following Artyom&co story all while discovering the stories that the place you're currently in holds all while making choices that may not seem important, but will impact the places you're at in the short term AND Artyom's story in the long run. And that's where the story shines in my opinion. Artyom's story is not bad at all but there's nothing to cry about here, it's good. On the other hand, the stories of the people you will meet, to see how different parts of the world evolved after the war etc... is superb. I don't want to say too much as this is something to be experienced without warnings. But it's one of those games that feels very rewarding for those who pay attention and take the time to explore and discover. But also one that actually conveys a message to you and tries to tell something. -Sound design is ok, one of the weakest part of the game in my opinion. A lot of sounds are back from 2033 and Last light. And a lot of them really needed to change but did not, (the walking sound when you are not used to it can be... annoying) a shame but nothing that will stop you. The soundtrack is quite good on the other hand... -The AI is mediocre, It sometimes works just as intended and sometimes not. I found myself in a lot of cases where i got seen through walls by enemies or some of them just do not react during gunfights when I'm in front of them. A shame, at least their voiceovers do a good job (My 1st playthrough was in English dub and 2nd in Russian) at making you feel like they are a human being with believable reactions. Even if the acting (in english, can't really judge for russian) is sometimes a bit weird. Overall a great game, one the best FPS and even narrative game I would say of the past few years. Objectively I believe this game deserves an 8/10 because of the bugs (most of them are minor, but some are not), technical issues (the game run fine for me at 60fps 1080p with dips to 40fps at two points in the game at high settings on a gtx 1070; i7-6700k; 16ggbRAM; latest drivers, Win10), not so great voice acting, etc...But this game deserves more, and seeing people **** on it because of the Epic exclusivity makes me sad. In the end what matters is the game, and here we have a great game."
732,EasternUNO,"Feb 21, 2019",8,"After finishing the game on my RTX 2080 Ti I would give this game 80/100 points. When I was playing the game, it somehow reminded me Half Life series because of the environment where the game takes part in. You are doing many things on your own, the main character Artyom is not speaking as well as Gordon Freeman etc. This game also have a mechanics of The Last of Us, where you are saving your ammo, you can craft some stuff or adjust your equipment if you found enough raw materials on the maps. I like that this game is not only in underground and you can see the world full of mutants, soldiers and other beasts. Let me come up with some goods and bads for this game: Pros:-Great story-Very realistic characters who were speaking all the time to you and I had no feeling that there is some broken record speaking-Stunning graphics-Ray tracing and DLSS support Cons:-Poor performance optimisation-No SLI support-DLSS on 3440x1440 resolution was very blurry-I was playing half of the game with a bug, where Artyom's hand was completely invisible, so when you was holding a gun, it was levitating on your screen as well as other things what you had in your hands. Performance tips:-If you are owner of RTX graphic cards and you decide to use ray tracing, use High setting instead of Ultra, You will get solid 10 - 20% performance boost with almost no quality loss.-Do not use DLSS for lower resolution than 4K is. Even not for 3440x1440, it's not worth of some performance improvement. The image quality looks same as if you will set up resolution scaling to 60%. -For all of the users you will get like +15% performance improvement if you will lower your graphical settings from Extreme to Ultra. -I recommend you to turn off Tesselation. It will give you next +15% performance boost. - Try not to change Shading rate. It will dramatically improve your performance but it will cost you a loss of image quality. I did not even understand why is it called shading rate, as for me the shadows were looking the same no matter what settings i will use. But if you will lower the value, the image will become more blurry, so I think it's resolution scale modifier. Enjoy!"
733,dasha_p,"Feb 21, 2019",9,"The game is for me a solid 7, however the '0' and '1' rating are complete uncalled for and aren't constructive. It is unfortunate that we now have to seek to 'balance' votes because certain people aren't mature enough to review something for what it is rather than to undercut the people/companies behind it."

735,ChosenOne,"Mar 24, 2019",8,"Диалоги в игре реализованы на неприлично низком уровне (сам текст, актёрская игра и синхронизация с игровой анимацией). Да и вообще в игре довольно много ""шероховатостей"". Но в целом получился шедевр! Немного напомнила мне half-life 2."
736,Slyguyi69,"Mar 17, 2019",8,"Well being they didn't sell this title on Steam I was hesitant to purchase it. But my thirst for a new game gave way and I bought it. I've never been a big fan of the Metro franchise but I've got to admit this game was entertaining and fun. I'm a story game oriented player and games that kind of read like a book as this one does are my genre. Very rich story content and the NPC's go on for days with dialogue it seems in between levels. Sometimes it gets annoying because you can't ESC out of it and move on and are forced to actually go with the story. Not a bad thing but to some it may annoy them to death. The gameplay was entertaining and the background on the story was quite interesting. The levels were full of challenge and the weapons were quite interesting and cool. The only thing I would have changed was the whole ""cleaning"" your weapon all the time as it took a lot away from the game. Weapons don't require that much cleaning to stay accurate and powerful especially powerful. The other part I wasn't thrilled with was the having to make ammo and collect it all the time and seem to run out and opportune times. Beyond that the crafting system was good with the mods you could do with all the weapons. The NPC's were challenging and the surprise factors on many of the levels. Overall it was a good 10 hours of play and interesting to keep me wanting to finish it. The save system is garbage and if you use the GeForce launcher then you must remain using it as the Epic launcher wont see the save game files kept in the GeForce folder.Worth the purchase if my opinion, game was done fairly well even though it's still the Unreal 2 engine. Would love to see a new engine finally come out and refine some of the graphics but companies use the old goto Unreal 2. Grab it if you're bored and want to have a good story FPS game!"
737,CristianLycan,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"I love the Metro post-apocalyptic universe. I played the first games and read the books. The game is great and the franchise is awesome. The atmosphere is there even though it had a more western vibe than the previous 2 games. My favorite parts were the beginning and the end with the nuclear winter cities. The middle one with the Caspian sand did not sit well since it looks more like Mad Max. I would give it an 8.5 because the game became an Epic store exclusive 2 weeks before release but that didn't stop me from buying it. I have a good PC and it ran well and had some crashes but that was because of over-clocks that I had to disable. I noticed maybe 1 or 2 animation bugs but nothing a quick reload couldn't solve. After finishing the game I felt like I was lost and didn't know what to do anymore because I wanted more. More of the story, lore and characters.More of Metro !"
738,BlakeArius,"Mar 10, 2019",8,"You can't please everyone with any kind of review of this game but here goes.My Thoughts:-The game is solid, I like the storytelling, gunplay, graphics, sound and pacing. It reminds me of stalker. Stealth emphasis can feel dull though.-I think some elements and the open world are a bit redundant in some parts.-Experienced some floating enemies but no major bugs.-Epic store is terrible.. but after seeing the work offices in Ukraine, taking a bigger cut of profit seems understandable. Still there interactions with the community have been terrible and short sighted. I can understand the outrage culture around this game.. but I still think it's a good shooter worth your time and AAA output from a studio running on bits of cardboard and spit."

741,AlexBLR,"Feb 25, 2019",10,"Чувствуется довольно ранний выход, возможно стоило сделать бета-тест, и вот почему:Сюжет - он короткий и линейный. Ты движешься только вперед.Доп. задания есть да, но от них вообще ничего не зависит, никак не влияет ни на что. Нет отклика ни от персонажей ни от игрового мира.Сходи убей там время - всё. Ну да, снарягу хорошую там найдешь это приятно. Неприятно что твои действия не имеют смысла.Я ждал что спасение адептов культа рыбы даст какой-то итог в концовке, что бандиты будут внезапно нападать и строить засады,но нет они просто сидят по углам. Тоже самое с рабами нефтяников, и с переростками летнего лагеря, которых просили сильно не кромсать.Нет какой-либо спонтанности, что там тебя выслеживают, или залез не в ту дыру а там медведь, или вот те же демоны.Я в гнездо залез, демонят почикал, игрушку забрал. Я ждал что меня отчихвостят прямо там, что будут преследовать до поезда,что наконец-то демон нападет на поезд в пути, и...ничего. Вообще не нападали, чуть более чем никогда.Живность игрового мира - она слабая, глупая да и вообще вся на скриптах.В первых двух частях игра хоть и была коридорная, но там было хорошее повествование, продуманные уровни и вариации действий.Тут этого нет, либо совсем не проработано. Тот же касяк с системой апгрейдов, она по наклонной вверх всегда. Нет такого чтобы я должен был резко перебрать стволы и снарягу,или осознать провал неправильно подобранных стволов и надвигающийся абзац. Просто вот иди вперед и пушки будут круче.Ребят да это целиком опустило всю грандиозность задумки сборных стволов. Открытость мира не чувствуется вот совсем. Да локация большая, но ты в ней словно жук в банке, смысл куда-то идти есть, но толку?Это ничего не изменит, да может там найдешь какие-то крохи вроде документов, снаряги, но и только.Не менее доставляют переезды в 2000 км, в 4000 км и т.д. А что вы делали все это время?Может надо дозаправится? Еды, угля добыть? В процессе этого найти себе проблем/союзников?Просто - нет, давайте все промотаем. Меня до конца игры не отпускало что это все крутейший пролог,и вот я сам буду решать куда двигаться и что делать,что наконец-то смогу посетить менее зараженные города поискать там выживших в тамошнем метро,вернуться в Москву и там поведать правду,заехать в пару секретных бункеров просто побродить либо в полном экшене с каннибалами,либо как в Новосибирске, отбиваясь от мутантов/пауков и гадя тоннами кирпичей,ан нет, просто показали титры. Это было слишком больно. Повествование, тесная и душевная связь героев,умение заставить сопереживать/испытывать страх,реально передали сумашествие и хаос происходящего - за это 10 и 10 и за всю серию в целом.Делайте вы серию Dead Space, народу бы много в психушку поехало."
742,Zo0mko,"Feb 25, 2019",9,"Изначально скептически относился к игре из-за общественного порицания игры и ситуации с политическими отсылками в ней, но с первых же секунд геймплея настолько проникся атмосферой игры, что не отпускала она меня несколько дней, именно столько понадобилось на то, чтобы пройти её полностью. И в этом как раз главный её недостаток. Она оказалась слишком короткой. Настолько, что я аж в небольшую депрессию впал после её конца. Очень жаль, что эта прекрасная игра, заставившая меня почувствовать то, что я уже давно не чувствовал во время прохождения современных игр, так быстро и скомканно завершилась."
743,aitakaitov,"Feb 25, 2019",9,"I really enjoyed playing this game. I don't get people who call it ""Russophobic"" - which in my opinion is **** - or give it bad reviews because of Epic Store. Your typical Metro-like atmosphere with dark, damp places and claustrophobic tunnels is still there, surprisingly even though the game has moved to an open-world model. I found the freedom the game gives you as just the right amount - unlike Far Cry 5 where I felt like I had no sense of purpose, this game gives me enough freedom to enjoy it and not to lose the sense of direction. The game could be optimized better - I assume that that's coming with patches, the dialogues sometimes have bad timing, and you can see the tiny time inaccuracies in scripting and character movement while speaking, but not an important thing I believe. The crafting system is great since you are not limited in terms of weapons modifications and some types of ammo. Weapons variety is sufficient, but there are clearly ones that are better than the others. Story-wise, it's good - the narrative is dynamic, not boring, everything you do has a sense of purpose. I had a great time just walking around the train between areas and talking and drinking with everyone. Many games could take some notes from this game, in terms of narrative and story. The characters are likable, act according to their role and are relatable. I've enjoyed the game all the way from the beginning to the end and probably will be replaying it. The ""console port"" comments are unfounded - the controls are very good, and even though I usually play R6 Siege and other FPS games, I liked the controls a lot. I would put it between The Witcher 3 - my favorite game of all time - and Borderlands 2 - my 3rd favorite game of all time - which I would consider fairly high. Giving it a 9/10 just because of some problems technical in nature, but I would call it almost a must play. Just for the record:Ryzen 5 1600 @4.0MSI R9 39016GB DDR4 @3000 Considering the fact, that the graphics card is not anything new and I was playing comfortably with FreeSync on 50-60FPS at High, lowering the settings to Medium should do the trick. I haven't noticed big performance differences between Ultra, High, and Medium, so just keep that in mind."
744,KOHb,"Feb 26, 2019",10,"Yes, the gameplay with the open world were not so strong, but for such a presentation of the plot and for such colorful characters, I forgive this game everything. The atmosphere at the highest level, in addition, almost everyone who lives in the countries of the former Soviet Union has a craving for post-Soviet post-Apocalypse. And here it is perfectly conveyed, it is difficult to describe the emotions experienced by the entourage of old houses, churches, carpets on the walls and the old Aurora locomotive. First, the plot is intriguing and interesting, and in the end so exciting that you feel like the main character walks on the blade and can only hope that the story will find its happy end.P.S.

Не испытывал никогда никаких проблем с ресурсами, а хотелось бы. Проходил на сложности ""Рейнджер-Хардкор"", и просто наслаждался ею.

749,dmcglone,"Mar 16, 2019",8,"I've played Metro from the first up through Exodus, and overall, Metro Exodus is the best in the series.  The two big map types with actual freelance play are water and desert.  Forest and ice are heavily scripted, which unfortunately ruins some of the games nostalgia, being that the game begins with water and desert maps that allow free roaming capabilities, yet those capabilities are taken away halfway through the game.  All that work searching for equipment upgrades doesn't seem to pay off.  I felt as if the developers finished Volga map and Caspian Sea map, and lost sight of some of their vision in Tiaga map, and then all of it in Dead City map (which was fun to play nevertheless)  It's like a game that wants to be somewhat open-world in the beginning, but turns out to be something heavily scripted and takes away open-world altogether.  Done make me mad!  And it don't make no sense! However, overall, it is entertaining and fun for a single play through.  The important thing about Metro: Exodus is that it shows to us the consumer that the company is ready to move forward to what we've all been waiting for: an open-world single-player Metro experience.  I would pay $100 USD for such an experience!"
750,Boomgunner,"Mar 20, 2019",10,"For me, as a person who lives in Russia, this is simply a masterpiece. The atmosphere of the game at the highest level. At first I was playing the game on easy difficulty, but it was a mistake. On hardcore, the game just transforms, it becomes more interesting to play. Of course, the game is not without problems, but for the studio, which is located on the territory of the former USSR, this is a great job. Thanks to Dmitry Glukhovsky, thanks to the studio. I will definitely replay it. As soon as the new part comes out, I will buy it without thinking. Thx 4e Games!!!!"

Before metro exodus I finished Shadow of the Tomb Raider and I was astouned by its graphics but then metro came in and blew me even more. Secondly, atmosphere. Omg it's just pouring out of the screen. No vr needed to feel as if one was in this postapocaliptic world. Story - very very good. I would have given 10 if it was not for a major bug i.e. greyed out  blacks and I mean totally greyed out. Even during day time. Fixed it only by changing gamma in config file but it took me some time to find this tip on the Internet. Apart from that totally worth playing."

755,Bynke,"Feb 15, 2019",7,"Honestly my biggest cockblock still for this game is the Epic games launcher, but when that has been said. The game itself has whole lot of content to it and indeed rewards the OG players of the previous titles, when it comes to looting and gaining new weapon mods etc. It is clear that the new open world style takes a bit of time to get used to, and will definetly turn off a portion of players. But the open world leaves areas not nessecary to explore, optional when it comes to progression, which sort of compares to previous games, though brought to a whole new level in size and i like that. But even running the game on a really high end gaming rig, at max graphics will hurt your fps counter badly, not so much in the first ""act"" or area, but in the dessert ""act"" in daytime the particles effects & other settings can almost render combat laughable (framedrops to 20 fps occurs). It needs to be fixed or optimiced at least. I've now spent about 10 hours ingame, and not considering the somewhat different graphical settings needed for preformance, the game itself has plenty of moments that reminds of the mood and setting, being claustrophobic in the tunnels of Moscow metro. So all in all, I can live with heaving to tweak minor settings for optimization but this is a bit of a mouthfull, anyways i would reccomend the game to the fans of the series, but to the newcommers, that hasn't played the other titles, they might not aprecciate some aspects of the game, like the lore.And honestly im still going to add this game to my steam libary when the time is right, this fortnite launcher, is just not my thang.Sorry for the rusty english, but hope i still cleared some things up."

762,Gucifer,"Mar  4, 2019",9,"What happens when an excellent game becomes mired in controversy? The result is something like this mixed metascore rating as well as the myriad of review bombs on steam. What's unfortunate here is that while the sudden shift from Steam to Epic games does warrant some push back, this backlash might do more bad than good in the long run. Metro Exodus is a single player survival horror shooter  with light rpg elements that carries with it no monetization schemes, no gear grinding, and is completely story driven. There is no season pass or micro transactions. Everything that the devs have crafted is given to you from the first and only $60 purchase. This alone warrants praise at a time where every AAA title is perverted by shady monetization schemes levied by greedy publishers. Community opposition is invaluable when facing the like of Electronic Arts, who's stock continues to plummet due to horrendous corporate practices such as release deadlines and pay to win economies. 4a on the other hand is a relatively small studio with only 150 employees that is trying to make it's mark on the gaming industry through emphasizing single player titles that are atmospheric and experimental. Metro Exodus is no exception. While not perfect and falling short of the many Sony first party studio titles, Metro Exodus is an excellent single player title that expands it's claustrophobic interior levels to the open expanse of Russia while retaining the oppressive atmosphere that has characterized this series. Presentation: Currently the best looking title in the market. From detailed character animations, excellent texture rendering, a multitude of weather effects which substantially changes gameplay, to lived in environments that have been meticulously and lovingly crafted by the devs, this game features some of the best post- apocalyptic environments ever conceived. Gameplay: While excellent, the desolate and grim environments are only as good as the creatures that populate them. And, like the environments, the radiated creatures add an insurmountable amount of fright and terror when exploring the world (most particularly the Volga when encountering watchmen and shrimp with limited to no ammunition). Within the open expanse of the Volga and the Caspian desert I would avoid encountering creatures as much as possible due to their ability to absorb bullets while I yield no reward for their death. The human enemies on the other hand I would always engage with gladly in order to collect gear and supplies. Overall enemy types are diverse and warrant different combat tactics in order to be dealt with swiftly. The core combat is fairly straightforward and rudimentary. You have ranged and close ranged stealth combat or can go guns blazing in a matter that is not all that different from Far Cry. Though what gives Metro an extra punch is it's customization depth. Pick up any gun and you can transform a magnum into a sniper by adding a scope, long barrel and a wooden stock. Don't care for the stock assault, shotgun, and pistol classes that are offered? Try the railway gun which carries a variety of ammo including inferno. The ability to transform every conceivable portion of a weapon to fit your specifications makes every engagement exciting and novel. Furthermore, since ammo is sparse, Metro rarely plays like Far Cry and every encounter can very well be your last. It is highly recommended that skilled players ramp up their playthrough difficulty to hard. This truly allows players to test their survival skills and is highly rewarding. My only complaint is a boss fight in the Taiga region that players have to endure twice. It is essentially a bullet sponge with an exceptionally long reach that bogs down the progression of the story while simultaneously causing you to waste all the munitions you've gathered, leaving you nothing for Novosibirsk. Other than that, it's excellent. Each region presents a different challenge. Novosibirsk is particularly frightening and disorienting, offering some of the most tense and sweat inducing levels ever conceived. Story: This is both the strongest and weakest element of Exodus. It begins with a bang with Artyom still in Moscow attempting to find life outside the metro. Once certain essential plot points unveil themselves in the first hour or two, a plethora of narrative potential could have been tapped into which, instead, is traded for all the cliched staples of a post-apocalyptic game. From religious cults to cannibals, any attempt to thwart or subvert the expected post apocalyptic formula is immediately relinquished in favor of survivor horror oriented conflicts. Furthermore, because much of the horror in Metro is dependent on isolation and desolation, players do not have many opportunities to interact with characters outside the the Aurora train, which grants little room for individual characterization. Ultimately an excellent game that is well worth your time!"

A stealth approach exists for many situations and it is rewarding. It's been a while since I've met a good FPS and I'm really happy for this one."
767,Loac,"Mar  9, 2019",5,"Графика и оптимизация на высоте. Даже на моем стареньком компьютере игра вполне сносно работала на средних настройках. Но вот все остальное удручает. Я уже говорил тебе, что такое безумие? Все персонажи в игре сумасшедшие. Командиры в московском метро. На Волге сумасшедший культ. Обезумевший Мельник, который постоянно рассказывает об оккупантах. Бункер Ямантау, это вообще лютейший фейспалм. Каспий – очередные рабовладельцы. В Тайге опять безумные лесные братья, которые следуют какому-то кодексу неведомого Учителя. Сумасшедший капитан, который живет с трупами. Что это, почему в игре столько душевнобольных? Выбор – совершить плохой или добрый поступок всегда настолько очевидно, что становится скучно. Стелс – его практически нет. Ждешь ночи и практически на марше проходишь мимо всей охраны. Бой – также все грустно. Из-за дефицита боеприпасов всегда приходится экономить и стараться из кустов ваншотить противника. А поскольку в этом мире тупые все, то просто ждешь момента, когда супостат высунется из-за угла и с криком «Я тебя сейчас порешу», подставит под маслину свой деревянный лоб. Крафт – сбор всякого хлама немного мотивирует на исследование локаций, но в целом бесполезен. Диалоги – откровенная нудятина. Раскрытие персонажей через диалоги, это чудесно, но не так же топорно. Я честно выслушал большенство рассказов. Да, иногда они были забавными, но это не спасает ситуацию в целом. Если не хотели разбавлять геймплей системой диалогов, можно было бы сделать переговоры по рации, где персонажи общались бы между собой, пока ГГ находится на вылазке. Хочешь слушать – включаешь рацию, хочешь насладиться одиночеством – выключаешь. Очень трудно сопереживать своим напарникам, так как нет никакого взаимодействия с ними. Кое как налажен контакт только с Анной, которую можно немного пожамкать в купе, выслушивая ее душевные излияния. Радиация – я понимаю, что это игровая условность, но создается впечатление, что она вообще не несет никакой опасности. Делаешь себе инъекцию витаминок и ты снова здоров как бык. Ржал в голос, когда Мельник получив запредельную дозу радиации и приснившись Артему, просил похоронить его под деревом в их новом доме. Да, Батя, у тебя фон как после взрыва ядерной бомбы, а ты хочешь, чтобы тебя похоронили рядом с людьми. Баги – они везде, они повсюду. Летающие предметы и НПС, бессметные враги, зависающие скрипты и вылеты самой игры. Как итог, игра – твердый середнячок на одно прохождение. Последняя локация проходилась вообще наскоком, все это уже было – монстры, горы трупов и снег. Было очевидно, что это финал и никакого афтерплей не будет. Также ничего не указывало на какую-то эпичную развязку, так что хотелось просто поскорее закончить."
768,Cuui,"Feb  2, 2020",0,"This game is a broken piece of ****  Which is really sad and disappointing because the last one was so good.  I really think they withdrew it from Steam because they knew the immediate reviews would kill sales.  Actually, the fact that people have come to metacritic to bomb it just for not being on steam has actually helped them because it masks the legitimate reviews that expose how bad this piece of garbage is. It's like they wanted to get the fan market of other genres like open world, crafting, zombies and threw it all in the game but didn't do any of it right.  The zombie models are the most uninspired, pathetic character models I've ever seen in an AAA title.  Picking up a random brick that isn't around and hucking it?  Is this SNES?  The lame ass moving from shed to shed through the open world has been done so much better by other titles and in this game kind of left you asking why they even attempted the open world in the first place, cause you're constantly being tunneled.  That same stupid thing they had going on in the last one where if you fell in water you'd either come back up or get killed by a monster is done so poorly here too it's maddening.  It's often ambiguous as to whether or not you're jumping onto land or water.  The crafting is so **** they should have just stuck to weapon modifications and avoided the tediousness of picking everything up when what you can actually do with it is quite limited. Then there's the performance issues.  The game looks good, but it hitches like **** crazy.  It's not even low FPS, it just staggers and stutters all over the place making gunplay infuriating whereas in the previous entries it was fun.  The AI is **** retarded, what they do makes no sense.  But because the movement system is so bad and **** up from the hitching and general **** animations it's hugely difficult to kill them.  And I'm an avid FPSer. The save system overwrites quick-saves with auto saves.  Did you hear that?  So you quick-save in a safe place and then the game overwrites that with an autosave wherein you're getting killed.  So then you have to reload the whole level. Several times within the first minutes of playing bodies were getting stuck in walls/objects and bouncing around.  You can't cancel animations or cutscenes.  So if you pick something up and the game goes into cutscene sequence of you looking at it but you're being attacked, you're ****  You can't get out of it. The game is a **** wreck.  I think a lot of the positive reviews are fake, Deep Silver knew they would never survive legitimate Steam reviews but they can make it less clear here by pumping in fake reviews on metacritic. You **** up an amazing game, bros.  Never been so disappointed in a title.  Glad I got it on sale."
769,Eikox,"Mar  8, 2019",7,"SHORT CRITIC: Is a good game with a decent adaptation of the continuation of the saga Metro. Nothing else.LONG CRITIC: The story is good however the voice acting somehow destroy the inmersion in this new world. The details are really good, scenes marvelous and carry the fantasy of survive in a open post apocaliptic russian world make you being always suspicious. At the end in other words you make and feel a great progress, stunning moments aaaand its gone. The ending could be presented in a better way, leaving you with a taste of ""Ok I finish it, now what?"""

""critics"" nowadays are on drugs or something.."
771,Johnysh,"Feb 27, 2019",7,"It's good game... but not the best Metro game. I player every Metro game. 2033 is my favourite and I also read the books. -Gunplay is amazing, great upgrade.-Crafting and backpack system... it works but... I didn't know how to open backpack until like 2nd half of the game. Why I didn't know about it? Because nobody told me and before Autumn level I really didn't need it. And I think that's a problem. And also problem is that this is console port and you have to HOLD ""i"" to open the backpack.... you f-ing kidding me? At one time I thought about how do I open the backpack, I pressed every button but nothing worked so I ignored it until Autumn level where you could say it's very usable.-UI and controlls are a bit confusing because they are different than in previous Metro games-the rest of gameplay aspects... probably works because I can't think of any other problems or very well made mechanics that would be nice to mention -soundtrack is great, nothing bad to say about it-audio... sometimes it's missing, sometimes it cuts... there are sounds used from previous games and you can hear their old age, but some new audio is well made, that Dolby thingie is also pretty good-voice acting isn't bad, but nothing really amazing... voice doesn't change because of position of the character (character is turned away from you, he's close to you etc.) also sometimes it just doesn't fit to animation the character is in (Anna was talking or maybe she was yelling at Miller facing him, then she turned around, went to you and started to show signs of dissapointment but her voice was still same, characters are speaking over each other) -graphics are just beautiful, there's nothing bad to say about it. -optimization...is pretty good. Sometimes long loadings, then there are bugs (I got stuck in crawling animation, I could crawl through walls, beneath the map and I couldn't stop it so reload, then some minor bugs) I had pretty good amount of crashes... first two were in game and the rest (4 or 5) were when I was quiting the game. -story... the beginning is rushed. The ending is rushed. The open world doesn't help it. The game is no longer dense. You are not in contact with the story all the time. The true Metro feeling is in only one location which was just perfect.-characters are pretty well made. But they can't stop talking. This is the only game where I wished that Artyom could talk because listening to everyone talking for minutes without some reaction and just standing and watching them... it's boring. Very boring.-also because of the rushed beginning I noticed some people from the crew for the first time after 1. or 2. big location. I didn't know about guy called Idiot until Summer location. I was just surprised where was he all the time.-also... it's pretty dissapointing...look: In Last Light for example your main goal changes. It's like doing multiple mainquests. In Exodus it's just one mainquest. You start off with one goal which doesn't change the whole time and once you get to the end... well actually... you don't get to the end. The cutscene will take you to the end. now the main flaw: The open world It breaks the story. Game is no longer dense. There are parts where you just don't feel like you are part of the story. You are just there to explore because why not.The areas are also... different. They have different combinations of story and open world.First open winter location is perfect mix between open world and story.Summer location is bad combination. It's big open world with small parts of story and my least favourite. The atmosphere is no longer dense, it feels too open, no intense moments.Third ""open"" location isn't very open but also it's not very linear... and it doesn't have a lot of story. Like last  10-20minutes are good but until then it's weak.And the fourth location...that's the true Metro experience. I'll say no more about it because lot of people probably don't know what locations this is. This just looks like experimenting. Finding out what's good combination what's not. In previous Metro games you felt like you are still in contact with the story. With some small breaks to buy ammo. It felt like it's 50% of gameplay and 50% of the story hand in hand, working together very well. Perfectly balanced as all things should be. In Exodus it's like splitting them apart with 70% of gameplay and 30% of the story. It's weak, atmosphere is almost gone, almost no dense moments If I should compare the locations and story:openworld... It's like walking from Witcher 3 to Skyrim to almost linear game with small amount of story (I can't really think of game like that) to Metro game. Let's wrap it up Metro Exodus is first Metro game which made me wanting more from it. It didn't fill me up completely even though it's even longer than previous games. But those were perfect. I felt full, like after a good meal. But not with Exodus."
772,Dracen,"Feb 20, 2019",6,"I want to love this game more than I did, and perhaps my expectations is what made the game so boring for me.  The truth is it is an 'open world lite' game with little reason to explore the map, save for a small chunk of locations.  You will also find yourself caught on scenery too often, and the gun play is poor.  ""spoiler alert""  Ammo management is rough for open world, since for some reason ammo is not held on the train you get early on.  Story is great in my opinion, but I'm not sure the amount of time it took to beat the game was worth the money spent, especially since the time is padded by trying to go back to deal with bugs or game crashes.  Overall, however, I would say the game is 'not bad' but $50 to $60 is a bit steep.  I would wait for a sale, and steam support."

774,MrSoupp45,"Feb 22, 2019",7,"The game has a fantastic story and delves into the despair of the Metro world. The gameplay is quick and smooth. However, there is room for improvements. The first thing I noticed, as soon as I started playing the game, I came across many glitches that took the immersion and stomped on it. Yes, the game has just come out, however, I found that even for a new release, that there were so many glitches, mainly saves problems and gameplay mechanics not working. Furthermore, even though the story is heart pounding and thrilling, I found that the story was very predictive and I was able to predict what was going to happen next. If you can get past the mound of glitches, the game has a lot of potentials. :)"

777,alhabor,"Feb 25, 2019",8,"Игра понравилась. Это главное. В нее интересно было играть.Плюсы:- Отличная атмосфера сгинувшего мира. Путешествия по просторной стране.- Хоть и действительно открытых локаций всего две - Волга и Каспий (остальные довольно коридорные), они красочные и аутентичные.- Простенький, но интересный сюжет.- Погодные эффекты, освещение.- Приятно стрелять и вообще наблюдать за поведением оружия. На хорошем уровне сложности патронов не хватает (как и должно быть в постапокалиптичном мире).- Темп повествования. Игра не торопит с прохождением, дает размеренно играть. Открытые локации сменяются динамическими коридорными. Между локациями можно неторопливо ходить по поезду, который постоянно преображается, слушать друзей, выйти покурить из вагона и насладиться видами проносящейся мимо страны, а можно сразу включить следующую миссию.- Откуда у людей столько багов? Я встретил только баг с включением фонарика (включались фары машины вместо фонарика) и зависшая в небе горгулья. Игра шла на ультра настройках на совсем не крутой системе (i7 4770, 1080 3Gb, 16Gb) удивительно плавно. Ни одного вылета.Минусы:- Скомканная концовка. Для меня было шоком, что игра так резко оборвалась. По сути, все самое интересное и все то, к чему мы стремимся всю игру (найти новый дом) - показывается в финальной заставке за полторы минуты. Я ожидал, что мы так же как и раньше приедем на место, разведаем территорию, что-то преодолеем и сможем обустроиться. Или хотя бы путешествие на поезде до финального места, с разговорами, с лечением Ани, восстановлением Артема, обоснованием выбора именно этого места и прочим, но все это даже в заставке не показали, хотя по игре прошло два месяца.- Громкий топот ног... Как в Сталкере. И такое ощущение, что даже сэмпл тот же. Многие звуки окружения показались заимствованными оттуда.- Союзники слишком положительные все. Напрашивался если и не злодей-предатель, то хотя бы бунт на корабле.- Пустота открытых локаций. Кроме тех мест, что идут по главному квесту, существуют два типа мест - лагерь бандитов или гнезда мутантов. За исключением парочки.- Молчаливый ГГ. Вероятно, тут задумка того, что игрок должен отождествляться с ГГ и додумывать реплики сам, но с таким обилием разговоров это смотрится крайне нелепо!- Мелочи, например корявость в движении ГГ, когда он не может перешагнуть маленькие препятствия, или топорная анимация  ГГ - это видно по тени: двигаются только ноги. Если вам не близок дух путешествий, тема железной дороги и бескрайности, разнообразия России, вы, наверное, не прочувствуете большую часть атмосферы, заложенную в игру.Кроме концовки, я получил удовольствие от игры. К тому же, это сингл-плейерная игра с нормальным сюжетом, без захвата вышек и перекатов с укрытиями, каких становится все меньше."

Я играл в первое издание и там были баги с освещением, с тенями, с озвучкой ( в частности русской ), баги с травой и фонариком. Озвучка не совпадает с произношением рта, рот двигается сам по себе, даже когда уже озвучка прошла. Летающие кусты, баги с быстрым сохранением, все это - недостатки. Возможно, что верноятно, их всех пофиксят, но игру выпустили сырой. Но есть большое НО. Погружение в игру великолепное, взаимодействие с персонажами с ""Авроры"" на высшем уровне, ты можешь слушать истории, байки, рассказы про местности и тд. Веселая атмосфера дополняет внутреннего успокоения во время всех битв. Жалко что Артём не сих пор не говорит... Столько сцен можно было звучить с ним.

Old pictures, country rooms with nice curtains. Old computers from the 90s. Ahh.. A nostalgy. And a very dynamic, very cool storyline. And the final. I cried at it. Poor Melnick. Gameplay is very, very good. For 20 hours I had only 1 freeze of game. I've already bought an expansion pack - 2 new DLCs. I love all the Metro games, I buy  Metro books (almost every of them). But Metro Exodus is the best of them. Glukhovsky is not only a great writer, he's a great scenarist. Офигенная игра! Здесь все такое родное, как из детства. Вот поезд с купе, будто бы из 90-х. Все эти надписи, календари и картины на стене, занавесочки. Старые телевизоры и компьютеры. Разрушенные деревенские домики с иконами. Все это так мило. Но, конечно же, главное в игре - сюжет. И здесь он на высшем уровне. В меру динамичен, в меру вдумчив. Глуховский как сценарист сильно вырос - только посмотрите, какой финал. Я почти что плакала а конце.

793,Spike23,"Mar  3, 2019",6,"When Last Light was released, I was so surprised by its quality that until now I was personally always thinking about as a similar experience to the masterpiece that had been released a few months before - the one and only Bioshock Infinite. After this sequel however, I am not sure anymore if I can keep thinking that, because even though the overall atmosphere was outstandingly captured throughout the whole variety of all the non-repetitive post-apocalyptic locations, making the gameplay not boring, considering there's not much originality in it, it was seriously difficult to enjoy the game as a whole, when most of the times someone is talking to you in the most generic monologues I have probably ever encountered in a game so far, unable to stop even after 5 minutes of observing that NPC in disbelief, just to see how many lines of monologues it has (not mentioning when those NPCs start to argue). This somehow doesn't make sense to me, since I've read all the books, and despite me not being able to enjoy the sequels as much as the first one, there's absolutely no doubt that it is really well-written. And the last thing I would say about Exodus is that it is well-written, because in comparison to the books, most of the dialogues here seem like a 15-year old's first try for a post-apo novel, making every character  more and more intolerable with every attempt to relate to them, and care for them, resulting in the exact opposite."
794,Chapa9dj,"Oct 31, 2019",10,Just wanted to change my score because the game improved quite a lot since launch and i fully recommend it.It's a fantastic game.
795,Bitek,"Mar 31, 2020",7,Exodus is the best game in the franchise. it has some gorgeous graphics and the game is long. it took me over 30 hours to completely finish it. the story is okey with different endings. shooting mechanics are pretty awesome and some weapons are pretty cool. there are many spooky moments through out the game. Many diversified environments. Some side missions and the game is semi open world. it is good game.
796,ket,"Oct  8, 2020",4,"""More of the same"" describes Exodus rather accurately. Weapons and gameplay are not anything you haven't seen before with the Redux titles and graphically Exodus does not really evolve from the Redux titles either - you'll be hard pressed to see a significant visual upgrade. The game itself is merely ""fine"", following Artyom on yet another slog facing mostly the same thing you have done before only this time you get to ride a train and go above ground a lot more. In terms of performance Exodus is very poorly optimised, or at the very least you can criticise the developers for taking away the swath of advanced graphical options the Redux titles offer and essentially leave you with dreadful ""profile"" type options, there is far too much baked in to these ""profiles"" to allow any sort of flexibility you would expect from a PC title. This game is one almost everybody should be able to play on at least ""High"" settings, but once again, the lack of graphical options you would expect from a PC title cripple performance forcing far more people than needed to drop to ""Medium"" which is just a slap in the face as this setting removes far too many graphical aspects and almost ends up looking worse than the Redux titles (which I can happily run on max settings at about 100FPS average). What posessed 4A to remove the flexibility of the graphical options I don't know but I hope the reprocussions of their actions have reverberated loudly with them. I'd like to say the game at least has a stable frame rate, but it really doesn't. I can look into the far distance with the engine fully rendering the terrain, trees, buildings, etc and get triple digit FPS even on ultra settings, but if I dare turn around and look inside the train that FPS plumments to about 40. Editing the config file for this game is a waste of time almost everything is hard coded, you can get a rather large framerate improvement by disabling TAA, but this then also severely messes up lighting in the game, everything is just a damn mess technically speaking. Exodus isn't a terrible game it has its moments and if you liked the Redux titles there might be something for you here but the technical issues is what earns this game a low score from me."
797,AlphaRebel,"Feb  3, 2020",8,"The third game in the series, it's a definite recommend to anyhow to played the previous 2 but I would say it's probably a much harder sell for people new to the series.Levels can drag a *little* and the standing around while NPC verbose at you for hours on end can be a little wearing on the patience but overall the levels are a really good mix of environments and you are saved from it being too repetitive.I really enjoyed it and it did bring the series to a really nice close."
798,Frisbiek,"Mar  6, 2019",6,"Waaaay too short and not a lot to do.  It's very scripted and linear, which is not a problem, but when it's this short and offers very little replayability, you aren't really getting your money's worth.  Which is too bad, because the atmosphere, sound effects, music, is spot on.  The only other issue is that the dialogue is extremely cheesy.  I'm not sure if it's how a lot of the dialogue got translated, but the dialogue throughout is very distracting. Overall a pretty good experience, but I was shocked and disappointed with how short the game is.  There are literally just four areas- six if you count the opening segment and a bunker you play through- but there isn't a lot to do in each area, and I really took my time to explore them all."

And the graphic quality of low setting is already quite decent yet deprived of any latest visual effects.ContThe plot is a complete trash.  The 'horrid writing' Mass Effect Andromeda has been cursed for is a masterpiece of literature comparing to the creation of 4A games and Gluhovsky.Balancing, AI  and nearly everything else. Current metacritic score 6.2 completely reflects the quality of the game.

800,Newfr,"Mar  4, 2019",5,"Экзодус – посредственная игра и ни разу не Метро. Это какой-то Far Cry с переводным дураком и матерями-одиночками. Причем наиболее удались именно подземные коридорные миссии, а весь этот типа открытый мир на поверхности вызывает только недоумение и вопрос ""а вот нахера?"".Самое печальное в этой всей истории – это сюжет. Его, по сути, нет. Если вы не считаете за сюжет что-то типа «мы ищем новый дом, но Подмосковье, где все ок (кроме мутантов, но они везде, как показала практика) нам не годится почему-то». В остальном у нас какие-то тактические задачи, мол, нужны спутниковые снимки из Каспия-1 и на чем-то уехать оттуда. Надо добраться до Авроры и уехать отсюда к херам (2 раза). И везде нам тонко намекают, мол, тут херово, но вот в Новосибирске… Ну, и как в приснопамятной HL2 вы уже понимаете, что того самого Новосиба вам не избежать.И вот проходишь ты игру, смотришь титры и думаешь, блин вот во что я только что играл? И вроде на одном дыхании прошел и вроде неплохо было все…а как будто обертку красивую развернул, а там – говно вместо конфеты. Игра ни о чем, филер какой-то вместо достойного завершения серии. Сука, как Масс Эффект – решаются судьбы Галактики, эпичное превозмогание, вроде даже последняя часть более-менее, но финал обсерает все и ты такое сидишь и, мол, какого хера? Только вместо цветной мутотени тут вся разница в количестве могил (острая лучевая болезнь переливанием крови не лечится, даже легкая форма). Что с черными? Они вроде как сквозная тема первых двух частей, а в третьей как будто и нет их (можно мельком увидеть в трех местах, как говорят Интернеты, но сюжетно они не участвуют никак). Анна вроде беременна была во второй части? Ничего объяснить не надо? То, что было в 1 и 2 Метро оставлено позади, то что происходит сейчас – недорассказано и брошено в дыму уходящего поезда. На логику и сюжет положен большой волосатый прибор. Мельник превращается в истеричную 12-летнюю девченку и не обращает внимание, что радист из Ковчега с ним общается как какой-то ударенный пыльным мешком гражданский... Ай, если обращать внимание на всю ту хератень, что не вяжется ни с логикой, ни со здравым смыслом уйдет куда больше 5000 знаков. Так эпично просрать все полимеры...Отдельный привет за Эпик Стор. И особенно за того товарища из разработчиков, который потом в Интернетах говнился на эту тему."
801,akarnokd,"Nov 29, 2020",7,"An atmospheric 3rd installment of the Metro franchise, now with a much clearer way to achieve a good ending or a bad ending, given that in the previous game, Artyom died as it required quite an effort to get the good ending. I remembered Anna but not the other guys so can't tell much of the characters. The story is okay and the world atmosphere is fantastic. That post-soviet world building was very accurate. I liked the open-world maps. The main drawback of the game is that one can't skip cutscenes and dialogs, which for the subsequent playthroughts (i.e., Ranger Hardcode or Iron Mode) was kind of frustrating. I found sneaking to be not fun and particularly hard sometimes. Also the game crashed a few times, once during Iron Mode so I lost half a map worth of progress. As for the Epic/Steam debacle, I bought it on Steam discounted after it was released a year later. The exclusivity wasn't such a nice step from the publisher/devs but I knew I won't have the time to play the game right when it released anyway. So I got it cheap, with achievements, guides and most problems already iron'd out."

806,garyc,"Mar 12, 2019",8,"Not quite a masterpiece but a good solid game.On the good side it's very atmospheric, has a half decent if predictable story, looks great and has more than good enough performance, it's really good fun exploring the interesting locations and is a lot more open than the previous games. Oh and no microtransactions whatsoever.I can play through this and just enjoy the whole experience without anything becoming irritating. On the bad side there isn't much to complain about but if I had to be picky, the enemies have AI right out of the early 2000's and the weapons are not all that satisfying to use. While nowhere near as bad, it does have a slight 'Fallout' feel to the shooting. Loot is also a little lacking in variety with 90% of the stuff you find being the same crafting materials. On the technical side it is heavily lacking in visual options. This is fine if you have a decent system but I feel if you were on a lower end machine and needed to make some tweaks you would be out of luck. Overall it's not a revolution, it's more Metro with better visuals and some more open ended environments. But for sure ignore the people giving it low scores because of business decisions - this is definitely worth playing."
807,robomartion,"Oct 22, 2019",6,"Metro Exodus is an exodus from what made the Metro series so good in the first place. It's a serviceable entry into a tired series lacking any real distinction of its own.

809,Kragmire,"May  9, 2019",6,"So close... and yet so far.  This game represents such unrealized potential.  Having played and enjoyed the earlier games, I was hoping for more... but got less.  It's like the developer ran out of time or money and just started cutting corners.  There are some good ideas, partially realized, but mostly it feels like a mish-mash of cobbled-together concepts that lack consistency and depth. The core idea of fleeing Moscow on a train and adventuring a post-nuclear countryside is a classic, yet for some reason plays out like a slide show of maps with only a couple of side quests tossed in for flavor.  The linear tunnel shooter, with minimal choice and loads of cut-scenes, is never far away - forcing you to play your character exactly the way the game has decided he is going to be played.  The ending has already been determined before you first load the game - all the rest is window dressing. I won't dwell on our mute protagonist, which has been mentioned in just about every game review that I've read.  To have NPC's in the game come up and talk to you... and you just stand there silently... is a cringe-worthy moment in any game, and it happens far too frequently in this one. If the game starts with limited open-world adventuring, as you progress you end up back in the linear tunnel shooter full-time.  Some of the levels are literally the exact same as in prior games, with NPC's dismissing the similarity as ""all XYZ bunkers were built the same"" or ""these subway tunnels all have the same configuration"".  Sad. The end-game is actually so boring I found myself running through/past all the fights because I just wanted to see how the game was going to turn out.  I no longer cared about my character, or collecting gear, because it felt more and more like nothing I did mattered.  And I was right... because the predetermined end-game is so trite it could have been written by 13 year-old girls. The game IS beautiful.  There were moments on the train where I truly stood and watched the landscape stream by.  The settings are detailed and interestingly crafted - if far too linear.  You will always know what you are supposed to be doing, and where you are supposed to be going.  In some cases the path will even be lit by conveniently placed glowing mushrooms.  Go here... loot this... go there... loot that... cutscene. The game ran fine on my RTX machine, but I still encountered some bugs and graphical anomalies - though no game crashes.  NPC's walking through floors... objects floating in air... strange hit boxes that prevented you from hitting a monster even when you are firing at it at point-blank ranges. The UI is pretty bad as well.  You hit ""E"" to loot a corpse, and hit ""R"" to strip a weapon that is lying on the ground... or else you hold down ""E"" to pick up the weapon and drop whatever weapon you are currently holding.  Hit ""F"" to turn on your light... or hold ""F"" to equip your electrical charger... etc.  You soon find yourself holding a key you meant to hit, or hitting a key you meant to hold, and you drop nice gear, or turn off your light - usually at inopportune moments. Ultimately, though, it is the flimsy game story that ruined the game for me.  All the NPC's have as much depth as a puddle, and the dialogue is written for six year-olds.  You end up not caring about what happens, because you don't care about the NPC's that are supposed to be so the reason you are risking your life.  And the never-ending cut-scene at the end of the game?  Is it 15 minutes?  More?  It just goes on and on and on... and trust me, it ain't worth it to stick around to the bitter end.Coulda woulda shoulda.  Game was too short, and even so, I feel no desire to replay it given the linearity and lack of personal choice.  The METRO franchise took a big step backwards with this game. [EDIT] I just learned there is a ""good"" ending to the game that requires you to sneak past and not kill a significant number of hostile mobs in the game.  So if they see you, they shoot you.  But if you shoot them in self-defense, you die at the end of the game.  In at least one of these cases, I approached a group of (what I thought were neutral) soldiers, with my weapon holstered in the middle of the day.  They immediately shot me down.  And yet... I am supposed to protect these guys?  A horrific game design decision - and one that doesn't make the game more enjoyable, but simply frustrating and tedious.  Talk about suspension of dis-belief.  If I am walking around in a nuclear wasteland and you open fire on me, expect to die.  Even knowing this, I feel no desire to replay the game to get this ""good"" ending.  The game was too tedious already when I got to fight the hostile mobs.  Having to hide from them and sneak past... the thought makes my eyes bleed."

At first the narrative cinema was distracting but, soon getting to the next one became an obsession.  The story was great if you were a teen in the 80's wondering what would happen if some idiot would think a nuclear attack is ""an easy win.""  The game play is challenging, the graphics were wonderful, and fit the story well. The ending was pleasant yet sad - let's say appropriate and it included some nice dramatic pauses.  Well worth the time.  1 warning -- I probably will not buy off Epic games till I see players mention stable more.  The cloud syncs and frozen screens during saves were very aggravating, too much so.  But, for the comments containing Dev ""filler"" and bad story I say ""not helpful.""  4A Games spent a perfect amount of time and thought on this game.

Прокачка магаза, ствола, приклада, и т.д Можно например из револьвера сделать карманную снайперку, а из калаша пулемет. Оружие теперь может испортиться, поэтому надо следить за ним, и постоянно лутаться. У вас постоянно будет не хватать патронов. Сама сюжетка очень интересная, а концовка заставляет рыдать. Атмосфера игра просто не опесуемая. + за Цоя. Баги были, но редко, еще проблемы иногда с регистрацией пуль, но в целом игра просто шикарна. Рекомендую всем"
818,CharlePL,"Aug 17, 2020",7,"Nice continuation of the metro series, however not as spectacular as i.e. 1st game. Graphics are definitely improved and world looks nice. Gun play could have been slightly better. Sometimes your shots dont register. From time to time an enemy doesnt shoot you from 3 meters but can headshot you easily from 50 meters. Game has some technical bugs however not game breaking."

820,BenFoldsLaundry,"Nov 16, 2020",4,"WARNING: Do not buy this game through Epic. All my other games work fine, but this one is a crash fest. Using a 2080 Super. I can not finish the game because I have to do a hard restart over and over no matter what settings I'm on, and the Epic customer support is a joke. I don't know if this is an issue with Metro, or Epic? The gameplay itself wasn't bad. I was enjoying the journey through Russia with my crew, and would have loved to finish the game, but like I said... The graphics are just okay, some images are very blurry. DLSS is completely broken with this game. Turning it off doesn't help the optimization though. The story isn't the most captivating. However being on a train together creates a sensation of always moving forward, and there are some bright moments to be found within the frozen tundras.  Can't recommend on the account of how many times the game has hard crashed my PC. ."
821,GodBeliever,"Feb 28, 2019",6,"Pros:- Not bad story line.- Locations and Graphics.Cons:- Useless open world.- Useless Monsters, which is respawning every time, there is no meaning to kill them, it is waste of resources.- Poor choice of weapons.- There is no instant travel points.- Side quests are too bad.- The main character of game have no ability to speak, total mute, and dialogues are absant too.It was so beautiful on the last map of game, and the metro there reminded me previous games, when there is no hope, everything is dead, only monsters are waiting you, and you struggle in your desperate fight just to live in this hell. And new game atmosphere gives you hope and place where you can live in peace, that is why partialy i do not like new metro exodus."
822,paulust2002,"Feb 22, 2019",7,"Last light is my favourite game of this generation, a testament to it being the fact its a remake. I felt this would be overly ambitious for the studio and I was correct . The opening is clunky and weak but are there to draw you from the old games....then this gives way to atmospheric and immersive open levels, but when you feel you are adapting to this the last level really ruins the flow and quality of the game. I felt it would be a better game without the last couple of hours that seemed like padding without any of the open feel of the mid game. Maybe they run out of money or ideas, but it really needed an open sandbox for this section. Positives - Graphics, Weather and day/night cycle, Atmosphere, Sound design, dolby atmos support, mid section of game, Crafting.... Negatives - AI, New creatures, last level, reduction of weird and scary moments, poor and cluttered mix of audio remains, new monsters in last quarter, poor loading time initially, some controller lag on xbox one x, crushed gamma on xbox. HOLD X TO DO STUFF."
823,Kralle,"Feb 25, 2019",7,"So rather than giving the game a knee-jerk rating of 0/10 because I'm an entitled brat or 9/10 because I'm only interested in out-screaming said entitled brats, I'll go ahead and give my thoughts on the game. Shocker, I know. The Metro franchise has been a guilty pleasure of mine since Metro 2033. Both it and Last Light, as well as the Redux versions, hold secure and comfortable spots in my gaming library. They have a certain charm about them, something about a smaller developer punching well above their weight and (mostly) succeeding has always been satisfying for me to see. So when Exodus was announced, I was excited. Fast forward to February 19th, 2019. I got the game, loaded it up, and dove right in. I had been amped for this moment for the entire month. Cue a CTD within 2 minutes of gaining control of Artyom. Not a great start, but to be fair, this was the only crash I experienced over the next 30-ish hours of gameplay. In retrospect, it's one of the least frustrating problems that I had with the game. Overall, the game did meet most of my expectations for a Metro game: Heavy on the story, atmosphere, and pseudo-religious undertones. The characters were charming, their interactions exciting and engaging enough for me to spend time sitting around to listen to their conversations. The crew of the Aurora felt like distinct individuals, only hampered by the average to god awful voice cast employed on this installment. Miller *still* has only one mood/inflection, Artyom's narration is more stilted than the swamp houses in Taiga, and I'm reasonably sure Nastya was voiced by the RL daughter of one of the developers (i.e., she sounds like an actual child but deadpans/stiffly reads lines like one too.) The story itself isn't bad, indeed enjoyable enough to have kept me playing through the game. It won't be winning any prizes anytime soon, either. The biggest plot weakness for me is how disjointed and disconnected the entire early and middle portions of the game feel to the prologue and final two chapters/zones. The plotlines during these sections simply feel unnecessary or uncomfortably forced aside from a few major plot elements. 4A isn't the best at filling 25-30 hours of story, and it is painfully apparent. The main story is only really about 5 or 6 hours worth of content, everything else feels like tacked on filler. Gameplay is, for me, the biggest positive for me in Exodus. Gunplay is great, weapons sound and 'feel' very weighty and punchy compared to 2033/Last Light's cartoony sounds and handling. Firearms even jam and malfunction if you don't properly maintain them. I love the slight return to the OG 2033 gameplay: Artyom is no longer the Tank he was in Last Light, stealth is virtually a requirement for survival, and exploration and scavenging is a priority. Bullets as a currency are gone, but with the new crafting system, they are just as precious of a commodity to the player. Add in needing to craft your medkits and filters instead of being able to just horde MGR and buy them at shops, and you are often faced with an ""ammo vs. healing vs. oxygen"" dilemma, particularly in the late game. In terms of the AI: It's still Metro, so it's still Euro-Jank as heck...but it's also better. Enemies feel smarter, especially once you tip them off to your presence. They communicate with one another, calling out Artyom's location and working together to pin you down and flank you. Very rarely will enemies rush you in a gunfight. On one occasion, I fell back on tricks from previous games, expecting to be able to lure bandits towards me so I could dispatch them at my leisure. Imagine my surprise when they instead backed me into a corner, surrounded me, and sniped me from a safe distance anytime I poked my head out. With all these benefits, though, the AI still feels very janky at times: Enemies either have x-ray vision and spot you through walls in pitch black darkness or they're blind and deaf mole-men who fail to see you standing two feet in front of them in broad daylight. They often glitch into and through walls, stairs, ladders, and terrain (chase a certain marksman up a certain crane sometime to see what I mean). The biggest pitfalls the game had, the ones that had me swearing at the screen as I reloaded a checkpoint for the seventh time in a row, were all technical. Bullets harmlessly passing through enemies, the prompts to perform melee takedowns arbitrarily being unusable at very inconvenient times, and rubberbanding into visual range of enemies while vaulting/manteling are all very common and infuriating hiccups with the game. This is all exacerbated by the fact 4A decided to use a checkpoint system. While this works for a strictly linear corridor shooter, it can mean losing a half-hour's progress in one of the more open-world levels. Overall, Metro Exodus is a good (but definitely not 8/10 or 9/10 great) entry in the series, and an entertaining FPS."
824,Saren17,"Mar 28, 2019",9,"I really enjoyed Metro Exodus, I encountered a few bugs in my play-through but despite that I think it was fantastic. Incredible atmosphere, great world design, fantastic weapon customisation and mechanics. Great enemies and characters, 4A Games put a great deal of passion and love into this project and it shines through. The likes of Activison and EA need to take note that this is the way to make a game. I realise people are upset about the Epic store exclusivity deal but despite that no one can deny that Metro Exodus is a fantastic game! I think 4A deserves praise for the quality of their craftsmanship."
825,Darkvenom39,"Mar 20, 2020",6,i played the 2 original games and they were awesome! nut this one is garbage so done waste your time! story is super short and to get the good ending you need to be a good ninja and play the boring way. anyhow the game ends with so many questions and a void of nothing i was surprised and sad when the game ended because many stuff needed to be answered and it felt like the game was made by a completely different studio. im glad i didnt pay full price for this garbage and i beg you guys to not waste your time on this game!

В целом финальным забег за лекарством получился крайне унылым и хотелось просто по быстрее что бы все закончилось. Еще отмечу тупость и не всегда логичную привязку морали что сказывается на концовке. Мне досталась плохая и посмотрев то как нужно получать хорошую - желание перепроходить игру отбилось на прочь. А так в целом игра доставила."

833,Kellog,"Mar 18, 2019",10,"What a great game.  First, it's so refreshing to see a FPS game through the eyes of another culture.  There are no Vin Diesel or Tom Clancy characters in this game.  The characters in Metro Exodus feel authentically human and relatable.  I felt the situations and emotions at a gut level like it was real.The writing and direction in this game are top notch just like the beautiful graphics.  Combat is a life or death situation every time, as it should be.  You won't find yourself mindlessly sprinting to the next goal in this game!  You must use stealth whenever possible, and more importantly, stay aware of your situation. If I had to pick one negative thing about this game it would be some occasional glitchy pathing on rough terrain, but it is rare and not game breaking. I really hope to see more Metro games in the future.  That's why I'm so disappointed that some members of the community are review brigading this game because it's on the Epic store.  This behavior truly shows how immature and petty some gamers are.  All you need to do is play an online game for a few minutes to verify this fact.  So don't pay attention to these 1 and 0 scores... you will love this game."
834,Zorada,"Feb 26, 2019",6,"First off, I DO NOT CARE about the Epic Games Store and it has no bearing on my score. Now i loved the other Metro games but this one, I just do not know how I feel about it. It seemed that there was more scripting than ever before and it appeared disjointed for me like never before.  Yes the graphics are awesome BUT it plays in a choppy way once you have played for around 1/2 an hour. With a GTX 1080 i expected a little more than this and even putting graphics down to low I still had a frame drop and chop about every 30 secs much like many many people I have seen. The story is ok at best and to be honest I feel it is not the best in the series I think Last Light gets that accolade. I am sorry but I stopped playing very early on due to lag spikes and also the way the game tells you to go somewhere but for the love of god i couldnt find what it wanted me to do when i got there. I ended up giving up and I cannot see me restart anytime soon. Maybe if they  get the choppyness gone i will try again but I feel let down."
835,kolt1911,"Feb 26, 2019",6,"4A Games отличились. Создали линейный шутер в котором нужно как можно меньше убивать. Браво! Молодцы!А если серьезно то чем постоянно упарываются разрабы из 4A Games когда придумывают такие гениальные механики для шутера, непонятно. В нормальных играх выбор игрока в той или иной ситуации влияет на концовку, а не стиль прохождения. Тем более что игра в пост апокалиптическом сеттинге. А как известно в таких реалиях человеческая жизнь ценится очень низко. Это игра не плоха, но на игру года или шедевр не тянет.﻿ Вот например если я не умею играть по стелсу или не хочу этого делать? Почему в итоге плохая концовка? Про баги говорить нечего. Они те же что и в первом Метро. Ну надеюсь пофиксят патчами. Игра эта на 6 - 7 баллов максимум."
836,protech,"May 25, 2021",10,"I completely don't understand the criticism - those people are either looking for something PERFECT, or have some other issues. Having experienced this game for the second time just now (Enhanced Edition,  finished  regular one in 2019), I am just reinforced in that this is one of the top games of all times without doubt. It can go toe to toe with any other similar game from the top - graphics are top notch, gameplay is excellent, story is excellent, sound, voice acting is so good (person voicing Colonel Miller should get an award) - and the atmosphere in the game is just phenomenal. To me, it does all of those better than, for example, Fallout 3 / NV / 4 (which is one of my favorite franchises) and it barely ever gets mentioned - severely underrated. I mean, Metacritic says ""#41 best PC game of 2019"" - WHAT?! There were FORTY ONE better games just in 2019?? That's absolutely ridiculous - this is top 50 of all time. Seasons, factions that you encounter are really unique and interesting, the way the worlds reacts to you, the amount and quality of side-stories and lore, each of your team members has a unique personality and is distinct and ""alive"" - I could go on and on...It has so much more soul than most of other games. Of course it's not perfect and there are so many opportunities that could have made it even better - but nothing is perfect and this game does great. 4A Games have my huge respect, this is an amazing achievement and I hope people that worked on the game are crazy proud about what they created - it deserves all the praise it can get."
837,gameking,"Dec 16, 2020",9,This game is very good. The graphics and story is very strong. I didn't like to main character's not speak. The atmosphere is awesome. I really like this game. But the optimization is not good enough.

840,skcyte,"Feb 23, 2019",6,"The game is somewhat mediocre. It's a good game nonetheless compared to previous one. The more open map is definitely one of the greatest point in this game but the feel of urgency is really made the side quest somewhat irrelevant. The graphic is beautiful but sadly there's not many option for PC gamer to customize to find balance performance and look. Cut scenes mainly bad because of voice acting and sound / music choices. The awkward pause, the overlapping voices, and the sound FX when you thought it's gonna be climax scene but in the end it's just feels off. The story is good but at some point it's predictable. Artyom cannot speaks in-game just heartbreaking in a story driven game. The immersion and interaction with other members are just a turn off. But in the end it's the end of Artyom's journey and it's a good send off. FPS and game play mechanics are below average of any modern shooters. The movements are clunky, slow and heavy, you walk like a turtle doing a baby step. Jumping over a small ledge can triggered the slow animation. The AI is not great. Shot can miss when you thought you had a clear shot of the enemy even on a close distance. Crafting another point of the game that can feels unnecessary. Playing pacifist doesn't really need that much ammo since you probably only use it for mutants though sometimes it's just not worth it to fight some mutants. So in the end the game is good. Just some technical choices that developers made is not great."
841,FelixWeissman,"Feb 25, 2019",7,"Nos encontramos ante un juegazo con autentico gameplay, hasta da miedo en algunos puntos, desde luego es de lo mejorcito que trae metro. Lastima que quede sepultado ante un lanzamiento demasiado temprano, la carretilla de problemas técnicos y cosas sin pulir  que arrastra es simplemente descomunal, hasta el punto de que si te hechas hacia atrás en el primer mapa te encuentras con los limites, ni muros invisibles ni nada, vas te tiras al vacío y ala, incluso hay dos modelos de personajes que alguien se dejo ahí sin activar en la hora del almuerzo.Yo no pagaria mas de 50 euros por el."
842,empleat101,"Mar  1, 2019",7,"Amazing graphics for sure. Story is not anything special, but it is good. But this game suffers from bad mechanics. Looking around is sluggish, i have hard time to aim, even i am not having fps drops. Can't carry more than 90 ammo. Accuracy not good either on more than 25m aiming at head with x4 optics and it doesn't hit. Than mutant not dying after whole mag emptied to the head and there is no way to go and than he one hit kills you, killing monsters was more annoying than fun. Than paddling around in a boat isn't much fun, one time it is okay. But than it is annoying, if i need pass small distance, like 10 meter, why do i have to use boat, i may walk across aswell.There is some electric anomaly which killed me 10 times and even it is not in my path, it kills me and i waited long time in order to it to move and it just moves around and where is it most far away, it still kills me. So fun dying repeatedly to it. It is hard to see in game, like it has bad contrast or something, i don't know how to describe it. And multiple times i had trouble to find a way. Not best design.One time you drop to the hole and have to find way out, in this case it is okay, but if i am literally progressing forward, it is annoying to find a way on every corner - like in that hall i have to find that train. Crafting isn't much fun either having constantly to pick some items from boxes, or picking up mushrooms and controls are counter-intuitive bit, not only for crafting, but for everything. Ui not so great either, can't see health for example, or hold tab to switch see and switch rounds. After playing some more, there weren't that many annoyances and not much boat travel. It isn't that bad. there are some interesting locations, tho killing mutants is a bit repetetive. It had couple bugs nothing major."
843,gaston3089,"Feb 28, 2019",7,"Es un juego aceptable, visualmente es imponente pero tiene un tema que lleva arrastrando desde el primer metro: el sonido.tanto les cuesta pulir este tema? mas que nada los diálogos, en los que por ahí hay un personaje principal que esta hablando y tienes a un NPC al lado hablando idioteces, en un volumen mucho mas alto, sin contar que cuando se ponen a hablar puedes dejarlos y se quedan hablando solos!Por otro lado, la forma en que llevan la historia, me refiero a la forma de contarla mas alla de las misiones se hace aburrida, densa por momentos, con diálogos y mas diálogos que terminan dispersando la atención y el interés en la historia.Ciertamente el personaje principal tiene el complejo ""Gordon Freeman"" ya que no dice una sola palabra en estas horas que llevo jugando, lo cual me hace pensar que sus creadores le quisieron dar una fuerte influencia half life, que claramente no tiene."
844,Teerhand,"Mar  3, 2019",6,"First and foremost, i have to say that i really enjoyed Metro Last Light and the original iteration of th Metro series. A lot of that due to the fact, that the atmosphere and story was interesting, conclususive and fresh.both parts were produced, working together with the author of the novel, gluchowski, and maybe thats exactly what is lacking in exodus.i don´t care so much about graphics, they are allright in exodus, gunplay is pretty bad, but well i could live with that too, but man, the acting and story are pretty terrible in the first hour of the game.I´m even contemplating if i should even bother to keep playing the game. also the atmosphere of the first games was a tightly woven concept, whereas exodus doesn´t have that character, it seems pretty random honestly. level design is pretty boring as well. damn, that was a pretty smart move, to get epic as the exclusive distributing platform, now people are complaining about that, instead of the fact, that this is a mediocre game.6/10 would refund on steam as well"
845,Graham67722,"Mar 14, 2019",9,The game has great graphics but they are poorly optimized.  I really liked the story even more than last night.  The rpg elements that have been added are to the benefit of the game.  I have never really played an open world fps like this.  I would highly recommend this game and it is the best game of the year so far.
846,Alternatekek,"Mar 13, 2019",10,"Ignore the bad reviewsAnyone who says this game isnt optimized most likely tried turning raytracing on their 1060I on the other hand have a 2080, I7 7700. I consider this highish mid range and I can run this on ultra with 4k resolutions just fine when I lower the shading rate. In regards to the game, its a very decent length with over 3 huge zones to discover. Ignore anyone saying you won't have direction and it lacks a story because if you actually play it correctly you will hit every single extra spot and be super prepared for the later sections. The guns are amazing, lots of different upgrade options and EVERY single gun is useful. Characters are done very well, I was honestly crying at the end. Stealth is done very well, people who suck at video games will say its ""too hard"" or ""impossible"" to not kill the guys the games asks you not to kill, but trust me you gotta be braindead to not sneak past these guys. I grinded out the game and beat it within 2 weeks because I loved it so much, I typically get bored half way through games, this time I DID NOT."
847,WarV,"Mar 13, 2019",9,"I was quite pleasantly surprised with exodus. The game still has a lot of linear scripted sequences like its predecessors, but now they tried to do few small open world areas, and the game has a stalker vibe to it in few places. Shooting is good, and the weapon modification system is really cool. Exodus looks beautiful although performance ranges from fine to real bad depending on the area; Overall i think its a really good game, even though it's quite buggy."

849,jpeezy789,"Mar 14, 2019",10,"This game is absolutely incredible. I ran it with RTX 2080 and used the Ray Tracing, and I have to say it made the game look beautiful. The story is captivating and there is options to listen to more story or to walk away. There is a ton of side dialogue and this builds the world and immerses the player. The ending is superb. I haven't played a game with as good of an ending in a very long time! There were some graphical imperfections such as guns, people and animations clipping through other objects, but this is mostly nitpicking. I never encountered anything game breaking (this is impressive in its own respect, as its hard to perfect an open world game of this size)..The crafting is simple in gathering, as there are only 2 resources to worry about. The crafting of the guns is very in depth and I always looked forward to finding another modification from looting fallen enemies. Guns feel and sound very good. Also, love the dirtying of the weapons. I had to think about which guns I would walk around with in my hands as these would get dirtiest the fastest. Enemy types are somewhat varied, though most of them are just thugs. You can try to stealthily take them down with your fists and this will lead to a reputation of a pacifist (this is what I chose for my first playthrough). You can also blow their brains out with silenced weapons and retain stealth, or go all out with a minigun or some such and take them head on. The outcome of the game will not probably differ too much. These actions will only define how the enemy interprets your character in their side conversations. The mutants in this game are quite interesting also! None of them are too scary (thinking back to Librarians in 2033.... scary!). They have their own attack and movement styles and patterns and make interesting and unique sounds. Characters are all very good. They all seem like a well functioning team and each gets their turn in the story and being alongside with the player, although some get more of the lime light than others. I still cared about each of the members of The Order throughout the game. I've actually made a Metacritic account just to review this game. I think that it is definitely worth paying for (even though I got it for free with my purchase of RTX gpu). I would support these developers and am very hopeful for another entry in this series!"

The story and atmosphere are on par with what I've come to expect from the Metro series, but Exodus takes this experience to new heights.

Of course, the technical part of the game is not perfect, came across 2-3 bugs, which, nevertheless, didn't spoil the experience much. And, to be frank, this is not the 10/10 game, I'd give 9/10. The reason I am putting the highest rating possible is the army of strange people, who are literally bombing the game with 0s and 1s just for the fact IT IS NOT ON STEAM. Literally, no one is complaining about their origin and battlenet clients, but everyone claims EGS is bad ""because I have to install another launcher"". What's the point?I just wanted to say I loved the game, it is a good continuation of the first two metro games, and if you liked them, don't be afraid to pay and play Metro Exodus - you will never regret about it! Спасибо за хорошую игру, с нетерпением жду продолжения!"
855,Maxkho,"Mar 22, 2019",10,"Hands-down the best game I have ever played. The atmosphere is unreal and indescribable, and the graphics are unparalleled. This vibes of being in a post-WW3 world didn't leave me for at least a week IN REAL LIFE after having completed the game, and I have since gone on a week-long WW3 information consumption streak, watching videos and reading Wikipedia articles about things to do with WW3. I have never ever experienced anything like this before, and I didn't know a video game could do that to you. The story is predictable but very believable and, in my opinion REALLY interesting once you have fully immersed yourself in the game. The gameplay is good, and while it may feel a bit sluggish and slow-paced at first, you will actually find that it does GREAT with your immersion and creating that constant vulnerable, ominous, and uneasy feeling. AI, let's be honest, is just bad, which sucks, as it does break your immersion sometimes, and graphics glitches do occur; however, I can forgive this game everything for the literally mind-boggling and out-of-this-world atmosphere that it has created around this game, and also the astonishing graphics, lighting (I played with ray-tracing on, and recommend you do, too (if you can), and amount of detail which only reinforce the already impossible feeling of immersion. Objectively speaking, I'd give it an 8.5, as it has got problems with glitches, AI, somewhat cliched general story, and also occasional, random low-res textures; however, if you manage to immerse yourself in the game even a little bit, I can guarantee you will have an unearthly experience. It's not perfect, but giving it anything less than a 10/10 would be a crime on my part."
856,Ransom00,"May 19, 2019",2,"Very nice graphics and the atmosphere. Stupid stealth gameplay nearly in the whole game that ruining the impression in general. I don't like stealth actions. Why do I should play stealth almost 70% of the game just to be ""good person"" and to have ""good"" ending."
857,boeph,"Apr  7, 2019",7,"В целом игра увлекательная, особенно проработка сюжета, графика. Но до звания шедевра ей мешает дотянуть убогая оптимизация и принужденность проходить половину игры в стелс-режиме ради хорошей концовки. Эта игра вполне отличное завершение удачной трилогии."
858,Crow47,"Apr 14, 2019",5,"The game simply isn't fun. I'm not sure what happened here, but I feel like I'm playing 2033 with a fresh coat of paint and global illumination. I feel this game is the epitome of ""beauty is skin deep"".  This is a tedious mess that plays like a game from 2009. Your character feels drunk, and there are a myriad of elements in the environment to hinder your movement, adding to the pain. Simply traversing point A to point B is a chore. Your guns feel as though they fire rubber pellets, not bullets, and I find myself going through extreme amounts of ammo with the most basic of enemies. Oh yah, it's a ""survival"" game so all the resources, ammo, and health are scarce as f*** now, too. Environments are cramped and claustrophobic, offering little opportunity to make use of your weapons. Considering the amount of fighting taking place within 10 feet of your character, it is infuriating your only close attack is a weak sauce melee. Your health doesn't regenerate, and your character is made of paper, so you run through med kits with ease. You have to craft these, too. I can tell the developers wanted to make something ""challenging"", and ""gritty"", but instead the game is simply tedious, offering little compensation for your struggle. Not on Steam? The publisher knew they had a game that would never be profitable on its own, so the only way to break even was take Epic's money and cash in on whatever hype they had before anyone had a chance to play the game."
859,CrazyDoc666,"Apr 23, 2019",1,Game is okay and enjoying the story so far but so many issues with the EPIC launcher and crashing. I think this will be my last Epic Games purchased title.
860,svonton,"Jan 13, 2020",8,"as all my reviews, start from common things - just finished and never played previous game of series - yeah that my style =D so whats game about ? probably you know, but i will say it shortly: it final stage of artem's adventure in deadly world of mother Russia after nuclear war. sounds interesting isn't it ? developers tried to make it more interesting by adding a train - yeah. it's train adventure by whole territory of Russia with different biomes (in this game we can find tropic, desert, winter post apocalypses locations). not only different locations can surprise player, guns design can do it to. but not so good as we would like. i mean face animations, character animations leave much to be desired. the same goes for whole game work i mean on my pc it just deadly freeze after 2hours of work (but may be its only my problem idk). after all it seriously great game about life in post apocalypses world."

862,VXTRN,"May 31, 2020",0,Fantastic game for all lovers of the post-apocalypse. It offers an oppressive atmosphere and provides the usual metro thrill. The step towards smaller open worlds areas is an enourmous enrichment of the otherwise already very good Metro universe. The gunplay as well as the story know how to convince.
863,Kadirov,"Oct  7, 2020",9,"-Как либерал я соглашусь с тем, что игра - политическая пропаганда. Но не столько против левых идеалов, а против СССР и России в частности. В игре много двоемыслия, лицемерия и двойных стандартов.Также явно глуховский то ли даун ибо не верит что на западе бывают свои пропагандоны(ну эту профессию не в России изобрели, честно) и что они не ангелы коими себя разумеется рисуют (и не они одни), то ли ему приплачивают подобно наши отстёгивают всяким петухам на западе, чтобы те хейтили их режимы. -Противоборствующие стороны -  это просто гротескные персонажи детских сказок и графомания из фантазий школьника, напоминает высеры эмо-девочек в 2007ом году.Людоеды (из КПСС, разумеется, откуда еще?), пионеры и пираты (привет Ералаш), религиозные фанатики поклоняющиеся рыбе. Более смешно и инфантильно придумать разложение общества сложно.Глуховский по уровню серьезности не превышает фанфики и его офигительные истории по взрослости уступают даже детским комиксам.Можно было менее гротескно раскрыть проблемы общества и показать реальный ужас, которого мы в игре не увидели. Зато было дохуя пропаганды и выставление русских идиотами. Типичный необъективный бунтующий ксенопатриот - сам был таким же в 13 лет, помню. Но почему себя так же все еще ведет 40летний мужик - это вызывает вопросы. Не может быть взрослый человек настолько инфантильным, тут либо образ бунтаря, либо приплачивают. -Куколдия про неубийства. Такая пропаганда ни к чему не приведет и абсолютно неуместна, люди играют чтобы выпустить пар, а они такой хуйней лишь его аккумулируют, в результате чего человек может наверное и ебнуть кого-то ирл при возможности, вспомнив как ему 50 часов ебали мозг в игре куколдо-хуйней. (ни к чему не призываю, не оправдываю преступников, отъебитесь уже пидоры)Скорее всего сделана как попытка противопоставить ""добрых"" правых  и плохих жестоких воинственных левых. Не смотря на говно от Глуховского, 4A Games создали шикарный продукт в плане геймдизайна, души и атмосферы. Эмоции были противоречивы и за ""декоммунизацию"", за уничтожение памятника Ленина - человека что сделал рабов гражданами с правами... Ну, глуховский явно имперская ультра-правая празь, что поддерживает неравенство и эксплуатацию, таким как он не место в современном мире. Пишут тут в отзывах про ""баги"" - я никогда их в играх вообще не встречал, хотя у меня компьютеру уже почти 5 лет.Просто, наверное, уважаемые, нужно играть на адекватном железе, уверен у этих даунят пекам более 10 лет и все они разумеется ""игровые""."
864,MrUnity,"Jul 22, 2019",8,"В целом игра получилась хорошо. Однако есть свои минусы. Например оптимизация, она оказалась далеко от идеала. Постоянные микро-фризы, а также баги с анимацией связанные с ними. Освещение и отражения, а также дизайн локаций получился достойно и атмосферно. Диалоги да и в общем сюжет достаточно интересен и колоритен, в общем если вы любите атмосферу сталкера, то я советую эту игру к прохождению. Сам я остался доволен покупкой. (Несколько слов об Epic Games, Метро Исход я купил там. Особых проблемм с запуском игры не было, да...там отсутствуют некоторые особенности Steam (достижения и облачные сохранения), так что если вы не чураетесь Эпичного магазина, то можете немного сэкономить и купить там)."

I was a big fan of original books and first two games, but did hesitate to buy a new one till 08.2019. Although game was positioned as AAA and I personally didn't experience any technical issues, i was disappointed. Such a waste of money and time. Dead and dumb dialogs. interesting story turned into set of cliches. Graphics is good as an RTX demo, but it is absolutely useless in gameplay reanimation. Through all of the game I never lost a feeling that someone tried to save money on this title. Want to drive a car? Sure, but there will be only ONE! Radio station in the train with just one song on a loop, really?"

Есть несколько минусов: персонаж немой, атмосфера замкнутого мира потерялась, на локациях можно практически всех людей ""уложить спать"", зато масштаб происходящего несколько увеличился. Времена года показаны замечательно, даже несколько утрированно контрастно. В общем понравилось."

My honest review of the game would be a score of 9.3. 4A games kill it with the next metro game please show these haters that you are a force to be reckoned with after all your name is 4A and you are about making 4A games not 3A like the regulars :).

В игре в игре есть посыл, который можно понять, только действовав в игре так, как ты бы действовал в жизни, также игра наглядно показывает, что максимально плохое может произойти в нынешней России, как в государстве, а самое великое в игре это соундтрек, особенно ""race against fate"", эта композиция просто самая великая композиция в мире, благодаря которой в игре самая драматичная концовка из всех существующих в кино или играх, из минусов в игре много багов и неидеальный геймплей, ещё плохая анимация персонажей(ну тут разрабам просто денег не дали), но всё это меркнет на фоне остальных заслуг игры, 95-97/100 минимум.

Игра может не запуститься или зависнуть при выходе в меню, кроме того имеют место баги и низкая кадровая частота на компьютере, удовлетворяющем системным требованиям.

Let’s talk about the bugs , oh my god sometimes it’s unplayable, those frame rate drops  different objects constantly going in other objects. Shooting behind the edges is not accurate at all ! Gunplay isn’t good as well , sometimes it feels this game physics were based on gravity on moon because when you start running  on  uneven surface it feels like your are flying . Overall I don’t suggest the game just go read the novel  and enjoy the nice story , this game is really overrated and awfully  optimized."

I like the tactical combat, hated the fake morality system and ending it's tied to. I enjoyed the Caspian and Volga open worlds but they were fairly shallow as far as side missions and exploration. The last level was classic metro as were the first levels. But the filler levels of cannibals, forest etc could have been skipped, adds little to nothing. The obnoxious predictable ""taking away all your weapons"" to introduce garbage other ones, ugh The cringey dialogue and mandatory stuff that went along with it was really bad. Dumb characters and story overall. STILL has bugs today but the crashing seems to be patched up, if you still have that the answer is usually to turn off aa and turn most things down. I didn't really get into the replaying levels much after finishing kinda boring. SLOW loading times. Map system sucks. Boat mechanics are garbage, the mighty commando can't swim I guess and it's very frustrating to find where you can get off the boat in some levels.-DLC 1 is just an extended cutscene with some flamethrower combat, almost could just be a free dlc of cut from the main game flashback etc-DLC 2 is actually pretty good. This is where you can see the garbage that the ""map"" mechanic is, when you have to go online to find where to go then you have failed game design. Terrible boat mechanics are also highlighted in this one."

I can't even follow target with mouse. Gameplay is terrible, because of that... Story is fine and voice acting is good. Ofc amazing graphics, even around objects there is grain or something and fire looks terrible! Level design could use improvement and stealth is ridiculous. You walk 1 m from him and he doesn't see you? It is honestly my fault, i chosen highest difficulty. But i had no idea it will be that awful. I played previous metro on highest difficulty fine... Ai is completely oblivious to you 90% of time and than they insta one shot kill you... I would have to start over by the time i realized that, so annoying. My sniper doesn't hit guy, when directly aiming at him, but he kills me on 100m with shotgun through 10 cm hole mkay... I don't know why we get so much high input lag games today, worse than in 2000. I guess it's terrible optimization... This game is terrible even on medium difficulty and level design is bad and bugged.

903,BeeSting1,"Jan  1, 2021",7,"Would've been amazing, but some flaws hold it back. The Good - so much natural dialogue. Adds life to crew - dialogues with Anna are deep and gives you a deeper connection with her and your future above metro - a lot of extra optional dialogue and cutscenes that playout regardless if you're there or not making the environment feel alive, especially with life on the train. - your char is very vulnerable - you are very weak. It's realistic. You can get tired from sprinting a bit - you can choose to sit down and sometimes and listen to some lore. - variety of locations, with different weather and elements - you gain parts by taking mushrooms, but you lose light. Interesting trade-off. - the mutants are really well done. Some of the sea creatures are really nasty looking. - Ending wraps things up nicely. The Bad - hit detection is **** Enemy can be peeking behind cover with your reticule right over them. But it won't hit. - artyom has no voice, despite having monologues during loading screen - not having dialogue makes him feel like a shell - if you kill someone with a crossbow from far away, and other enemies see their comrade die, they automatically know where you are despite you being out of sight - you can be not in line of sight of opponent and they will still see you sometimes - enemies can be extremely difficult to spot sometimes especially if they have camo because there is no indicator or outline of their char model - tall grass and bushes do nothing in this game. Enemies will still see you if they've already spotted you. - the accent is very heavy, making it hard to understand if you aren't familiar with Russian accent english - some enemies sound like they are right next to you, but they're actually pretty far away. - checkpoints should be placed better. There should be a checkpoint right before are radioactive exploration area, and not a checkpoint while you're exploring are radioactive area. Because if you run out a filters and have not enough stuff to craft more then you are guaranteed to die. And if your checkpoint is one minute before you run out then you're screwed. - scripted boss fights are the worst. And the second mutant bear boss fight is just that. Worst part is that there's a believer with the lights behind it that makes you think you need to use it, but you can't. You have to damage the boss a lot then take damage purposely to trigger a cutscene, to end the fight."

906,Aerokiller,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"A breath of fresh air, amid the suffocating dominance of tasteless, boring, tolerant and soulless games of our time.The finale of a great story about faith, hope, perseverance, loyalty and Love. Yes, who did not understand - this story is not about survival in a post-apocalyptic world, not about mutants, not about murder, but about something completely different. I can safely call the Metro trilogy the most anti-war story in existence. It seems to me that every politician, every person who believes that ""war is cool"", everyone who invents weapons of mass destruction and especially those who are responsible for their use, simply must pass this game. Russian people, the crew of the Aurora, are shown as realistic as possible, I speak as an ethnic Russian. The game was not made in the West, so you will not see any nonsense in the form of vodka, matryoshka, kalinka-malinka and other delusional Hollywood fantasies. The main characters of Aurora, they say, act and behave as they would most likely behave in real life. So if you have never seen a real Russian from Russia, but you really want to, then this game can help you a little to see them, at least with one eye. Of course, there is a small exploitation of the Soviet theme and some caricature nuances that are not found in real life, but which were made specifically for a wide audience from different countries, for better perception and immersion, but in general, these small stereotypes are not critical and if you are an adult, an adequate person, then perceive everything correctly. However, there is one huge "" but "" - English voice acting. It's just AWFUL. The English dubbing is so unprofessional that it's just disgusting. Absolutely the whole atmosphere is lost. English voice actors who simply read out the text with a caricatured, cranberry Russian accent, absolutely do not understand what is happening on the screen. They completely misinterpret the intonation of the voice and the emotions of the characters. Because of this, the true meaning of the dialogues is completely lost. I advise you to play only with Russian voice acting and subtitles in your native language. However, do what you want. After all, judging by the local comments, many people played this game just like a shooter, absolutely not using their brain and heart. But you should know that if you passed the game with a good ending and did not cry, then you are either still a child, or just a soulless, heartless freak. Of course, I would like to mention Anna separately. dear, dear Anya...a ray of hope, an Aurora talisman, and the other half of our soul. A woman, thanks to whom, I personally, rethought the very concept of ""woman"". Away from Aurora, wherever you are, you will only be warmed by the thought that she is waiting for you back. It does not clog the ether with useless chatter, it is not a burden, it does not whine or complain. She acts on an equal footing with everyone, makes her own contribution and is ready at any moment to risk her life for the sake of her comrades-in-arms and for the sake of her beloved man. A real woman, a real feminism. More than once I asked myself the question, would I be able to go to hell like Artyom and come back for the sake of my beloved woman? And you know, yes, I would go to the very depths of hell for such a woman and for true Love. In any case, you are waiting for an unthinkable, full of suspense and danger adventure. You will meet many different people, see how the War makes people monsters that are much more terrible than those that are generated by radiation. You will see people who, despite all the madness and horror, have not lost their human form, have not lost faith, hope, kindness and humanity. You yourself will have to go through a difficult test and understand who you really are, a man or another ugly spawn of War. You will find real comrades, friends who will become a real family for you, and the decrepit Aurora will become your real home. A home where you are truly expected, loved and respected.Even if it's just a game, just a story for a few nights, but this story changed me and from now on and forever, it will remain a part of my heart, a part of my soul. ""I do not know how they will fight in World War 3, but in World War 4 they will fight with sticks and stones"" © Albert Einstein"

Объясните разработчикам, что FOV в PC играх обычно не меньше 65. А наличие 104 кнопок на клавиатуре, не означает, что надо их все задействовать и разбрасывать. Что молчаливый герой это нихрена не круто. Что битвы с боссом, завязанные на скриптах это отстой. Что плюющие противники этой самый раздражающий элемент игры.Критические и очень серьёзные баги, которые до сих пор не пофиксили. До сих пор!! Я из-за них тупо не могу играть дальше они сохраняться. А эти дауны не сделали ручное сохраните в нескольких файлах. Пришлось качать сохранения и запускать следующую главу. Потому что игра в итоге повредила все сохранения.Всратая история и атмосфера. Мир теперь выглядит как вселенная Mad Max. Ничего общего с постсоветским пространством. Отвратительное и нелогичное управление. Неудобная навигация. Чуваки стреляющие на 1.5 километра без прицела это конечно дно. Если противник не может тебя достать, он плюется, кидается и т.д. это уж совсем откравенная халтура.

910,T-Opel,"May 24, 2020",9,"I really good game, I recommend everyone tries it out! It took me a while to get into it because I felt that the dialog was cliched and voiceovers were not great, but over time the characters all grew on me. Now I am hooked. I have never played or read any of the previous books and books, but now I definitely will. The gameplay has some elements that are similar to the newer Deus Ex games, like the option to play stealthily with lethal/non-lethal takedowns, which I have really enjoyed."
911,Ming120,"Nov 13, 2019",8,"A great game with a few flaws.  The open world concept is an interesting introduction to the metro series, and is refreshing, but comes with some gameplay annoyances.  The open world itself distracts from the game, and there often isn't all that many interesting points about it to make it worth while.  Besides this, the crafting system is also a little bit silly, and the stealth aspect of the game seems half-baked at best, and outright buggy at worst.  The moral system is still as annoying as the previous game, and unfortunately, has too much of an influence on the ending. With all these points out of the way, Metro Exodus does make up for these flaws with excellent story telling, and with character development that is second to none.  It is a brilliant story-driven narrative that wraps up the metro series nicely.  There are few games out there that had me as immersed into the world as this one, and I would almost dare saying that the narrative here is among the best in gaming.  Combined with stellar graphics and sounds to boot, this is still a game that is worth playing."

Some of the story just flat out doesn't make a lot of sense to me but the stealth stuff was fun and the graphics were really great.

918,Karmazyn83,"Oct  8, 2019",6,"Metro Exodus... Yeah...what can I say. I did not like it. I did not like 1st Metro, I really, really liked Metro number 2 and had high hopes for this game. Game failed to impress me. It is so odd because overall it is a good game and it has all the ingredients of the instant classic but these ingredients are not mixed well and the whole game level design, characters and voice acting are just uninspiring. It all feels just bland, rushed at times and so, so average. Lets start with positives. Game looks good, some locations can look spectacular but others are just good. I would say that it probably is the best looking Metro game in the whole franchise. Shooting is ok, it is nothing special. Headshoting enemies is ok, always go for the headshot to conserve precious ammo. Here is one of the main problems of the game. It's design. Game forces you to do non-lethal walkethrough and to use stealth as much as you can. The problem is that stealth mechanics are clunky and AI is almost breain dead so stealth is boring and you will intentionally go loud just for variety. Game also fails to give you a proper choice of how to approach the level. If you are spotted AI will start shooting at you, if you respond with violence kiss that good ending goodbye. You will not even know that by playing the game you want you will be penalized. On my walkethrough I did not kill any of the enemies who tried to surrender. I knocked everyone out and spared all slaves but hey, surprise, surprise I got bad ending. Like WTF? This does not make any sense !!! Game choices are sooo poorly designed, you do not even know that what you are doing might negatively affect the game's ending. It is so poorly designed and so poorly telegraphed to the player. SOme dialogue option and some moments clearly defined moments and dilemmas to choose would have been so much better. Do not even start me on voice acting. It is atrocious. I have found characters so irritating, their voices so bad, old colonel, Anna's father in particular. It was awful design choice and game would be so much better with original voice acting. There was this moment in game when one of the Spartans played guitar and sang in Russian. It was beautiful and so much better fitting than some awful english voice acting. Pretend russian accent spoken in english. awful, atrocious. No, I did not like it at all ! Do not even get me started on the way developer used cut scenes. It is awful. In every big moment of the game you are not allowed to look where you want, you are not allowed to do anything, you are just passively observing and it so utterly boring. The all cool stuff, culmination of the whole level is presented to you with lazy ingame cutscene with super limited interaction - namely spamming of E button. The camera and all this cool stuff is watched not played. Game feels rushed, last two locations are much, much smaller in size. More linear and after interesting semi open world presented to us in first two locations game becomes more linear and ultimately fails its endevours of becoming the best in the series. I would place it somewhere above 1 and below 3. Not a dent on fallout series or any other open world game. Pros:- graphics- setting Cons:- semi open world does now work- tons of bugs- voice acting.- awful AI- uninspiring story- clunky stealthy mechanics- confusing morale code"
919,Steyraus,"May 18, 2021",3,"The movement is this game is a joke. You have to travel large distances and can only move as fast as a fast walk. Not to mention your charscter get stuck on stuff. It a pretty game thats badly designed. There no direction and lock on your progress everywhere with no hints.. Gun feel weak and unsatifying, not that you use them ofyen and stealth is a joke. The gamma is messed up so you cant see a thing without a light and if you use a light you get shoot , cause tje enemy sees you.."
920,Nimbus1701,"Apr 24, 2020",5,"Exodus appears to have significant technical issues even in 2020. Audio has significant problems with relative dialogue/volume and the spatial simulation of sound.  Enemies who are 100 metres away sound like they are inches away, and you have to keep turning your head to try and triangulate a source of noise. Dialogue audio is extremely poor as well, with random volumes at random distances and directions. Some people claim to have mitigated this by toggling a spatial sound setting in-game. I have had no success there, but using headphones has helped somewhat.The maps themselves experience significant clipping problems with the protagonist passing through solid objects at times. Enemies unfortunately do this a lot more, both before and after they are shot, breaking immersion. They also have tendency to shudder and shake once dead.Looking through the binoculars or scopes will reveal significant texture pop-in issues, as well as weird stop-motion animation at a distance.Weapon customisation is an interesting feature, and somewhat makes up for the limited variety of weapons.Like the previous Metro games, the background world's artwork is very good. The painted dysoptian world feels both real and plausible. The designs of both urban ruins and the wilderness have been well thought out against the human disaster that precedes all the metro games.Overall, it feels like mishmash of good literary ideas/artwork and poor technical execution.Grab it on sale, and make sure you play it after the first two Metro games."

By my opinion there should be an option to point the reason behind your score in order for other users could clear total score for non game related issues (and more, may be even to exclude bug driven scores or political influences, as for all of this could be fixed later on or not related to the game itself)"

932,Metalpizza123,"Jun 14, 2019",9,"It's a great end to the trilogy of metro games. It's fleshed out systems and great core combat are brought into a more open and semi-linear setting. The writing and characters are well realised with good acting to keep me invested. The tone is nicely controlled, never veering off course as the tension and fear slowly build up across the game. The music is kept in control with great sound design across the board, helping bring life to the environment. Some of the sections are kinda slow and force you to wait, and honestly I still think the stealth is a bit too forced if you want to get the good karma ending. Aside from that as a fan of the books and the games is a good ending to the franchise for now."
933,dabyd1304,"May 14, 2021",7,"Había cierto estepticismo cuando empezó a verse que la tercera y última entrega sería un mundo abierto. Reconozco que al principio podía verse con malos ojos si iba a tratarse del típico mundo completista donde prima la cantidad sobre la calidad, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. Si bien hay claros altibajos, lo cierto es que al final han optado por la forma que mejor podía quedarle de mundo semiabierto. Y es que para mantener la calidad, es necesario centrarse en pequeños espacios abiertos, conectados por momentos lineales donde avanza la trama. Es algo que me encantó en su día en The Witcher 2 y que aquí veo una buena similitud en cuanto a ritmo y presentación. Por todo lo demás, el juego es bastante continuista en sus puntos fuertes y debiles con Metro 2033 y Metro Last Light. Y en general los puntos fuertes siempre tienen grandes peros. Por ejemplo, es indudable que el aspecto visual es imponente. El juego de luces, de efectos y de texturas sigue una buena evolución de las dos entregas anteriores. Pero ello choca con un sistema de animaciones algo tosco y con grandes bugs, efectos visuales extraños que no sabes si son de mala calidad o se trata de glitches puntuales. Puedes estar en una conversación con otro personaje en primer plano y todo es perfecto, solo que de repente alguien roza un plato y se produce una explosion que lo teletransporta, o alguien se queda atascado en una pared, alguien dispara de fondo pero falta el sonido del arma... cosas así. Aunque el resultado es notable, los momentos donde algo te saca de la experiencia son abundantes. Pero si algo funciona en este juego por encima de todo y de todos. Algo que es la total novedad de Exodus, es la Aurora. El tren que será parte imprescindible del viaje, hogar y a la vez personaje principal entre todo el grupo de personas, no solo es una solución visual. La interacción con la Aurora es bastante similar a lo que sucedía con los campamentos de Red Dead Redemption 2. Quizá la obsesion por el detalle y las posibilidades no sean las mismas, pero la sensación que deja es muy similar. Sin duda lo mejor de la entrega."

937,Akk3d1s,"Sep 29, 2019",7,"Its quite a buggy game that can put a stain on what is otherwise a good experience. Some of bugs that really annoyed me was that at times the actions on my keyboard didn't register. For example, for a whole chapter I was unable to close my map with the default tab key. Then the next chapter I was able to do it again. During these moments you just end up smashing and clicking everything until something happens. It was really annoying. AI randomly popping in and out during scenes. One time a bunch of mutants looked like they were swimming through the air. AI in general felt weird and just not fluid enough. They will get stuck in places or just not fit through a hole because its 2 cm too small. These things really spoil the immersion. Apart from that, the game looks really, really good. Some levels just left me in awe. The art style is just gorgeous. World, characters and weapons are really nice to look at. One mission where I didn't like the characters or the world was at the Yamantau Bunker...everything there just seemed that it would have been better left out of the game. When it comes to gameplay mechanics, it doesn't feel polished like you would think a AAA game should be and I really wished they also payed more attention to this aspect of the game. Shooting feels fine, but movement and fighting with the enemies just was not satisfying enough. It felt like it was more meant to be played with stealth in mind, which I also found more fun in the end. Its not a polished high action packed shooter like doom or call of duty, but its more story driven than those titles and at times, it can really nail immersion better than most games. It could have been an 8 or even a 9, but unfortunately some bugs and clunky AI keep it from reaching its full potential. If you enjoy post apocalyptic fiction and game immersion, then this is definitely a game you should play. If you want a smooth polished call of duty like shooter, then this is not for you."

944,lord_raccoon,"Jun 29, 2020",10,"Редкий случай, когда мне хочется дать все 10 баллов игре. Конечно, не в последнюю очередь потому, что я из России и я обожаю железные дороги. В общем то и неудивительно, ААА игр, где события разворачиваются на пост-советском пространстве за последние годы вышло...ну вот метро, в общем то и все. Безусловно для СНГ игрока это уникальный опыт: все такое родное, знакомое, атмосфера - одна из сильнейших сторон этой игры. В нее вживаешься, ей веришь, ее хочется исследовать. Не в последнюю очередь благодаря замечательному лору и шикарной постановке.Многие жалуются, что игра стала хуже по сравнению с прошлыми частями, что не нужен был этот опенворлд. Честно говоря, не согласен совсем. Уход от корридорных шутеров и эксперимент с опен-ворлдом явно себя оправдал. Metro стала похожа на нечто вроде Far Cry в пост-апокалипсисе. Локации действительно не особенно богаты на живность. Но, для первой попытки - замечательно. Я с удовольствием обследовал все интересные точки на всех локациях, исследовал каждый домик, выполнил каждый квест. Решение вывести ""Метро"" из подземки, на мой взгляд, себя оправдало. Локации просто невероятные, от пустыни до тайги, от лесов до руин новосибирского метро. Безумно порадовала возможность познакомиться с вселенной ""метро"" за рамками Москвы. Очень было интересно увидеть Новосибирскую подземку. Очень хочется верить, что когда-нибудь и Петербург увидим. Сюжет уступает прошлым частям, но в любом случае держал в интриге до самого конца. Очень порадовала графика и неплохая оптимизация, 60 фпс даже на средненькой машине. Наконец, великолепный саундтрек. Идеально передает нужную в разных ситуациях атмосферу.Ну и минусы тоже есть, хотя они совсем незначительны для меня. Во-первых, звуки. Они в игре странные, иногда тишина там, где должен быть шум, иногда шум неравномерный и т.д. С озвучкой такие же проблемы, в т.ч. с ее громкостью. Некоторые актеры отыграли откровенно не очень, где-то рот говорит, а звуки не идут и т.д. Помимо прочего, реально не хватало нормального русского мата. Это же апокалипсис, выжили явно не интеллигенция. Управление явно с консолей, оно неудобное. Кто, например, придумал поставить на одну кнопку выбор снаряжения и его использование?! Столько раз из-за этого ошибки совершал. Ну и извечная проблема игры - ГГ аутист, не умеющий разговаривать. В общем целом, шикарная игра. Невероятно погружающая и атмосферная. В Новосибирской миссии настолько качественно все поставлено и сделано, что у меня в какой то момент даже в реальности заболела голова, словно сам под радиацию попал. Похожее у меня было только в одной игре -  в Walking Dead.Прошел весь Exodus на одном дыхании, это мой новый личный фаворит, за новостями о сиквеле которого я теперь слежу с искренним интересом и нетерпением."

At this point you can completely disregard any negative reviews for performance as it's running great now and really is a beautiful game.  If you haven't played the Metro series, I recommend starting at the beginning and playing all the way through.  Each game is great in it's own right and with the remasters, they hold up graphically."

Unfortunately, there are several elements that keep it from greatness. Graphics are good but not great, by far. The smallest mutant is a much greater threat than five or six human enemies armed to the teeth, and considering the excessive respawn, this means a whole lot of wasted ammo. Having characters speak with a bad English accent does not work for me. Dialogues are a pain, especially considering the frequent, long pauses between sentences, they prevent me from relating to the characters. A terribly annoying bear boss. Sections where you need a mask, with filters that burn up resources faster than a Gatling on full auto.TL;DR: Enjoyable but also flawed. Would be a 7, giving 8 to counterbalance Epic haters somewhat."

948,nitorita,"Nov 28, 2019",8,"I'm going to start by warning that you should avoid the PC version entirely. Ominous way to start a review, I know. However, there are a few game-breaking crashes that WILL make your experience absolute hell if you ever counter them, so I strongly advise NOT playing the PC version if possible. Or at least, avoid the Xbox Game Pass version and run the game with DirectX 11 and not 12. Metro Exodus was definitely an improvement over Last Light. The story seems more cohesive and knows the story it's trying to tell. I liked Exodus' improvement in graphics, greater realism, proper resource management, and better balanced difficulty. There are some oddities like super fast sprinting and over-sensitivity to fire, and some inconveniences like slow movement especially with the AI and long travel distances. But they're not a big deal once you learn to work around them. Exodus consists of several maps which are structured like arcs, each with their own story and unique features. The game really picks up and becomes incredibly fun to play once you reach the desert map, which is about halfway into the game. There are some plot holes like how Artyom is still alive for this sequel and where his daughter vanished off to. Exodus links onto the secret good ending of Last Light, which is sadly extremely difficult to acquire. If you're bothered by the disjointed connection, watch a video of the good ending to Last Light. You'll get the answer for the first plot hole but not the second--his daughter remains non-existent in Exodus. Overall, not factoring the crashes, the game deserves an 8. It does recycle gameplay from its prequels and doesn't really try to introduce anything new, but the journey itself is an enjoyable one. GAME-BREAKING CRASHESI experienced two severe crashes. One was during a part of the game where I had to transport a railcar back to base and had to change the direction of the tracks on the way there. If you crash trying to get back on the railcar, load up an earlier save and park the railcar earlier on the tracks (not near the track switch) before getting off the railcar to change the track direction. For my second crash, it is much later in the game when Artyom has to escape from some kidnappers. My entire PC would turn black and freeze and would require a hard reset. This seems to be a serious issue others have experienced as well. The only way I could get around this part of the game was to change the game to DirextX 11 and disable Hairworks. Since I'm playing the Xbox Game Pass version, I could only do this by forcefully crashing the game via the Task Manager and activating Safe Mode."

950,Superbeef,"Dec 25, 2019",3,"Metro Exodus is not a lot of fun. I'm glad it was so cheap during the recent sale. It's one of those ""hard"" shooters where you die in a couple shots, which would be more fun if this didn't mean the correct choice was always remaining in stealth. Once an enemy camp is alerted of your presence, they instantly all immediately know exactly where you are, even in pitch blackness when you can't even see them in return. Enemies could be having a loud party and you make one tiny bunny hop outside behind a brick wall and WOOP WOOP the alarm bells start ringing and the entire world opens fire on your exact location. It's stupid. This is 2019, and I think we expect a bit better. It was tolerable in the other two because they had a great atmosphere, and a great story, and even if the combat was still just as asymmetrical and broken-stealth heavy, at least you being in a subway tunnel meant you had a general idea of which direction to return fire. I even completed them on ranger difficulty because I enjoyed the games so much. But this METRO is much more open world, with tall buildings and wreckage and multiple flanking positions and packs after packs of roaming monsters that are just there to eat up your ammo and make traversing to your next objective take longer. It wasn't fun in STALKER in 2007 and it still isn't fun today. The trope of the ""silent protagonist"" has always seemed questionable to me, yeah I get that Valve does that a lot, but you really need to have interesting supporting characters to pull that off. In a *dialog heavy* game where other boring characters are repeatedly brainstorming ideas and *looking for your input* by asking direct questions, it becomes totally ridiculous. ""Atryom, go back to base and tell my dad..."" ""Artyom, what do you think our next move should be"". Over and over and over and over. Dull dialog that goes on forever but never says anything much. A more patient person, or someone new to shooters might have fun if you turn the difficulty down to 0 and just play it as a run and gun and skip all the dull story. I have better things to do with my time. 3/10"

954,RUSSELLXP,"Feb 18, 2020",7,"After 100% completion of the main game, and 100 hours spent in it, I can objectively write an opinion. The game is good for its plot and atmosphere. Shooting and graphics are also onlevel ... But lately, with the release of both DLCs, the game became broken ... sometimes even critically. Passing the game on the Ranger-Hardcore difficulty, I swore very much ... On the broken timings of the Forest Master, because of which, if he knocks you over, he won’t get up.To the broken reaction of the NPC, to the broken lanterns who don’t seem to shine, but they find you in the dark ... After all this, I went through the game for the perfect ending and for the 5th time I saw all this, and I do not regret that I spent so much time and nerves on this game ... Now I’m going to “Two Colonels” - I have already received the most problematic achievements there, so there shouldn’t be any problems (Yeah, well) In general, I advise the game, but only for atmospheric passage on difficulty not higher than average!"

956,sersimovi,"Jan 15, 2021",6,"Things I didn't like:· Detection system, sometimes you get spotted too easily· Sometimes the melee attack option doesn't pop up· Because of the previous two issues, at some point of the story it didn't make sense to keep trying to get the best ending.· Physics. Many times when you jump or jump while bumping into something, you either jump higher than normal or it feels like you're jumping on the moon.· Visual bugs throughout the whole story.· Even though I listened to most of the dialogs and enjoyed exploring I finished the main story in less than 20 hours, with an ending that left me waiting for a bit more. I really enjoyed:· The new crafting system.· Weapon customization.· Ambient and immersion in each zone is better than ever.· The story is different, more fun and dynamic because you spend most of the time outside."
957,Alodirat,"Sep 29, 2019",10,"Игра шикарна, без преувеличения, своих денег, как на пк так и на других платформах. Из плюсов могу выделить : шикарную атмосферу, отличный саундтрек, довольно непростой и интересный геймплей, красивейшую картинку запоминающихся душевных персонажей, которых ты воспринимаешь, как живых людей и сопереживаешь им, ну и конечно ""легендарный"" открытый мир на локации ""Волга"", где можно просто пройти туда куда тебя явно не звали. Из минусов я заметил только небольшие сюжетные недочеты и глупости о которых ты забываешь спустя минуту, так как они не значительны. Это первая игра которую я до конца прошел за долгие месяцы, это первая игра от которой я получил настоящее удовольствие. Всем рекомендую."
958,FrostormNidhegg,"May 31, 2020",9,"Графика - эталонная для индустрии, и в плане дизайна, и в плане технологий - текстур, шейдеров, освещения, тумана и т.д. Сюжет - комиксовый, как и в предыдущих частях, реализмом и не пахнет, но довольно интересный. Концовка эмоционально очень сильная (я на хорошую прошел). Минусы - опять в основном стелсом проходишь, ну и озвучка Мельника - я все понимаю, но там актер озвучки пафоса перебрал аж слушать тяжело. Ну и сам игровой процесс - все тебя одергивают, внимание обращают, ты ходишь как Киркоров на рынке - все сразу смотрят, окликают, прям не один из членов отряда, а суперзвезда какая-то. А в целов - отличная игра получилась. Багов только очень много, это плохо. Но в плане визуала - просто эталон, более красивых игр не видел. В целом - конечно же всем советую, один раз пройти обязательно надо."
959,Xemnuz,"Feb 27, 2021",5,"This is why one should not preorder. I love the Metro series, especially Last Light. This on the other hand is not an enjoyable experience. The voice acting is awful, the graphics are at times awful and the characters are pretty bad, the story could be interesting but the way it is played out is not good. I looked so much forward to this game and was sure it was going to be a good time, it's not. My rating has absolutely nothing to do with epicstore, purely on what the game offers, which is little, though if it was worked on for 1-2 years more I think it could easily jump 2 stars."

И я не про графику, а именно про работу геймдизайнеров. Вся эта атмосфера, локации, колоссальное внимание к деталям и мелочам. Это просто потрясающе.Персонажи (пускай и с чопорной анимацией) настолько живые, что я по пол часа не мог уйти с поездка, задерживался на посиделки и разговоры с ними.Игра проходится на одном дыхании.

965,SilverOrlov,"Feb  7, 2021",8,"An excellent game, as expected from the authors of the previous parts, which I really liked at theirs time. Good and beautiful graphics, normal music and sound, although emotionally much weaker than in the previous parts. An interesting story about a difficult path in the post-apocalypse. Interesting companions(not a no-name doll), diverse, albeit deserted landscapes. Different stories of those who are considered the villains of the game(not a simple division into black and white). Very simple but adequate craft and weapon customization. Optional, but very interesting stories that you can listen to, just being next to certain characters.I would give the highest rating, but unfortunately the game is not devoid of a number of faults that are difficult to close your eyes to for the sake of all its advantages.1) The protagonist is an emotionless mute doll. It's just idiocy and some kind of archaism. Everyone around is talking to him, giving orders, shouting, asking questions... and you are stupidly silent like a fish killed on ice. You feel like a crippled idiot. This is a huge disadvantage in fact, for a modern first-person game about such a serious plot.2) In contrast to the first - all other characters in the game overly gesticulate during conversations. Some of them are expressed during talking as some kind of pretentious book characters, and the other part - as prisoners who have just been released from prison. However, this is not so critical for the entourage, like this fierce gesticulation... it's horrific.3) Game scripts are too crooked. As the most understandable example: in one place I fought with a bear almost without receiving damage at all, at a certain moment the character's state jumped to critical(red frame on screen) when the next script started. The game, ####, decided that I had too much health at this moment.4) Long animation of doors, boats, cars, etc. which cannot be interrupted. You are slowly entering the car, examining the key... and at the same moment a crowd of zombies is running at you... great.5) From time to time it is impossible to hit the enemy with machine gun. From time to time, bullets can fly as they please. I saw no problems with the rest of the weapon though.6) Bouncing bodies. This is both funny and stupid at the same time: the game has zombies who like to sleep, the game also says that the damage to a relaxed enemy is much higher... as a result, when you throw a knife, for example, at a sleeping zombie, their dead body jumps a meter in height, damn it.7) Stealth works only on half: firing with a silencer next to someone will be heard and this is normal, but the turmoil of killing an enemy with a knife will not be particularly heard in a couple of meters.Even if only partial shade - you can't be seen, come to the back of your enemy to breathe in his ear. Even when it's dawn and logically enough light... But if you just move a little in the illuminated space, you will be seen from the other end of the map.(@) I really hate it when people say something like that: ""Sorry, I didn't tell you about this because I didn't want to bother you"" - this is not a claim to a game, but just a cry from the heart about a disgusting character's trait in people.(@) The open world did not become truly open, but it pleasantly diversified one solid sausage of the dark underground. So here 1:1....In the end, this is an excellent story, spoiled by a slightly crooked game-play and some bad mechanics."
966,jorokw,"Dec 21, 2020",9,"I like this game - no automatic compass, alternative pathes, minimal / no HUD, no enemy highlighting. Replayable (1. no alarm / 2. no kills). Nice post-apo world. Wish Fallout 5 looks like this..."

968,watertoad,"Jun 22, 2019",7,This game has much less horror elements than the previous series as they added more sunny vibe to the game which I really do not like. It is still a good game but they failed to differentiate on what is scary and what is annoying  which I see a lot in the enemies and mutants. Another minus one point for this game is the broken save file that I experience which was very frustrating. I kinda have a love hate relationship with this game but one thing for sure is that this game in terms of enemy mechanics is slightly worse than the previous series.
969,4Cyberpunk,"Jul  5, 2019",9,"Gas masks on.Metro again radiates with quality special story driven fps experience.But there was still some serious disappointment since this is third.Felt fresh all until slightly before the end.Then it was like Archives level i think from first one which would be fine if there was something more behind it.Hated it towards the end and endings.No final boss or something,really.Wish there was interaction with or something about Dark Ones.Fully action cinematic packed game and then they skimp with the ending,almost like they put a static pic with some lame narration.Booo that sucks!Thought Humanimals would just annoy me but they were actually the funniest mutants.Mutated Bear kinda sucked because he was predictable.At least Olga thought it was AWESOME hah.Game has atmosphere and maturity as always.Love Metro games."

I really enjoyed Metro Last Light when I played it ages ago, which may be a factor as I have definitely been spoiled with some amazing games in the last 6 years.  They definitely shouldn't have even done an English dubbed version as it is just terrible and completely takes you out of the game which may be why there are so many 0's."

976,Bottlecaps,"Jun 13, 2020",8,"Metro exodus is Peak metro ( like it or not and there seems to be a lot of or nots on metacritic) but i'm here to tell you dont worry this game is good and really fun , its a gritty ""realistic"" shooter that you have to take your time with is it plagued with bugs and crashes also yes , its easy to look past though when you realize how much the devs at 4 A had to go through just to get their first game out and subsequently this one Story: 1 year after the events of metro last light. artyom is determined to find someplace besides the metro tunnels alive out there when him and his wife anna ( who he marries during the time skip ) find a conspiracy to keep the people of the metro ignorant to the happenings of the outside world , artyom his wife and some members of the order are then chased out by the conspirators where they search for either a place to settle or another war to fight. artyom and anna's relationship is on full display in this game where in last light it was awkward and forced in exodus it really feels like they are in love even if artyom cant speak ( or refuses to) making things worst it feels like artyom is a man trapped in his own medium being a silent protagonist using only his hands and animations to emote , this is no different than the first 2 games but a silent protagonist is an out dated practice in this industry and id like to have him speak. the characters are far more likeable in this game , and how much time you spend with them will affect how much you like them , i think the way characters should feel is that they are all living their own lives and that's how it feels in metro exodus  even if the voice acting and animations aren't perfect they all still feel like people with a place in the world and thats niceStory: 8/10 Worldbuilding: i was a little disappointed with the world building in exodus , this is a game of small open worlds where people have their own way of life, the metro is the survivors of the old world , the icy lakes ruled by bandits and a cult , the desert dunes rampaged by violent tyrants and slavers and the forest of tribal elementary school students led by a teacher who believed he failed them each little open world has its own secrets , lore , and characters , my problem with this is that it feels episodic with the train folks stories being somewhat in the background , i don't think this kind of story telling works for metro and it makes the whole world feel a little choppy even if each world individually feels good , it would be fine in a standalone game or a different series all together but it just feels out of place in metroWorld building7/10 Graphics: MUCH improved , feels like a new engine all together this game looks great even on lower settings (until you get to certain textures) again its not perfect but looks far better than the previous games , its just glitchy , this game is mired with bugs graphical and otherwise , iv crashed a few times and had to use save scumming to get through certain areas without crashes , this games ambition is outside the reach of its tech.Graphics: 7.3/10 Gameplay: this game is a joy to play , its slow and methodical you really have to pick your next move carefully on harder difficulties  using stealth and the element of surprise rather than just going in guns a blazing. your weapons are your tools  and need to be upkept or else they will jam in the middle of a fire fight a mechanic that only far cry 2 has even dared to try ( i like it though makes fire arms feel like well firearms) and each gun in this game behaves differently even the similar ones , the AK47 is fast firing and fairly accurate but compared to the bulldog witch fires slower but is far more accurate even if they are both automatic assault rifles they are different, enemies react to what you do , try to counter everything is situational and the enemies will react , sometimes its not about being a step ahead but being 4-5 steps ahead or being so far ahead they don't even see you , this game gives you a lot of freedom to approach situations in how ever you see fit, the problem is it is very buggy.Gameplay:9/10 Sound design: the voice acting as iv mentioned is decent , sometimes it is awkward and i think mo cap would have helped immensely here ( yeah it's expensive i know why they didn't do it) all the animations feel hand animated rather than an actor's performance witch i really think could have helped the acting but i digress minor gripe all things considered. the sound effects are wonderful though , explosions , and gun shows ring out in echos and sound crisp and satisfying ESPECIALLY the bulldog assault rifle even when a gun is silenced it still sounds crisp and satisfying.Sound design: 8.2/10 8+7+7.3+7.2+9+8.2= 39.539.55= 7.9"

Gráficamente un titulo sobresaliente del los que ya no se ven en medio de tantos monigotes de colores, flojea un poco en las partes narrativa y jugable, pero solo por verlo merece la pena.

983,DarkGames,"Jun 11, 2019",10,"Одна из лучших игр в которые я играл, с учётом того что играю уже больше 5 лет. Хочется отметить отличную графику, прекрасный геймплей (особенно доставили рюкзак и крафт), а также интересный сюжет и конечно прекрасный саундтрек и озвучку.Ну и недостатков она не лишена конечно, но куда же без этого, заранее извиняюсь, но и Дикая охота их не лишена если уж на то пошло, однако обе эти игры прекрасны. Я только что закончил проходить Metro: Exodus и признаюсь в конце мне стало откровенно страшно перед обезьянами (я в курсе, что их называют библиотекарями, читал книгу, но даже если это их новосибирская версия то я всё равно буду называть их ""обезьяны""), мне и первой игре было очень сложно проходить уровень в Великой библиотеке, а потом... А потом я чуть не заплакал, настолько грустна здесь плохая концовка, а прошёл именно на неё, т. к. проходил как попало по типу:""Ой, меня спалили, что же мне делать?Хм... А может перезапустить уровень? Не, лень. Пускай так будет""Теперь хочу сказать одно: ЛЮДИ ВЫ СОВСЕМ С УМА СОШЛИ ЧТО-ЛИ?!? Неужели такую хорошую игру можно угробить лишь из-за того, что её издатели решили, что выгодней будет уйти из Steam с его 36% комиссией (заранее извиняюсь если инфа неправильная, но по сути так всё и есть) и перейти в Epic Store с комиссией 12%? Я просто не понимаю неужели некоторые настолько ленивы что не могут залезть интернет и создать аккаунт? Цена та же самая, что вам не нравится?P.S. Я прекрасно понимаю что тавтологии в этом тексте полно, прошу простить, сейчас меня просто переполняют эмоции, а в крови шкалит адреналин и потому не могу нормально думать."
984,VirtualForce,"Jun  6, 2019",9,"Exceptional game, has loads of everything. Gameplay is fun, choose your style but lends itself a bit more to slight stealth, but not a must. You can go all guns blazing if you want.Looks gorgeous! The graphics really adds so much to the game, one moment you'll be walking in a sunlit, hot area and the next gusts of wind sweeps in, bringing dust and a somber feeling with it. Lighting throughout the game makes me want to get a RTX card, my GTX 1060 did a great job though.The story, is also great, its not going to win a Oscar, but its not soap opera crap, nice to have and follow, perhaps a little silly with some of the conversations.Character models are excellent! Seeing Anna again made me fall in love!Overall, besides the DRM move from STEAM to EPIC store crap, it's a great game, don't miss this game because of the DRM thing.The only little downside, is the weapons that deteriorate, but you can keep them clean, plus, you have never stressed until a big enemy charges you and your weapons jams, forcing you to reload. It never really made me want to stop playing, just remember to keep your guns clean."
985,GoodMorningAss,"Aug 21, 2020",9,"Let's not hide the intrigue and not repeat in large numbers. The game is gorgeous, its most juice is the atmosphere. The post-Apocalypse in the realities of Russia is elegantly implemented: colorful characters (appearance, speech, behavior), atmospheric locations in different areas of the ""vast"", with different local characteristics. The crew of our train worked well, but they need time to reveal (at the beginning of their appearance was stunned, compared to the faceless Spartans and Ullman).BUT the whole game I did not let go of a certain feeling, as if something is missing. And so the end of the game and the city of Novosibirsk gave me what I wanted!The atmosphere of despair and severe lack of time, constant failures of weapons, dark tunnels, pressing their vaults, hallucinations and ""mysticism"", as well as terrible mutants (and I'm not talking about kikimor and ghouls, but really creatures that cause FEAR, it seems the feeling was in the first part). That spirit at the end really got to my bones, that's what I wanted most. Incredible experience!"

989,Z3ros,"Jun 23, 2019",4,"Esto ya no es un Metro, la historia es pasable. Lo peor son los fallos técnicos, si no tienes un SSD, los tiempos de cargo se miden en minutos, la sensación de disparar es horrible, me recuerda al metro 2033 original, las modificaciones de las armas no parecen que hagan nada, la sensación de movimientos de Artyon se nota tosca y pesada. En conclusión, si no lo comparar con cualquier otro metro es un juego meriocre, y si lo comparas con metro es una basura"

991,ignition2k,"Jul  6, 2019",9,"In a age of cheap content, knock offs and microtransactions plague, Metro Exodus manages to keep a worthy sequel to it's previous Metro titles. Whether it's a great stealth combat or amazingly crafted cutscenes, the original stories... Metro really does feel like a post apocalyptic game, unlike it's modern competitors.Small thing to improve the game: Set the dub to Russian and subtitles to English for best experience, as the English dub feels like a cheap anime dub."
992,MarcoRegueirad,"Jun 30, 2019",10,"Fantastic game, a perfect end to the story. Played it on a 1440p and it looks amazing!Makes me wanna read Dmitry Glukhovsky's books."
993,Spineapple,"Jul  3, 2019",3,"Being a massive fan of both the previous games I had a high hopes for Exodus. Besides the standard average optimisation of a Metro game, and the few bugs I’ve encountered, there are still a lot of other otherwise fairly minor issues with the game, that when added together sadly make this a pretty disappointing edition to an otherwise solid series. The biggest problem is one that really makes or breaks an FPS game: weapons. Not only do they feel ridiculously clumsy to use, they also"
994,KepleR67_,"Jul 14, 2019",2,"- AI is pathetic. I have gone from being half a metre away from a turkey and not detecting myself or from being far away and super hidden and being detected by all the enemies in the area. The most pathetic thing is surrender. I've gone from killing 3 men, staying 4 alive and having me surrounded and surrendering all 4 at once. Then, in addition, to go out to another zone and see 2 enemies more arms in high - Artyom's movement is slow, clumsy and feels of the past generation. I don't think it's normal that in a 2019 game you get caught in a pixel that protrudes from a branch of a tree, or that you get close to a fence or wall, you jump and in the middle of the jump you put the animation of a step off. Or worse, don't hook the movement to the first one and you have to jump 2 or 3 times to be caught by the climb. In that sense it is very outdated. I'd also like to know which genius came up with the same button to duck as to collect ammunition from weapons. It's great to be covered, want to take bullets from a corpse next to you, don't catch the action and stand up, making A-dies if you're in a B-fire- you get caught. - The story doesn't hold up, nor does it have a head or a foot, especially because of the way certain situations are presented to you. It is not normal that in the part of the sect, you enter the church as if it were a cinema with everyone watching and 30 seconds later you are hostile to everyone for no apparent reason, when you have been shot 3 seconds before helpless from a boat. Miller doesn't make sense, it goes from wanting you to die to helping you 3 times in each encounter with him. The inhibitors are ridiculous. - The behavior of the allies is so cutrísimo, again belongs to the last generation. Those infinite conversations are a pain in the ass, you walk away from one who is giving you the badge and you look from afar and keep talking to you. Also, as I say the conversations are a pain in the ass and very chaotic, there can be 2 or 3 conversations at the same time, making you not know anything. - The sound is MALISIMO. The weapons that sound like toys are joined by a 3D sound, no matter how much atmosphere I say it has, non-existent. The audio mix is painful, and the sound controller can't fix it. It can't be that being next to an npc, you don't hear him just because the ambient sound is heard more. It's been years since I had to put the subtitles to find out something. - Of graphics I don't see it SO pointer. I play it on an Xbox One X with a NU8005 55"", calibrated meniculously and the game looks BAD. The HDR is implemented like the ass. The gamma slider is rotary. The textures are some really good and some really bad. The facial modeling is very bad, the faces are not bad, but they are very inexpressive and in the secondary characters the faces are very bad. Also the lighting on the faces is very dull, and in a game where there are so many cinematic characters in the foreground is lost a lot of quality. I won't compare it to RDR2, the faces of Crysis 3 or Mass Effect 3 are much better. The rest, which is the lighting, particles, polygonal charge, etc because the same thing, there are very good moments and other very bad ones. - It has TOO many cinematic scenes, and the worst thing is that they are almost all scenes without any interest and quite badly performed and repetitive. Situations that you're controlling your game and suddenly something happens and you stay as ""but let me control the **** everything to end up with Artyom being saved to the limit by an npc that grabs his arm, either underwater, when hitting a jump or fall somewhere. - I don't think the atmosphere is half as good as 2033 and Last Light. In short, a game very outdated in the playable that has been given an injection of graphics and a fist of open world and crafting and track. I hope it gets better but I think it's the first big disappointment of the year."

1004,SuperCritic3000,"Apr 24, 2020",8,"Ну что сказать... Перепройдя ее спустя год, но уже с DLC, можно сказать, что игра заслуживает вашего времени и внимания. При первом прохождении положительных впечатлений было гораздо больше, но на то оно и первое. В целом игру рекомендую, есть конечно много косяков, но и хорошего тоже немало. Отдельно хотел бы обратить внимание на парочку минусов и плюсов. Начну с минусов. 1. Научите же Артема уже говорить - сидеть и терпеть ""нужные"" и одновременно нудные для сюжета диалога просто невозможно. К примеру, герои DLC говорить умеют и игровой процесс это меняет в гораздо лучшую сторону.2. Боевка просто мрак, монстры, которые перед атакой ""зависают"" на секунду-две, просто выбешивающие враги со встроенным аимом, которые попадают по тебе из каждого угла, в то время как ты в них так попасть не можешь (а опыт шутеров у меня ого-го) и прочее. Касаемо плюсов. 1. Конечно же атмосфера. Атмосфера всей серии передана отлично, в том числе благодаря проработанным и интересным локациям - будь то тяжелая Волга, солнечный Каспий, напоминающая детство Тайга или ужасающий Новосибирск. Также хочу отметить Владивосток из DLC, играя в котором, поневоле очень часто вспоминаешь серию STALKER.2. Крафт оружия. Крафт реализован очень круто, куча вариаций модификаций, которые могут переводить оружие из одного класса в другой, не могут не доставлять удовольствия в процессе игры. В целом, поставив 9 после первого прохождения, и поставив 7 после второго, средняя оценка получается 8. У игры есть как сильные, так и слабые стороны, однако, если бы у меня спросили стоит ли в нее играть, я бы скорее всего ответил ""Да""."

1013,geostigma,"Nov 16, 2019",9,"Where do I even start? Should I even mention that this game looks stunning? Do I say how good the shooting feels?Honestly, I could talk about all of the ups in the Metro Exodus for a while but I'll just keep it short and say that this is pure, hardcore gaming. No hand holding or quest markers. The game respects you as a player and allows you to make your own decisions and carry them out the way you want and is not afraid to punish your for not planning things out or trying to rush it. For the first time in a very long time, I felt like I was actually playing, actually exploring and experiencing the world around me, taking in the sights, doing recon, preparing and planning in advance rather than just mindlessly following the pointer to the next objective. I felt like paying attention was rewarded and that it mattered! Sure, it's not perfect but it's amazing for what it is and I can't recommend this hybrid adventure/shooter/stealth game enough and if you're giving it a negative score because of Epic then shame on you for bashing a small game studio. The only thing that's keeping it from getting 10/10 from me are some bugs and performance inconsistency. P.S. It is available on Xbox Game Pass for 1€/month"
1014,StupidBethesda,"Dec 18, 2019",2,"I want to like this game, i really do.. but there is just alot wrong with the game here. I only got it recently and don`t care about the fact it's on epic. The game just has an even more budget feel than the previous metro games and looks like it is taking itself seriously while i just cannot anymore. The first 2 hours of play was just having the game crash and freeze constantly even though it's been out for months now. The AI is a joke, it is definitely artificial but by no stretch of the imagination intelligent. The thing that I just cannot stand is the idea of having a single save file!! If you get stuck somewhere and the game just decides to save over your only save file.. you're screwed. better restart your last 2 hours of gameplay have fun! in 20 hours of game time I've gotten stuck on scenery at least 30 times already, screw boats and tunnels, some abysmal game design choices a four year old could have told you was a bad idea.. I could go on and on about more problems i have but these outline my personal gripes with the game so far, don't even know if I want to finish the game if it will not allow me to explore at my own pace without punishing me for it. TL;DR: If you want a good metro experience, don't play this game. I quit before i finished because I felt i was fighting the game more than the enemies and am more annoyed than i am having fun."

1017,Muzzy,"Nov  9, 2019",6,"It is a beautiful looking game with a good story. I liked the emptyish open world because I imagine that is what a nuclear wasteland looks like, and the view was always amazing. There was plenty of time to be spent underground and get jumped by nuclear mutant spiders or whatever. You won't like this if doom is your favorite game. You need to sneak around everyone to get the good ending. It is also a reasonably buggy game, with some crashes and things to laugh at, but I don't think it is enough to ruin it. There isn't much else to say. It's a pretty looking metro game thats half open world. 6/10"
1018,Maturedumbass,"Dec 25, 2019",8,"Метро Исход- игра от наших для наших с огромным пластом проблем, но игра мне понравилась и я готов ее похвалить, но начну с минусов.1) Не самый лучший открытый мир.

Most recently, after just trying to alter my video presets the game crashed and took 10 minutes to get it back up and running. My only real issue as far as the gameplay is that I was getting an inordinate amount of no reg shots. Otherwise it was all stability and glitches. Thankfully I'm playing it on game pass; so I don't have to feel obligated to play it. Some may like it, and i've enjoyed the story thus far, I just dont know if i can bring myself to finish it with its various issues."

1024,potwor1991,"Apr  7, 2020",9,"Wow man, what a game. I jumped into this not knowing what to expect, as I didn't read any of the books, or played any of the previous games and i must admit, that I'm blown away. Gameplay-wise it's something between Fallout and Farcry with more emphasis on survival, so if you liked any of those games (excluding F76 ofc. hehe) you should like this one. Visuals are stunning, great attention to detail, some really realistic looking scenes and textures, you can really feel that eastern European atmosphere. What really got me though, was the story and characters. I don't think I've been this interested in plot and attached to the crew since last Witcher and by the end it's a real trip. All that is not even considering any of the DLC's which I heaven't even touched yet. The whole thing took me about 35 hrs. on normal difficulty, so you also get your money's worth in that department. I really can't recommend this game enough! I'm only giving it a 9, instead of 10 due to a couple of minor visual bugs and maybe 2 hard crashes, so it's not perfect, but it's damn close imo."

1031,KarolP,"Jan 25, 2021",8,"Metro Exodus is full of contradictions. Firstly, it is definately different that two previous games of franchise. It brings Metro from claustrophobic locations to semi-open world. It is not that dirty, cruel, atmospheric as it was before, but still memorable. On the other hand, there are moments, when you wouldn't have any doubts - it is old Metro, still can be terrifing and atmospheric, but not through almost whole game. Enemies aren't as horrible as mutants. For example, the part of the game on the desert looks rather like Rage, not Metro, but last stages whilst looking for a medicines are terrifing and mind blowing as it was before. Created world is beautiful and dangerous. Maybe tunels and some interiors looks more like in Last Light, but views are amazing, truly outstanding. Animations and character models also aren't that remarkable. The diversity of landscapes is admirable. Through whole game you'd be able to experience four seasons, various of vistats, like in few different games. System requirements are quite high, optimalization should be a little bit better, but it is not that bad as spoken. Audio is generally good (but not each of english voice actors), but I missed memorable theme songs or typical sounds like from 2033 or Last Light. Silent protagonist is more irritable than before. He's able to speak during loadings (which are too long by the way), but not to his wife or comrades. There should be some dialogue choices in game, when is so much narration. Ofc it is FPS game, but with plenty of narration, sneaking and exploring. Another anoying issue is the morality system, which affects ending. It is too hard to get good ending. I wasn't killing my enemies (when I had a choice) mostly all the time and still didn't get the good one. It starts to be about stealth and sneaking, but as far as I remember we all expect atmospheric shooter. Moving back to advantages, campaign has really reasonable duration, many missions are interesting, crafting is simple and not annnoying, workshop and weapons mechanics connecting are nicely made. Gunplay is satisfing. Game itself is quite challenging. Last stages were terrefic (I mean frightening) and moving for me, that was what I expected. I don't give a damn thing about Denuvo or Epic exclusiveness, I reviewed a game, not someone's policy and it is a piece of solid shooter with interesint campaign. Worthly expierince for a single player, finally."

1035,gabridarj,"Jan 12, 2020",7,"Me ha gustado el juego, la historia y los personajes. Glujovski ha creado otra fascinante aventura de Artyom. Llegando al ámbito personal, me ha parecido innovador la idea de sacar a Artyom y a sus compañeros de Moscú, pero esta aportación ha llevado al juego a tener algunos errores. El sonido en las acciones y en el juego en general me ha parecido mal producido (enemigos que se acercan y no se oye, que un enemigo te ataque y no haya sonido apenas...); y otro aspecto que me ha parecido mal ejecutado han sido los escenarios: zonas del mapa vacías, escasa interacción con el terreno, vehículos necesarios pero con fallos...; y para finalizar, un fallo de optimización que me ha ocurrido a mí, he podido jugar el juego en calidad media y mi gráfica debería haber sido suficiente para jugarlo en esta calidad entero, pero he tenido que bajarlo a veces porque daba tirones bastante notables.En conclusión quitando estas cositas me ha parecido un buen juego, a pesar de que es molesto de jugar a veces.  Lo recomiendo para los jugadores de la saga, pero me gustan más los anteriores."

1038,SipderMun,"Jan 21, 2020",7,"Должен сказать, что минусы, которые я привожу, выстраданы мной на собственном опыте, так как я провёл за игрой 85 часов. Не вижу смысла затягивать, итак, плюсы: +Отличная атмосфера. Постоянная напряженность от того, что стало с миром и с людьми. Для русских людей эта игра ещё более атмосферна, все эти старые вещи, речь и многое другое. А Новосибирск так вообще нечто.+Хороший сюжет. Мне тут нечего комментировать, вы и сами всё понимаете.+Неплохая графика. К сожалению я не имею возможности понаблюдать RTX на своём экране, но впринципе графика достойная.+Оружие. Его много, оно красивое и оно не чувствуется как бамбуковая палка.+Два Полковника. Очень душевное дополнение, было бы оно ещё длиннее, чем урок в школе, цены бы ему не было. Этих плюсов не много, но они достаточно весомые, чтобы я не возненавидел эту игру из-за её минусов, а они, поверьте мне есть и не малые. -Анимация персонажей. Когда игра только вышла всеми признана была плохая анимация персонажей и их лиц. Разработчики прислушались и сделали её ещё хуже, теперь у персонажей двигаются ещё и зубы. Люди так не говорят...-Оптимизация. Это просто ужасно на самом деле, но не настолько сильно печалит низкий фпс , сколько постоянные вылеты. Я не могу посчитать сколько игра у меня вылетела.-Автосохранения. Из-за этого минуса я решил прервать прервать очередное прохождение и забыть про эту игру до выхода истории Сэма. Сохранение может не проходить полчаса, а сохраниться в каком-то непонятном рандомном месте. Причём на сложности хардкор нельзя сохраниться в ручную (что решило бы проблему). Проблема достигает своего апогея в долине, так как убивать детей леса нельзя вообще, приходится перезагружаться, а как перезагружаться если чтобы начать заного надо протоптаться 3 минуты, пока добежишь до места, пока послушаешь болтовню, пока ползком не повырубаешь некоторых, после чего тебя видят сквозь стену и ваншотят, так как в отчаянии пытаешься вырубить противника, а этого просто по какой-то причине нельзя сделать. Разработчики не собираются это чинить, это понятно.-Артём. Я не могу понять почему он молчит, полковник Хлебников вполне хорошо говорит и это не выглядит странно, а Артём молчит, его спрашивают - он молчит, с ним ругаются - он молчит, шутки рассказывают - он молчит, жена кровью кашляет - он молчит, его хотят пришибить палкой - молчит и показывает пальцем. У Артёма даже актёр озвучки есть, вы что там делаете вообще? В итоге хочу сказать, что я не разочарован покупкой игры и не жалею времени, потраченное на неё. Но эти минусы... Остаётся надеяться, что следующая часть не повторит этих ошибок."

1045,fredblack,"Jun 10, 2020",7,"I rate it seven but,but maybe I give it with too much grace,maybe six would be much better. I feel that the Exodus has provided exactly the opposite that the previous Metro games has provided:the previous Metros had a very exciting world with interesting,creative details,but the game mostly was simply unplayable without watching helping youtube videos,and they were also filled with bugs. Exodus on the other hand is the other extreme: i played it,with watching youtube only for a few times,and there are not much bug. However the world is very boring,it does not provide intresting places,the side quests are simple and boring,and are not separated from the main story line,which makes the open world of the game very shallow and empty.  (Although it is a bit less true,for the Volga,but still,I did not found it creative engough.) I fell that the developers were not able to deicide wheter or they wanted to create bit CODlike FPS or a Fallout game,and the problem that sometimes we cannot too. Story:It is okay,not the best,but it was totally acceptable for me.Gameplay:sometimes frustrating,but mainly OK. However it is a serious problem that the game does not really teach how to use things,like map,electric instrument panel,air gun etc.Graphics: I played it with GTX1050Ti and it was quiet good."
1046,BattleSquid,"Feb 20, 2020",10,"Great atmosphere and shooting mechanics. The game draws multiple subtle parallels between current post-Soviet space (where everything Soviet has fallen into disrepair) and a post-apocalyptic setting. There is also a rich sense of nostalgia. I love the take on nature in this episode, both in terms of environments and monsters, be it giant crayfish, catfish, sea-cucumber-esque slugs, or moles (all giant, naturally). I wasn't a fan of the Yeti at the end, though, which are the old gorilla 'librarians' brought back - they could have thought up a separate cool monster for the Novosibirsk surface. There are multiple limitations, such as open world maps being small, yet they are well-crafted, or the overly exaggerated hyperboles that get racial or political at times or seem too implausible. However, if you understand what the authors attempted to achieve with the resources they had at their disposal, instead of looking for something you yourself wanted, then you'll enjoy it as the masterpiece that it is, with great mechanics, engrossing environment, and a deep and meaningful message."
1047,ZeroSOFAD,"Feb 26, 2021",7,"Атмосфера в игре потрясающая. Графика отличная. Радует разнообразие локаций. Но из минусов то, что игра реально короткая и эти различные концовки, о которых ты сможешь узнать только из инета, сам до этого никогда не догадаешься в процессе игры."
1048,DerekDong,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"Overall great game in an intriguing setting of post-apocalyptic Russia OBVIOUSLY being on EGS has nothing to do with the game quality and playability, shame that people rate it low because of that. Good parts:- Fleshed-out characters that you end up really caring about, this time with great voice acting, engaging storyline, amazing worldbuilding- Nice guns & mods as well as the gunplay itself, usually several ways to get to the objective- Also this time each chapter does not end with the protagonist getting knocked out - a great improvement compared to the previous game. Bad parts:- Unskippable dialogue that takes up like 25% of the game. I get it, the writer of the game is the writer of the book and that's what he does but it is really annoying to listen to all the **** everyone has to say and decreases replayability for me significantly- We also don't get to see a lot of events that are set up (liberation of slaves in the desert, contamination of the valley, etc)- Open-world is not really open. I don't mind, but why would you advertise it as such then- Also, in the previous two games mystic stuff took a big part of the world (due to the protagonist's connection to the dark ones). In this game, however, it is completely abandoned (maybe for the best), except for when you are fighting the spiders - then your flashlight mysteriously stops working due to no reason whatsoever.- Also also, Anya in the previous game was this badass sniper warrior, here she is basically a damsel in distress and a pain in your ass - what a shame- Also also also, the protagonist still does not talk aside from loading screens, while it is hinted that he talked to the characters behind the scenes. So he is not mute then? Why would he not respond to numerous radio calls from his worried friends? Is he just really anxious when we are playing as him? Wierd choice from previous games is continued here In conclusion - it is an exciting journey through destroyed Russia with great story & good gameplay that almost never takes you out of what's going on. A must-play for the genre and / or series fans. Cheers."

1051,Eireecos,"Jun  9, 2020",10,"An absolute blast of a game! The atmosphere in Metro Exodus is amazing and combined with the stunning graphics and the ever so great soundtrack by Alexey Omelchuk, I just can’t help but get immersed in ways and layers I haven’t experienced in a long time. I loved the semi-open world level design and have to commend how distinct and unique each level was. I liked the new crafting system, allowing for better customization of my loadout according to my playstyle. The story, although paced down in comparison with previous installments, was still really good and the characters more likable and fleshed out. The only shame is, that there wasn’t more of it and there weren’t more opportunities to improve relations with your crew and to help them on your journey. I played Exodus after its Steam release, and have to say that my game was running very smoothly and bug-free. For me the game is a real gem of gaming industry and playing it puts you on an emotional rollercoaster. Yes, it’s somewhat different from the two previous games, but it still was extremely enjoyable for me and I loved every second of it."
1052,dmcrun11,"Mar 30, 2020",2,I really wanted to like this game after having thoroughly enjoyed my experience in the first Metro game. After having played Exodus for about 10 hours I have decided to stop playing the game and uninstall it. When I was a kid my mother told me that is perfectly fine to quit reading a book if the story line isn't entertaining you. Exodus' story was horrible and I was not invested in any of the characters at any time. The gameplay felt clunky. The AI was absolutely horrible (think 2003 AI). There was never a satisfying moment of gameplay. This game felt more like a chore than a pleasurable gaming experience. Disappointed.

В игре присутствуют две концовки, которые зависят от вашего стиля игры (что я считаю плохим решением). Проработка персонажей (кроме протагониста), атмосфера, диалоги (скорее монологи, тк главный герой молчит всю игру) и проработка персонажей (опять кроме Артема) - шикарны. С технической точки зрения у игры не все  так гладко: страдает ии, огромное количество багов и тд. Графика - не 2019 год, но атмосфера и арт - дизайн компенсируют все с лихвой. В игре есть несколько локаций, некоторые имеют некоторое подобие открытого мира. Саундтрек и озвучка - прекрасны. Кастомизация оружия интересная, в наличии много обвесов, получаемых из разобранного вражеского оружия и выполнения сайд - квестов. Надеюсь на продолжение этой серии видеоигр. Объективная оценка - 8 (с учетом всех недостатков), моя личная - 9 (это моя любимая игра)."

1063,Alexb1096,"Jul 24, 2020",10,"ITALIAN:Un gioco magistrale, perfetta prosecuzione e conclusione della serie. AUDIO E GRAFICA:Molti elementi sia sonori che grafici sono presi dai vecchi capitoli, anche per creare continuità, ma erano e continuano ad essere di buon livello. Tutto ciò che è nuovo è davvero molto curato, con paesaggi bellissimi e dettagliati. Buono anche il comparto audio, con un eccellente doppiaggio italiano (tutti i personaggi tranne il protagonista secondo me sono doppiati meglio di quanto lo siano in inglese, quasi al livello del doppiaggio russo).La colonna sonora invece riprende quella del resto della serie ma è resa ancora più cupa. Nota dolente è l'espressività dei volti, che spesso rovina l'ottimo lavoro dei doppiatori e degli sceneggiatori. Vista la grandezza del gioco avrei preferito vedere una maggiore cura in questi aspetto (c'è riuscito Hellblade con un team di 20 persone).Inoltre a volte si nota il cambio di animazione nei personaggi anche in sequenze scriptate e che quindi potevano essere facilmente corrette. Ho giocato senza RTX attivato, ma già così l'impatto generale è ottimo, peccato per quei piccoli bug che rompono l'immersione nel gioco. GAMEPLAY:I precedenti capitoli si svolgevano quasi interamente all'interno delle galleria della metropolitana di Mosca, con qualche uscita all'aperto utilizzando la maschera antigas. Questo titolo stravolge l'ambientazione e di conseguenza il gameplay ma lo fa senza snaturare l'atmosfera, rendendo il gioco perfettamente in linea con il resto della serie.In Metro Exodus infatti, salvo un breve inizio a Mosca, ci porterà in un viaggio lungo la Russia, passando per vari paesaggi, vedendo passare le stagioni e incontrando molti personaggi.È facile capire come buona parte del gioco sia all'aria aperta, all'interno di macro aree esplorabili liberamente.La cosa che più ho apprezzato è proprio la presenza di questo tipo di mappe, molto grandi ma con diversi punti notevoli ed obiettivi, alcuni principali ed altri secondari. È stato inoltre aggiunto un sistema di crafting che permette di cambiare accessori alle armi e creare qualche oggetto consumabile. Il sistema è davvero semplice ed intuitivo, ma forte troppo potente e rende l'aspetto survival meno presente, oltre ad una maggiore frequenza di munizioni e filtri rispetto ai giochi precedenti.Ho apprezzato molto come il gioco non cerchi troppo di nascondere la propria natura di videogioco, rendendo veloci e intuitivi passaggi che nella vita reale richiederebbero più tempo.L'importante è avere un gameplay profondo e ricco senza che renda il gioco lento e noioso, e in questo il gioco fa centro. Un po' discutibile l'AI dei nemici che, soprattutto se sono umani, è piuttosto semplice e facilmente aggirabile (oltre che battibile). Inoltre sono rivedibili alcune fasi stealth, in quanto alcune aree piuttosto illuminate sono considerate al buio e i nemici non ti vedono anche se sei a pochi metri da loro. STORIA:Si riesce a godere appieno dell'opera solo se si sono giocati pure i precedenti due capitoli, ma anche da sola riesce ad emozionare. Una trama semplice ma intensa, forse un filo prevedibile ma che trasmette emozioni e permette di empatizzare coi personaggi, oltre al fatto che le nostre azioni hanno delle conseguenze anche ai fini della trama. In conclusione, so che è una recensione un po' caotica (cercherò di metterla in ordine) ma descrivere un gioco così ricco di dettagli interessanti è veramente difficile.In ogni caso è nettamente più lungo dei precedenti capitoli, dura quanto gli altri due messi insieme se non di più (ma dipende anche da come si gioca), ma lo consiglio a chiunque. VOTO: 9.5/10 (per colpa dell'AI e dei volti) EDIT 1: Ho giocato il DLC ""The Two Colonels"" e l'ho trovato molto interessante, nonostante sia piuttosto breve e poco di azione. La cosa che più mi ha fatto piacere è che serve a spiegare una cosa, il cui esito è già chiaro durante il gioco, ma che avrebbe potuto rimanere inspiegato.Se la storia quindi è interessante, bisogna far notare però come tutto il resto sia praticamente invariato, se non per l'aggiunta della voce del protagonista (che non sarà Artyom) e per l'aggiunta del lanciafiamme. EDIT 2: Ho completato anche il secondo DLC, ""Sam's Story"" e l'ho trovato nettamente superiore al primo, al pari del gioco base. La durata è piuttosto buona, sulle 6/7 ore, e l'ambientazione è ampia e varia, con libertà di movimento ma anche zone chiuse e claustrofobiche.Ho notato una maggior presenza del lato survival rispetto al gioco base, con meno filtri, risorse e munizioni, e anche qualche novità. Tra queste spiccano due armi nuove (mitra e pistola) e un radar per individuare trappole e risorse.Sono presenti anche alcuni boss, non particolarmente originali ma resi abbastanza difficili dalla costante presenza di pipistrelli che attaccano il giocatore durante la battaglia."

1077,rugal1998,"Jun 22, 2020",8,"Um dos melhores videogames que eu já joguei. Eu jogo por muito tempo agora e completei quase 700 jogos, incluindo vários títulos FPS e é definitivamente um dos melhores (com os títulos anteriores do Metro, jogos Bioshock, etc.). O arco da história é satisfatório e emocionalmente impactante, os personagens são adoráveis ​​e você realmente se importa com eles, enquanto os trechos de histórias que você pode encontrar no mundo são interessantes - embora muitas vezes tristes. Mas na história principal, sempre há esperança, mesmo nos momentos mais sombrios. O jogo é extremamente envolvente, graças a muitos aspectos diferentes. Assim como The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, este jogo não segura sua mão e respeita sua inteligência, e há um nível estelar e design de jogabilidade para apoiá-la. Os principais pilares - combate, exploração e sobrevivência - que são parte integrante da experiência, funcionam perfeitamente juntos, cada um deles se sente gratificante e satisfatório, enquanto a narrativa forte ajuda a unir essas coisas ainda mais próximas e elevá-las ao próximo nível. Não há buscas inúteis e sem sentido, todos os lugares do mundo têm sua própria história e há uma forte razão para você ir a lugares diferentes. Além disso, é possivelmente o jogo mais bonito que eu já joguei (joguei nas configurações mais altas do PC, que são: Extreme Settings, Tesselation, Advanced PhysX on, HairWorks on 3440x1440p). Não apenas pelos gráficos, mas também pelo design artístico. Se este jogo tivesse sido lançado no Steam e não houvesse a controvérsia da Epic Store, ele teria pontuações de 7/10 e 8/10. É uma obra-prima com pequeno revés."

1079,AlexSmekhov,"Jun 20, 2020",5,"Да это украинская игра, но про Московское метро, и у меня бы не было особых претензий к озвучке и к очередным аляповатым, торчащих из каждого угла —  «мля, пацаны, я маслину словил», если бы игру делали про киевское метро, но разработчики эксплуатируют «русский мир», и озвучку могли завезти соответствующую, при этом это не так сложно и дорого.Самые два сильно бросающихся недостатка игры, как по мне - это действительно слабый сюжет и постоянная неуместная «советизация» окружения. И если по книге, было четко понятна мотивация Артема и его желание исхода, после очередных выходов на поверхность для улавливания сигнала с других городов, который был совершен только им одним! с Анной и на тойоте. (всех других «коллективное метро» соблазнило, либо убило. и мельник был нейтрал ивил) то в игре этот выход притянут за уши, и прямо ощущается как сценарий этой игры пришит белыми нитками - искусственно подмененный наивный идиот мельник, бравая команда однокашников дурачков с очевидно тупой мимикой и анимацией на пафосно вычурном пердимонокле - паровом поезде с уже отчеканенными подстаканниками. игру явно хотели продать американцам и другим западным игрокам, которые не смогут отличить украинца от русского или белоруса ни разу не были в России. И которым очень зайдет эта условная водка, балалайка и медведь. все эти Арээтььоом, огурцы в банке, ковры на стенах, старые модели поездов и турникетов, которых давным давно в московском метро уже не было к 2013 году (время начала катастрофы по хронологии вселенной) и которым явно не место в постапокалиптичной России 2035 года. Пузатые мониторы допотопных комплюктеров, ржавые корпуса москвичей 2138, советские плакаты 86-89, цой на кассетных пленках, шапки-ушанки, одни и те же модели старых ящиков и настольных ламп перекочевавших из прошлых частей с минимальными изменениями - все это выдает дизайнерские ошибки и лень. и может быть это было уместно в первой игре по метро на участках красной линии и очень редких занырах на поверхность радиоактивной Москвы 2033 года на 2-3 минуты пока хватало фильтра, но не в игре 2019. Была возможность сделать реальный добротный Российский постапокалипсис, а получились хрущобы и НИИХУиЯ (научно исследовательский институт химических удобрений и ядов) максимум тянет на аддон к ласт лайту. они даже звук метательного ножа не поменяли с прошлой игры. Все эти здания 70х годов постройки. я что гуляю по воспоминаниям и впечатлениям господина Прохорова от поездки по Москве 91 года?! нет, спасибо не надо, я лучше на pastvu зайду, или почитаю соответствующий пост Варламова про прогулку по Москве 93 года.что они вообще 5 лет делали?! скучный финал, море багов, скандал с эпик и стим стором. игра ощущается как отрезанный ломоть. фейл 2019 года для меня.5 из 10.

1089,rysel_,"Oct 22, 2020",9,"This was one of the most intense games I ever played. It is so dense of details and interaction that the immersion is purely insane. The choice of making multiple small open world maps is brilliant and gives enough freedom without losing the narrative pace.I don't give 10/10 just because of the bugs, come on this could have been a true masterpiece but those little bugs really break the immersion.Anyways I clapped at the end, and I rarely do it. Well done!"
1090,dziobsson,"Jul 15, 2020",8,"Nicely written scenario, but the main story plot could be more complex (some minor details are illogical). The moral points system has been changed in this part and this is a good decision. However, it still forces u to choose one and only - correct way of dealing with the game. Open world is not so ""opened"" as it was advertised, but the astonishing visual side of this product lets u forget about those limitations. Unfortunately, the optimization of this game on a PC barely exists...."

1099,Cynical_Aspie,"Aug 13, 2020",8,"This review goes in-depth about both the virtues and gripes I have on this game. I'll state immediately that I never got this on Epic Store and waited for Steam release. People who did their research would know that much of the 4A staff that worked on this also worked on the semi-open world that defined the STALKER series of the 00s. The addition of three open world maps, on paper, seem to be a valiant attempt to recapture that feel; but with a minimum of NPC encounters (though mutants aplenty), the open world can seem empty, not helped by the occasional invisible barrier on what you can climb on (the old STALKER series at least had an in-game justification for why you couldn't venture in certain map areas -- Exodus doesn't seem to have this excuse). The maps themselves, however, are intricately and beautifully made, enough to forgive the negligible update in graphics. Whether they lived up to the STALKER games is purely based on opinion. Gameplay is much what you'd expect from Last Light and Redux, but with the addition of a crafting system that occasionally gets finicky and feels tacked on at times. Weapon condition is also a thing, but can only be cleaned at workbenches (a questionable game element, imo). Stealth, while not broken completely, is tough with the simplified visibility indicator, but the enemies, while improved in AI from 2033 and Last Light, is just dumb enough that you can get out of a tight spot on Normal difficulty. Despite the moniker, Exodus doesn't take place in a whole lot of metro systems; there's just the first chapter and the final set of chapters when you need to retrieve medical supplies for an ailing character. Both are very linear; the story itself is very linear, but each open map can result in one of the crew killed off, injured, or otherwise written out of the story depending on your actions in said map. Moral points are back, but unlike the previous two games, are generally far more intuitive to find, most of which are based on stealth an area, a few fetch quests, and sparing either misguided enemies or noncombatants. And, just like Last Light, they directly influence your ending. And speaking of story, I would say this is one of the weaker aspects of the game: it effectively begins as a more optimistic take on the end of the Metro 2035 novel. And like that, the Dark One have minimal (if any) involvement. This removes a good chunk of the series conflict, though it's not gone entirely. The short is that the Rangers jack a train from Hansa, reveal some conspiracy that kept the people of Moscow from knowing there were other survivors on the surface, try to contact what's left of the Russian government, and look for a clean place to settle. It's not original, but is pulled off with enough charm and competence to be forgiven for being this derivative. And before some rants about this game being political, Metro has been political since the original book, which picked apart the internal workings of Russia's government. Not surprising, considering Glukovsky's work as a journalist. All three of the games have Aesops, almost akin to the ""War is Hell"" theme of the Gundam series. Any complaints about political themes should have been directed at the first game. Insofar as bugs, I only encountered a single one that was easily remedied by going to a previous save: namely somehow getting stuck holding the Universal Charger (yes, it's still a thing) and not being able to switch to another item. Apart from that, I hardly even encountered graphical glitches, let alone something game-breaking. If I were to assign a number score, I'd rate this higher than most other games from the 2010s, but...still not equal to the magic of the previous two games or even their spiritual predecessors (the STALKER games). But frankly, once I knew that it was departing from the Metro theme, I asked myself two things: does it work, and is it fun? On those questions, I felt they were solid ""yes"". So I can't recommend a better game for the release year it was in. Cynic, out."

Bir kaç ana ve yan görevden sonra hikayenin ilerliyormuş hissi vermesi ve yepyeni bir mekana geçmemiz çok akıllıcaydı. Hikayesi de çok iyi. Metro hissi pek kalmamış ama ben aramadım açıkçası.
1104,Kochet,"Oct  3, 2020",10,"Игра просто замечательная! С небольшим бюджетом сделать такой шедевр! Конечно, есть минусы. Это анимация лица и персонажа в целом. Пустой открытый мир. Но все это можно простить. Это вам не EA или UBISOFT. Это наша родная игра для нашего народа с небольшим бюджетом. Плюсы игры: атмосфера, сюжет, стрельба, погружение и много чего еще. На концовке чуть вообще не заплакал. Короче 4A games и Дима Глуховский просто лучшие."
1105,ADEGaming,"Oct  1, 2020",10,"One of the best looking games so far. But, it is the graphics that carry this game?Metro series is very close to my heart since it surrounds about hardships, trust, and family. The story of the protagonist to aim for a better life for him and his people and save those who need help along the way was well executed.Artyom may be a hero, but commander Miller is a legend!Con: constant stuttering, maybe due to bad port. But I got used to it."

1107,super_absorber,"Jun 12, 2021",6,"2021 Enhanced Edition. To me, gaming experience is the most important. The game experience director should be fired, there were countless frustrating and time wasting moments for me, like, seriously frustrating, which could be avoided if they spend a little thought to think about the player's perspective. Other than that, the story is mediocre, the AI characters are robotic as hell, the gun action is OK. There are many bugs in the game, but they are tolerable. What's good about this game? The environment. So gorgeous with RTX on. That's it. Should you spend your money and ~15 hours to play this game? Definitely not. Stay away."

1109,PredatorNGMC,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Начнём с минусов:1. Анимация. Выглядят они ужасно, прям видно промежуток между концом и началом проигрывания анимации. Это я ещё не говорю про то, что автомат может в воздухе зависнуть рядом с рукой держащего его персонажа.2. Мало оружия. Убрали винторез, огнемёт(тот который можно получить с секретом не наносит урона), калаш 2012, абзац, хлопушку, подонок, велопал, превед, дуплет, медвед, сайгу, гранаты липучки, гранаты с горящей смесью, клеймор а добавили бульдог, молотов(заменяющий воспламеняющиеся гранаты), и все.Это были все минусы которые я смог выделить, теперь перейдем к плюсам:1. Персонажи. Таких живых персонажей я встречал наверное только в других играх серии, они постоянно о чем то говорят, противники могут говорить о ваших действиях, друзьям всегда есть что сказать.2. Кастомизация и крафт. О крафте особо ничего сказать за исключением того, что он очень простой и очень удобный, а вот кастомизация это тот самый пункт который перекрывает минус малого количества оружия. Как многие из вас помнят, в прошлых частях еще была рельса, рпк и акс-у, которых в этой части как таковых нету. Так вот акс-у теперь появляется почти сразу же, и из него можно сделать обычный калаш, и рпк, а рельса теперь делается из тихаря, так на А-шот можно поставить и 2 ствола, и целых 4 ствола, ну вообщем думаю вы поняли масштабы кастомизации.3. Открытый мир. Это и минус и плюс, для меня и для людей которые не долбятся в глаза, мир получился крайне насыщеным, постоянно где то что то происходит, то гнездо мутантов, то просто они тут место сторожат, то бандиты, то демон, то, если вы вышли ночь, шаровая молния, вообщем мир живет, в той же пустыне дается машина, что скрашивает и ускоряет перемещение по локации.4. Вариативность прохождения. Наследие 1 части не ушло, а эволюционнировало. Уровень можно пройти чуть ли не 4 разными вариантами, и это я говорю про скрытное, ведь можно по старинке взять все штурмом.5. Картинка. Когда ты на поезде видишь ржавчину, это значит, что картинка игры просто наиахуенейшая, тут больше нечего сказать. А дизайн врагов и локаций это нечто, мутанты настолько живо выглядят, что кажется будто можно пожамкать кожу, на этом мертвом упыре.6. Оптимизации. На моем компе предназначеным на минимальные настройки, игра выдаёт 60 фпс, провисая только в момент первых 2 выстрелов, и иногда когда смотрю на огонь, все крайне идеальная, ни одного критического бага, ни одного вылета.7. Звуки и музыка.8. Стрельба. Я боялся, что стрельба будет х...крепким среднячком, но она получилась крепким отличником, каждый выстрел делает отдачу, враги реагируют на попадания более живо, сам звук оружия радует, вообщем с этим аспектом все даже лучше чем в прошлых частях серии, правда небольшие проблемы с хит-боксами."
1110,Gorbunov2004,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"В игре такая же офигенная атмосфера как и в прошлых частях. Сюжет также хорош, в игре появилась система крафта патронов, снаряжения. Появился транспорт это Буханка и лодка. Мутантов очень сильно переработали они сами на себя не похожи и это классно. Есть новые мутанты это зверолюди, огромный сом и черви. Оружия стало меньше. Персонажей почти всех раскрывает хорошо. Но иногда погружение в эту чудесную игру портят баги и висящие обьекты."

A huge number of bugs, and in the mission of Kazakhstan? Beating most of the cards on one of the missions the game just broke down, I nedaval to continue the game, I was in a rut, turning the entire Internet was a problem not only for me, I've tried a bunch spasibo, but all was to no purpose, then had to pump cheat trainer to teleport to the next lucaciu, the only way I was able to pass after this prezydenta appears in the head question is it worth it to buy the game for the money, if the middle passage could throw it in pomojku because of the obstruction! p.s. in the pirated version I have not met a single bug"

They are all amazing games and I am so glad I have picked them up to play. I can confirm that I haven't played an FPS in years, let alone, with survival and horror elements. The story is amazingly tailored, but there's one thing that can turn you off unless you decide to do what I did and play the game from the first Metro 2033 to Metro Exodus. The voice actors, at least the English speakers and overall voices don't really fit in the game, and maybe because the game was supposed to be played in Russian, but I like to be able to listen than to read the story. The game has an amazing story and if you ignore the poor voice-overs and acting sometimes of the characters and just play the game, you'd be surprised about the depth and interesting story this game has. I highly recommend it and I would have not thought I would enjoy it so much, one of the best games I've played in years. Hands down!"

1125,awagam34,"Jun 23, 2021",8,"PÓŁ OTWARTY ŚWIATNajwiększym kamieniem milowym w serii Metro jest przeniesienie miejsca akcji z klaustrofobicznych podziemi, na powierzchnię. Klasycznego czołgania się po wąskich korytarzach czy to metra, czy też innych podobnych podziemnych lokacji jest tutajdalej dość dużo. Większość czasu spędzamy jednak w pół otwartym świecie. Właśnie, jak działa ten ""pół otwarty świat""? Jako gracze trafiamy do dużych lokacji, które możemy zwiedzać jak nam się podoba. Lokacje te pełne są misji pobocznych, ciekawych miejsc i obozowisk bandytów. Całość dopełnia cykl dobowy, który ma wpływ na świat. W nocy wszędzie jest więcej mutantów, natomiast skradanie się jest znacznie ułatwione.ROSYJSKOŚĆMiejsce akcji to postapokaliptyczna Rosja i nie ma co do tego najmniejszych wątpliwości. Postacie mówia po angielsku, ale z wyraźnym rosyjskim akcentem, co daje zaskakująco dobry efekt.  Jednak nie tylko to jak sie zachowuja, ale też to co robią bohaterowie pogłebia wrażenie przebywania wśród rosyjskich żołnierzy. Dużo picia alkoholu, przyśpiewki, rosyjskie tradycje. Wszystko to dopełnia klimat nowego Metra.MODYFIKACJE BRONIJest to elemnt który został świetnie przemysłany i zaimplementowany. Do dyspozycji mamy kilka rodzajów broni, natomiast poprzez kostumizacje  możemy zmieniać ich działanie i przeznacznie. Zrobienie snajperki z pistoletu to nic zaskakującego. Całość dopełnia bardzo prosty, ale świetnie pasujący do tej gry system craftingu. Możemy między innymi tworzyć amunicje do śrutownicy, co troche ułatwia zarządzanie amunicja, które było tak ważne w poprzenich odsłonach.GRAFIKAJak na dość małe studio udało się naprawdę dopieścić grafikę. Modele broni, postacie czy pokryte śniegiem brudne posapokaliptyczne okolice Moskwy. To wszystko robi świetne wrażenie. Niestety animacje są sporym mankamentem. Jest ich dość mało, więc przy walce z większa ilością przeciwników rzuca się to mocno w oczy. Dodatkowo same mutanty nie są wystarczająco zróżnicowane co tylko potęguje ten efekt."
1126,AnDuD,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"Прекрасное завершение истории Артема. Если честно, то после концовки у меня нет слов. Не понимаю тех, кто ругает добавление полу-открытого мира. По мне так, он только добавляет атмосферу и показывает, что же творится в других местах. Слишком пусто? В игре пост-апокалипсис, что вы хотите?! Сам сюжет прекрасен.

Начало игры немного отталкивет свои измененным сеттингом, теперь ведь мы не просто ходим по коридорным тунелях метро или минимально свободным путям поверхности, но имеем условный свободный мир, которым является очень большая локация миссии. Заполненость и интересность локация не даст вам заскучать исследуя мир и историю игры. Всегда интересно изучать персонажей, так как в зависимости от местности и условий они все другие, кто-то принял цивилизацию и прогресс как причину конца света и объявил войну этим вещам, назвал их грехом. Другие же, начали строить империю, которая в основу ставит рабский труд и веру в ""святое пламя"". История интереснее другой. Но особенно ценно видеть изменения ключевых героев и их характеров на протяжении всей игры, от жёсткого и практичного полковника, до любящего и жертвенного отца и так далее.Дополнение ""Два полковника"" заставит пролить скупую мужскую слезу любого альфа-самца.В общем (и целом), спасибо разрабам за столь интересную и красивую историю и окончание Метро."

The game has currently auto-saved my progress between an invisible wall and a QTE that refuses to trigger because the NPC required for is stuck on a ledge above and refuses to drop down. The only available option is to restart the chapter (losing hours of progress) but doing so LOSES ALL CHARACTER DIALOGUE. The entire point of the game, THE STORY, becomes DISABLED by backtracking progress. 4A should be ashamed of the state they've left their product in. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."

Hikaye tarafından kitaplarını yalayıp yutmuş birisi olarak kitaptan bazı kesimlerini çıkarmışlar. Açıkçası ilk başta tuhaf geldi kitabı tekrar okuduğumda bu hamle bazı kısımlar için güzel bazı kısımlar için kötü olmuş detaya fazla girmek istemedim. Görüntü açısından abi bu neymiş be yakıyor gerçekten rusya da o havayı hissediyordum. Böyle güzel bir oyunu bize sunun ve yapımında emeği geçen herkese teşekkür ederim.

1146,Emilian17391,"Jul 13, 2021",10,"When Metro: Exodus was announced back in 2017, I was confused. �How can you have a Metro game that isn�t set in �the Metro�, isn�t that their whole thing?� I was afraid that such a departure might harm the series, especially in what looked to be the last installment (if the books are anything to go by). But I believe it was Shakespeare who said �All the world�s a Metro, and all the men and women merely mutants� and I have been pleasantly surprised by Exodus, a game which not only updates many of the previous game�s best features, but that adds a whole new dimension to the series. A Metro for a new generation.Exodus starts off much like the others � you play as the stalwart Artyom, hero of the Metro and former member of the Spartan Order, who now spends his time lugging a radio up to the surface to search for the survivors he believes must still populate the world. Just as in the books, Artyom is a firm believer that the life human beings have in the Metro isn�t worth living, at one point comparing the tunnel dwellers to the mushrooms they grow (a quote I�m very sad was left out). But Artyom continues his investigation and poking his fingers into the wrong pie, is forced to leave Moscow behind, Spartan companions and his wife, Anna in tow."

1148,X1X_ray,"Jul 15, 2021",8,"Metro:Exodus на данный момент лучшая игра в которую я играл. Игра очень проработаная, а от концовки наворачивались слёзы. Больше всего меня впечатлило на сколько детально проработан мир, и какая работа проделана. Но всё же баги присутствуют, это может быть не заметно, но очень портит общую картину игры. А так игра превосходна!"
1149,Metacritic376,"Jul 21, 2021",5,"A test of patience It pains me to say this as a long-time Metro fan. However, Exodus is not a good Metro game. As a game, it is a mediocre game. But as a Metro game, it fails to deliver. Here are the quick run-down of the good and the bad compared to its predecessors: The Good- Faithful art, sound and theme to the original games- Improved art overall- Smart enemy AI The Bad- Bugs, graphical inconsistencies, and crashes- The sandbox world is unintuitive and destroys what defined the franchise; a good, story driven, well-thought-out levels- The game is unnecessarily prolonged by the need to constantly travel between objectives- Weak storyline- No true isolation and horror theme- Weak level design- Bad pacing"
1150,Chef_Atico,"Aug  7, 2021",9,"Метро Исход, пожалуй, одна из моих любимых игр.Сюжет, не удивительно что многим иностранцам он не понравился или не был ими понят. Помимо основных действий, игра хорошо показывает Российскую действительность.Также воюем с кем-то уже 20 лет, также нашу страну не могут поднять уже 20 лет, также нас пугают ""врагами"" уже 20 лет...Сюжет, абстрагированно от выше сказанного, хороший. Особенно концовка, она вызвала у меня сильные эмоции.Я считаю что вывести метро из метро было хорошей идеей. Мы уже видели метро, а что там на верху? Задавал я себе этот вопрос и через несколько лет, на мой глухой вопрос наконец-то был получен ответ. Все что происходит на локациях вполне могло произойти и в реальности. Волга - люди поклоняются Царь-рыбе и отрекаются от электричества. В реальном мире некоторые 5G считают опасностью и помимо этого охотно слушая ВЕСЬ бред что им говорят. Я считаю происходящее на локации оправданным.Ямантау - болезнь куру. Правда единственным минусом является то, что зараженные этой болезнью не живут больше 9 месяцев, а в игре они жили больше 20 лет!Каспий -  Нефтяники рабовладельцы... Да, это может быть. Я уверен, культ нефти появился бы.Тайга - пожалуй я не буду говорить про пионеров. На это отвечает сама игра.Новосибирск - тут некого разбирать. Вы можете сказать про ДЛС, но я в не играл в него. Скрытая мораль - ""Каждый пожинает то, что посеял, Артем. Насилие порождает насилие, и за смерть платят смертью. Те, кто не испытывает сомнений и не знает раскаяния, никогда не вырвутся из этого круга."" Цитата Хана из метро 2033. Техническая составляющая не плохая и не хорошая.Графика. видно что у ребят(студии) нет большого бюджета, но она не плохая, она приятная и все. Вы сейчас удивитесь, но моя разогнанная GTX 750 ti на средних настройках выдаёт 40-60 кадров.  Хотя в более сложных играх она уже теряет потенциал. Потенциал у этой карты в 2021, смешно звучит.Геймплей. ИИ средние. Стелс скудный. Поведение оружие хорошее. Крафт не напрягает, этим он и уникален.И пожалуй на этом я и закончу, я рассказал все что хотел."

1152,Woolee,"Sep 29, 2021",8,"People, are you nuts? You give this game 0 and 1 just because of Epic Store? Without considering the game itself? This not developers blame! And not the game's blame for sure. The game itself is amazing! Perfect atmosphere, good story, interesting gameplay, wonderful world (and it is NOT"
