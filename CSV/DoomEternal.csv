0,Littlebenny44,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter."
1,Duc012,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"Simply the best FPS ever made. I literally have nothing to add. Music's amazing too, of course."
2,WildBunch90,"Feb  7, 2021",10,Great game demons shoot at you. You shoot them back with pew pew and rip the guts.
3,Garliceater8932,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"They are rage, brutal, without mercy. But you. You will be worse. Rip and tear, until it is done."
4,Helloborther25,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"Doom as usual getting better every year. What it was good now with Eternal is even better, extremely violent, basically all the demons from Hell trying to kill you no matter what all sorts of demons."
5,Slipinjimmy907,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"The game is beautiful bloody, gore, the main gameplay is long and wonderful!It has 1 DLC The Ancient Gods which is separated in 2 parts, Part 1 you'll play this year and the second half you'll get it in 2021."
6,REAPER007,"Feb 16, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is the BEST thing that happened with industry and anyone who says different is just a low skill ""Call of Duty"" boy with arms growing out of the 5-th spot. Its really funny to read some reviews on Steam cause all I see is: ""colourfull LGBT interface"" and ""too hard to play on the hardest difficulty"", which again convinces me that people like sh*t and would rather prefer a piece of untested, unotimized and glitchy code (like ""Cyberpuke 2077"").Devs did best imrovements that one could imagine. Eternal is superfast - dash is probably the most incredible thing that a shooter of this lvl actually needed (also monkeybars and trampolines). Add to this an awesome shooting strategy (chainsaw for ammo, glorykill - health, flamebelch - armor) and freaking SICK sound by Mick Gordon - Eternal has EVERYTHING a true fan of shooters need.Best shooter of all time, to my modest opinion."
7,Hoodpants43,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"If ""Smooth as butter"" were made into a game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy what they pulled off here."
8,Werewolf27,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"Про новый DOOM хочется писать исключительно КАПСОМ. В нём хоть и чувствуется преемственность по отношению к игре 2016 года, но это совершенно другая игра. ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО НОВАЯ. Да, она развивает многие идеи прошлой части, но идеи эти зашли так далеко, словно геймплей прибыл с другой планеты — скажем, с Марса."
9,Biggame3,"Feb  7, 2021",10,Doom Guy looks like he has a helping serving of beans daily and kill poopy demons.
10,Zoicher_x3,"Feb 16, 2021",10,"Когда в 2016 году вышел старый дум, я был шокирован тем, насколько он хорош. Эта новая гибель даже лучше."
11,Nosauce77,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is a bestseller, I think the game needs no introduction.Everything is at the highest level here: the gameplay, optimization, graphics is quite good, but probably could be better."
12,Hadaltom_2543,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Worth completing. If the blood, guts, bangin' soundtrack, evil atmosphere, and general badassness that gets your testies all amped with testosterone induced euphoria"
13,KellioxLoden875,"Feb 17, 2021",10,"There is really no need for introduction here - Doom is THE shooter that aims to keep you on your toes from start to finish. Filled with beautifully crafted level designs, incredibly detailed enemies and astonishing soundtrack, I think every fan of the FPS genre should play this game, or at least this franchise."
14,DavidMusk101,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal es el mejor juego de disparos en primera persona que he jugado desde el F.E.A.R original, de hecho, puede que me guste aún más debido al valor de repetición que siento que obtendré de este juego."
15,Bigguygaming88,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Fantastic sequel that builds upon the last one and makes it twice as good. Brutal, challenging, rewarding and satisfying."
16,Acidoic,"Feb 16, 2021",9,"Insane, just play the gamehard difficulty to increase your sanity and reach new highs."
17,Phengophobia0,"Feb 16, 2021",10,This game is amazing even though I suck at it. Remember to dodge **** chainsaw fodder enemies and git gud.
18,Ibidemskydr5423,"Feb 16, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is the best ""Gameplay"" game. It knows its story is dumb but its fun and the fact that a guy literally too angry to die is Bhopping around killing demons is is top tier."
19,CoefSurrey773,"Feb 16, 2021",10,The gameplay is next level and its definitely one of my favourite games of all time. Also the dlc is amazing and well worth the price and the optimization is really good.
20,Rimplebeep16,"Feb 16, 2021",10,Nice step up from Doom 2016 in terms of gameplay. It takes a while to get used to the new mechanics of dashing around and being very mobile but once you do it's about the most fun you can have in a singleplayer FPS. Many QoL improvements to help you find all the secrets. One of the few FPS games I fully enjoyed.
21,Hbombzilophism5,"Feb 17, 2021",10,Very smooth gameplay mechanics and good performance optimization. The Slayer's time is now.. Rip and tear until it's done.
22,Cacogeese,"Jan 21, 2021",10,I haven't had this much fun in a single player FPS since playing through the original DOOM and Quake games even with mods.
23,Rangler53890,"Feb  7, 2021",10,The game's main idea appears to be always to keep moving and is an action title that features a crazy amount of weapon and weak points to exploit in your enemies. There is a lot of detail to appreciate in its gameplay and is one of the best first-person shooters.
24,QueenJames6,"Feb  8, 2021",10,Just came back after last May when they did the stupid Denuvo Anti-cheat update. This is a good game and I recommend you play it.
25,Churdly892,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"The game openly plays better than DOOM 2016 in every way. The game's feel gains some and loses some over Doom 2016, but from a purely gameplay perspective its just incredible. If you love shooters, you love this. Nuf said."
26,Smeltdeltit007,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"the series went from:1 & 2 Dooms - simple atmosphere and shooting in 3D environment, where it was revolutionary at that time.Doom 3 - corridor horror jumpy kinda game.Doom 4 (2016) - rebooting and implementing new techs, but with flaws, many directions and short.Doom 5 (Eternal) - figured out its own direction and went full on with it, which why it's going to take some time to get used to the new system."
27,Bobberman322,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"Если вы фанат DOOM, ПОКУПАЙТЕ ЭТО !. Если вы не фанат DOOM, вы обязательно в нее сыграете;) поэтому ПОКУПАЙТЕ ЭТО!"
28,Romanlarper4,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"В DOOM Eternal есть не только потрясающая боевая система и искусственный интеллект, но и определенные элементы решения головоломок, а также мучительные, подпитываемые адреналином бои, которые, несомненно, избавят вас от любого стресса и заставят вас жаждать большего количества крови и смелости."
29,Beergut40,"Feb  9, 2021",10,Sick game whole hell. Combat is insanely fun and fast. Like Quake and Unreal tournament. Rate 10/10.
30,Lapina356,"Feb  9, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal, наверное, один из самых интересных шутеров от первого лица, в которые я играл за долгое время. В этой игре так много всего, что действительно сработало для меня, с секретами, оружием и тем, как весело исследовать области. В эту игру приятно играть от начала до конца, и я просто хотел большего. На мой взгляд, Doom Eternal намного лучше Doom 2016, потому что здесь все намного лучше."
31,Mrkrabs9263,"Feb  9, 2021",10,"it's DOOM, if you are into action packed fps games this is definitely a game to get."
32,Themoistone9,"Feb  9, 2021",10,Badass game with kickass soundtrack. The game grabs you by the nutsack and never lets go.
33,Mosx100,"Feb 10, 2021",10,Lots of action and demon killing.Few crashes and enemy bugs.Where's the horde mode?
34,Roxsand9,"Feb 10, 2021",10,The game basically makes you feel like an ABSOLUTE BEAST ripping and tearing every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing.
35,Forhead493,"Feb 10, 2021",10,"The satisfaction you get from the kills is immeasurable.And the cutscenes,oh man don't even get me started.You should see when normies encounter The Doomslayer.I play DOOM before workouts for Adrenaline boost,and listen to its Soundtrack during the workout."
36,Fartsniffer9341,"Feb 10, 2021",10,Good Level DesignDecent StorylineReally Good Voice ActingHigh ReplayabilitySatisfactory GameplayBADASS Soundtrack(Thanks to Mick Gordon)
37,Thegoat666,"Feb 10, 2021",10,"Kickass game. Each special demon has a certain weakness, You gather different BADASS weapons as you move on with the missions. You can pick different runes/skills according to your playstyle which is just great."
38,DeadTake26,"Feb 13, 2021",10,At this point if you don't like this game you are just objectively wrong and should go and play Fortnite or some other game meant for three year old's
39,Grugbrain7,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"It is polished, fresh and fun. The game play is the best I've seen in the genre."
40,Joelswole55,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"The game's mechanics are fascinating and put your reasoning and exploration skills to the test. The graphics are top notch and it's really well made though I did have two CTDs. Other than that, I didn't have any other technical issues of any importance. It was entertaining, fun to play and the story was good enough that it held my interest to the end. If you're a fan of the genre, you should enjoy Doom Eternal. 10/10."
41,Doomergloomer8,"Feb 15, 2021",10,Graphics are absolutely stunning along with the layout of the levels. Game is very very fun.
42,Bitcoinshill90,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Badass game. The amount of gore in this game is also quite amazing, as glory kills are very grotesque in the best way possible. You can easily see which demons you have attacked beforehand, as GIB mechanics make it possible to see the chunks of demon you have blown to bits."
43,Desperadoguy6,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Should've gotten game of the year 2020. Amazing, powerful, great soundtrack, and the gameplay is phenomenal"
44,Kurgande206,"Feb 15, 2021",10,Things I never thought I'd say about Doom: I did a ton of reading and enjoyed every bit of it. This game is awesome.
45,Dittovile86,"Feb 16, 2021",10,Best singleplayer first fps and best game music! Rip and tear until it is done!
46,Pavidpay2000,"Feb 17, 2021",10,"The game is pretty much the complete package for me, minor criticizes here and there, but overall I think it's a 10/10. Maybe the best in the series."
47,Dragoman18,"Feb 17, 2021",10,This game did it man. The beginning is a bit rough but once you get past that bit it's so enjoyable beginning to the end. I love this game so much and I can't recommend not enough to anybody who loves these high adrenaline games. 10/10
48,Anthropoglot648,"Feb 17, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal has became my favorite shooter of all time. For a game I expected to suck it completely surprised me at how true it was to the original with a mix of quake and painkiller. It was fast paced, intense, had great enemy and weapons variety and a kick-ass soundtrack."
49,Bangsi,"Feb 18, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is an amazing game that takes everything from DOOM 2016 and improves it, even adding new features that only approve the experience. Let's start off by saying I loved DOOM 2016, It was very fast paced, had amazing gunplay and the glory kills were so awesome. Now for me DOOM Eternal is just like DOOM 2016 but everything has been improved. The graphics have of course been improved, but the visuals have also drastically changed. The background of each level is so unique and cool, for example in the first level with that huge monster in the background, every level has a unique feel to it. The demon models have also been improved and the glory kills are as cool as ever, and super graphic and I love that! Also that soundtrack, my god that soundtrack is SO GOOD!! One of the best soundtracks ever made for a video game for sure, that really compliments the gameplay well, it really makes you feel so badass and when that heavy metal drops you feel invincible. The gameplay is what makes or breaks a DOOM game, and DOOM 2016 really nailed the gunplay and then DOOM Eternal walks in and of course improves upon it. The guns are so fun to use and they all have a purpose. I always felt that the pistol from DOOM 2016 was so useless but I can't think of a single weapon in DOOM Eternal that was useless or bad. The game also runs so smoothly, it's amazing with how fast paced the game is it still ran so smoothly, I don't think I experienced one major frame drop. That's also one thing to keep in mind, this game is very and I mean very fast paced, you need to be on your toes for pretty much the entire game if you're playing on higher difficulties. This is not a normal FPS where you camp somewhere and try to get headshots. In DOOM you face your enemy head on, get right in their face, because that's how you stay alive, health drops from enemies. Even the platforming which was my least favorite part of DOOM 2016 has been improved and is actually fun. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic and I never felt bored once, which is an amazing achievement because even some of my favorite games can have boring moments. The story of DOOM games has never been the focal point, however I'm happy to report that despite this, DOOM Eternal brings a pretty enjoyable story that really commends the chaos of the gameplay. The story is just as crazy as the gameplay at points, which creates very enjoyable moments. There's not more I can say about the story without spoiling it so I'm going to leave it here. Overall, DOOM Eternal is one of my favorite games of 2020 and might actually also be one of my favorite games of all time, and that's not an exaggeration. The graphics, visuals, soundtrack, story and most importantly gameplay with heavy emphasis on the combat are all really great. I honestly don't have anything ""bad"" to say about the game, there might be some grudges but that's not enough to ruin the experience or even altar it. This is what I would call a perfect FPS. I've never been a huge fan of FPS games but DOOM just reinvents the genre. 10/10"
50,Trental1,"Mar  2, 2021",10,"If you like Doom 2016, you will love Doom Eternal. In fact Doom Eternal is a lot better and has more deep gameplay."
51,Sinkyfeet7449,"Mar  2, 2021",10,Game is way harder and faster than 2016 but also much more enjoyable. Gameplay is a lot more complex.
52,Balustrade16,"Mar  2, 2021",10,Mechanics wise this is probably the best FPS ever created. I've played something with this deep combat in long time.
53,Witchdoctor8429,"Mar  2, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is so friggin badass. Definitely one of my all time favourites.
54,Banjolin66,"Mar  2, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is, essentially, the childhood fantasy of Doom 2 that I conjured up in my head when I stared at the cover art."
55,Caecity48,"Mar  2, 2021",10,This is the best single player FPS ever made. This is the best single player FPS ever made.
56,Welkgbang979,"Mar  2, 2021",10,Best FPS - Action Game Arcade I have seen! Recommended. Doom 2016 is crap compared to this.
57,Dongle29,"Mar  3, 2021",10,Just amazing. Doom Eternal is an improvement over Doom2016 in every single way.
58,Unipara95,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"I've played Doom 2016 and now going into Doom Eternal I was excited and knew I was going to experience a masterpiece but wow this game is poetry. The ambience, the music of this game, the way the map is designed, the flow of combat, everything is just pure bliss to experience."
59,Kirtlehorky687,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"I played and loved Doom 2016, and Eternal really is just 2016 pumped up a notch. Everything you enjoyed from 2016 is here, plus more weapons, more unlockables, longer maps, it's just better. Plus, it's also fine to player Doom 2016 even if you play Eternal first."
60,Xeniumbaw01,"Mar  4, 2021",10,The combat is deeper and faster than Doom 2016. The game's systems have subsystems.
61,Xxxt3ns1on42,"Mar 21, 2021",10,This must be one of the best FPS games I've ever played. It's very easy to get your ass kicked on nightmare difficulty. Maybe I'll finish it on ultra nightmare someday.
62,Semperfiredog10,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"The story is great, the graphics are great, the ambiance is great, the music if OUTSTANDING. This is easily one of the best DOOM games ever made!"
63,Bendover69,"Mar 23, 2021",10,This good stuff. Its top tier combat is pretty much umatched. The levels are great and soundtrack is amazing.
64,humra,"Mar 24, 2021",10,Improvement over the 2016 doom in every way. A must-play for the fans of the franchise.
65,Titaniumvirus4,"Mar 26, 2021",10,I honestly haven't had a more satisfying game as someone with bad ADHD this game deffenatly keeps me on my toes with how hard it is or even can be love it a lot hope more fans get into it.
66,Mcpain826,"Mar 31, 2021",10,This game is way better than 2016. Its improvement over it in every single way.
67,Austr_Alien,"Jan 28, 2021",10,"Incredible game, easy to run, awesome soundtrack and really good story (although it could've been delivered better). Despite what others might say, the Marauder fits well into the game giving you a good  mix-up in terms of gameplay rather than just mindlessly killing demons and the resource management is a great introduction and actually makes you think about what guns you should use and when you should use them."
68,Dipso10,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"Its more Doom, and its good. :)At first i was a bit put of by the more Arcady UI design and the ""combat is a puzzle"" aspect of Eternal, but i gave it another chance and boy, i had no reason to be skeptical. Its a great game and for a lore buff like me its stuffed with world building that you can enjoy in the few calm moments between the insane high speed action."
69,Aemaeth23,"Mar 26, 2021",10,Fly through interesting demon infested locations as the worlds most encumbered trapeze artist. By the end of the game it will look like you're typing an essay if you're playing right.The story is probably the weakest parts for me. The designers give you a lot of breaks in between intense combat but I always found myself wanting more. It was an absolute blast to do the optional challenge encounters and the master levels were probably my favorite single player fps levels ever.
70,Komnpsi33,"Mar 26, 2021",10,A legendary game with the tightest gameplay loop of anything I've every played. The developers have done amazing work and deserve praise for this masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and play it.
71,Afkandy47,"Mar 28, 2021",10,The combat in this game is absolutely fantastic and makes you feel like a bad ass from start to finish. This game also goes into the lore of the doom slayer which is nice to actually have some story along with slaying demons for hours on end.
72,Vitaminus2,"Mar 29, 2021",10,Hard to go back to DOOM 2016 after flipping an arachnotron like a table and stabbing in the eye.
73,Chrome32,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"This game was absolutely amazing, as soon as i started playing i was hooked till the end! I will say i've only done one play through, i'm not the type of person to keep going till i've played on every difficulty and collected all the collectibles. Regardless though, it is fun. Personally, i think i'd wait for a sale if i were you, didn't take me too long to complete, since i grinded it. But definitely recommend getting if on sale."
74,Jeffdadoom9775,"Mar 29, 2021",10,It's a masterpiece. That is all. It's a masterpiece. That is all. It's a masterpiece. That is all.
75,Guerrilla8807,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is my favorite game of all time. I put more hours into it on the Xbox, so my hours on PC do not indicate how much I play accurately. This game gets you into the fun zone so easily and regularly, the developers are super responsive, and the community is amazing. If you want to be apart of a group of people that are very active, nice, and creative, the discord is a place for you."
76,Hatemail9999,"Feb  1, 2021",10,Best decision I've made in 2020 was play this game.The amount of action packed content there is just blows my mind.The music with the fast paced shooting just gives you the most fun ever.I recommend this game for people who like fast-paced and fps games.it is also a very good aim trainer on the nightmare mode.Try buying this game during a sale.
77,Jamaid3,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal has to be one of the most interesting First Person Shooters that I have played in a long time. There is so much about this game that really worked for me, with the secrets, the weapons, and just how fun the areas are to explore. The game is a blast to play from start to finish and I just wanted more of it. In my opinion, Doom Eternal is much better than Doom 2016 because everything here is more enjoyable as an experience."
78,Baycan59,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"This game truly is amazing, most of the negative reviews are from people who don't like this games flow(what i do understand because it is a bit more advanced than in the earlier doom games. this game may be a bit expensive(especially if you want the dlc's with it too) and requires a strong pc. but for the price you pay it is a great game. and this will probably be the peak of what the doom franchise will become. i will never get tired of the feeling of immortality that this game gives you when you begin the get used to the combat, and even though you feel so powerful and immortal the dev's have also made it so the game keeps difficult and asks for your attention. definitely a masterpiece of a game. i hope microsoft will continue to put as much effort in the next doom games as bethesda and id software have put in this one. i definitely recommend trying this game out for yourself."
79,Soupisking94,"Mar 26, 2021",10,I didn't like 2016 thought it was overrated and bland but this is one of the best games i've ever played.
80,Angeldeath100,"Mar 26, 2021",10,Absolutely amazing graphics and gameplay. killer sounds track. I love the weapons in the game.
81,Shelooklegal38,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"Absolutely amazing game, with fun gameplay. As an absolute completionist, at least in DOOM games, I have sinked about 10 hours in one session in, and made it to the ""Super Gore Nest"" 100% completed. I extremely look forward to playing again because theres just so much to find and the shooter aspect of it is absolutely flawless. I'm playing my first playthrough on Ultra-Violence and its really fun. At some sections you get stuck for a couple of minutes but eventually you adapt, learn the enemy positions and overcome the hardest part of any level, and thats the most satisfying part of the game in my eyes. Absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes a satisfying challenge with some exploration mixed in for added spice."
82,Nuclearroach64,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"Easily one of the best shooters in the past year. You go fast and rip ass. Story is there, but the gameplay is more the focus and its very well done. Not to mention that the aesthetic is metal as ♥♥♥♥. Goes without saying that the music is perfect to listen to while you are rip and tearing. DLCs are not the greatest thing out there, but they are good supplemental challenge that involves new enemy types that require more attention than in the base game. I wouldn't buy them separate. All in all, would recommend, Doom is good game."
83,Denta6,"Mar 26, 2021",10,Refines on what DOOM 2016 did without feeling repetitive as the previous game or changing too much and losing what makes DOOM great. Highly optimized and polished game.
84,Ivcan04,"Mar 26, 2021",10,A must play. The atmosphere of the game is incredible. There are some annoying mechanics but still the positives are alot more. I totally recommend it.
85,Skyler40,"Mar 26, 2021",10,Best game ever made. bullet ballet fps perfection. best combo swapping of all time. 100/10 would always recommend to anyone looking for a new hobby
86,Void12,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"You can use your legs for locomotive or horizontal projection purposes, you can also use your basic motor functions to make other lifeforms to have their pain receptors react in a violent way and also make then species stop breathing, 10/10"
87,Tastytoast4010,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"Yes. One of the best shooters of all time. Every level introduces at least two new weapons/abilities and two new enemies to contend with. When I first heard that there were going to be double the amount of enemies I could not fathom how they could have implemented it, but my god have they done a fantastic job. You learn their patterns and the best weapon combos to defeat them.Music is killer thanks to the talented Mick Gordon and heightens the tension during key moments."
88,Friendlychem7,"Mar 30, 2021",10,Best FPS shooter out there. Very little hand holding and harder difficulties are (for the most part) properly balanced. 10/10 would rip and tear again
89,Bruh90,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"This game took everything Doom 2016 had and multiplied it by x10. The Gunplay, The Enemies, Speaking of the enemies, i LOVE the classic look of them. i would've absolutely loved it even more if the original Baron Of Hell Design came back, but the fireborn baron was okay too :)Favorite Demon hands down is the Tyrant. Favorite Gun, is the super shotgun, its very meaty and sleek, and i love the meathook. favorite level probably has to be Final Sin. it feels great to play, and there are absolutely no slowdowns unlike Doom 2016. (ahem, Vega Central Processing) I Recommend it. and remember kids, the Marauder isnt hard."
90,Nuclearboom2077,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is one of those games that bring back the old retro shooter combat but in a newer way. It really is one of the best first person shooters on the market if not the best due to the pacing, the combat, the pickups. and the movement. Doom Eternal's entire focus is on the feel of the combat not the look of the combat, the gun sounds the executions are examples of this.The puzzles do not bother me because they don't last long, and at some point there needs to be a mix up anyway.Doom Eternal is just pure adrenaline fueled, blood soaked carnage that I don't think anyone is going to forget anytime soon."
91,Joesphus31,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"Combat is like a complex dance, there is no other game where the flow of combat feels so satisfying to play. After fighting its fun to explore maps full of secrets hidden throughout!"
92,Briankemp2,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success."

94,LesbianofUs3,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is an outstanding title with one of the best shooting I have experienced in gaming, It is a superb title with almost no flaws and adds diverse layers to an established genre."
95,Broach907,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"In DOOM Eternal enemies have weak points that can be exploited to either make them easier to kill or disable a capacity in them, such as long-range weaponry. The attention to detail here is astounding, as you keep searching for these during combat and start to learn their weaknesses. Targeting a weak point is the difference between killing a demon with few bullets or an entire magazine! It is satisfactory, too, as you get to hear a ""bing"" sound every time you hit a weak point."
96,Thundercock36,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"Don't listen to all the fools complaining about there being no ammo, you have a chainsaw that recharges itself and when used replenishes around half of your ammo. Rip and tear and, most importantly, chainsaw until it's done."
97,Luckystrikes69,"Feb  7, 2021",10,Its Doom 2016 but better. Better movement and more strategy. Enemies also have weakpoints which is cool.
98,Goku35367,"Feb  7, 2021",10,"Compared to the 2016 version, this game is overall better and a worthy successor,"
99,Fletcher23,"Feb  8, 2021",10,"Great game cerebral badass combat and levels.  intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude."
100,Proflaker4,"Feb  8, 2021",10,Gameplay faster and better than Doom 2016. The game's subsystems have subsystems. This is a take or leave depending on taste
101,Watonsoup111,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"Probably one of the best single player, FPS of all times. Only would have been happier if there weren't quite so many maneuverability tests that were Mandatory (for us non-speed runners) throughout the levels."
102,Funkhozer39,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"When DOOM came out in 2016, I was shocked of how good it was. When DOOM Eternal came out in 2020, I was shocked of how better is than DOOM (2016). This should say something."
103,Kermiskey453,"Feb 15, 2021",10,"When you actually finish the game and feeling like a better player afterward will surely make you feel something inside. Accomplishment? maybe. Shame? partly. But mostly just sad that its over. Anyways gotta go melt my face with adrenaline, brain works twice as fast now and real life is way too slow."
104,Augmentl49,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"Visceral, brutal, fast-paced and challenging, Doom Eternal can seem daunting to someone not used to fast-paced first person shooters. But don't let that put you off - the game does a fantastic job of raising your skill ceiling as you progress, and enemies that might seem impossible on your first few attempts become near cannon-fodder as you master their weaknesses and understand the right weapon combos to apply. Doom Eternal is also one of the very few games I have experienced that produces a state of flow - where after a while you find yourself almost not thinking about the game, just reacting on instinct as you mow down enemy after enemy, never once staying still. At a certain point, something ""clicks"" and you become one with the game, and what was previously an endless stream of quick decisions in the heat of combat becomes something akin to a blood-soaked dance. The satisfaction of beating a seemingly impossible arena after several attempts is almost euphoric. Overall, Doom Eternal is one of the best games in recent memory, and the best FPS in its category hands down. A tribute to the original Doom with the addition of second-to-second tactics like never before. Get it, and Git Gud."
105,Nayjay61,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"In an age where every piece of media seems to be cannibalizing my childhood in an attempt to sell my own nostalgia back to me, Doom is a breath of fresh air. I love everything about this game; the pace, the lore, the gore, the mechanical skill, but most importantly, this game is so perfectly designed. It teaches you how to play it, gently pushing you into the fun zone - when you die, it isn't because the game is artificially hard, it's because you made a mistake, and you know exactly what that mistake was. To me, this is a perfect game."
106,High_Hopes_,"Dec 14, 2020",9,Better than 2016 Doom. Story added more depth to it and world felt more immersive than 2016 Doom.
107,Goon17,"Mar 25, 2021",10,Very fast paced first person shooter that gets even faster the more you progress so far I've played 11 hours and I'm having a great time with it I can only hope it gets better from here.
108,Xmadking874,"Mar 26, 2021",10,I haven't had this much fun in a long ass time. Great game to take your mind off college and to just enjoy. I bought it for the singleplayer and it did not disappoint.
109,Granpda1,"Mar 28, 2021",10,Expands on what DOOM 2016 did and did everything that game did... better! I really enjoyed how colorful the game is compared to 2016 and the variety of different environments

116,KetchupStorm,"Apr 13, 2020",9,"I think this game is really, really good. The only issue I have with it is that there gap in difficulty from ultra-violence to nightmare is a bit too steep. On ultra-violence I beat most encounters without dying or in a few tries at best, however on nightmare I die a lot, and it takes me many tries to beat the same encounters i did with relative ease on ultra-violence. Aside from this i have nothing negative to say about the game."
117,INStellar_VIPER,"Apr 14, 2020",9,"Maravilloso, super frenético y adictivo, anima a volver a jugar la campaña y seguir mejorando.

119,DoctorCringe,"Jun  6, 2020",9,"Okay, Denuvo's gone now. This game is safe to download and play. Original review:It is unacceptable to include Anti-Cheat software with Kernel-level access to your operating system in a video game. It's even worse to add it a few months after release without warning. Bethesda should not be able to get away with this. To clarify: Kernel-level access essentially means complete access to your operating system. Anti-cheat software should not need this level of access. Ever. I recommend that you stay far away from this game until Denuvo Anti-Cheat is removed."
120,ZetMoriz_,"May 22, 2020",8,"Новый DOOM вышел довольно отличной игрой. Сейчас я распишу сразу плюсы и минусы. + В игре хорошая музыка ( - есть некоторые моменты где она не подходит к обстановке), -+ графон (в DOOM 2016 была намного реалистичней графон, в 2020 он более мультяшный), + продолжительность,  + хардкор, + разнообразие мобов, - слишком медленное добивание врага, которое замедляет геймплей, а ты хочешь рубить демонов под хорошый музон не останавливаясь (хотя есть перк на ускорение, но это надо аж тратить 1 слот на это), + разнообразие оружия и их модификации, - блевотный интерфейс (хоть его можно и изменить, но он все равно остаеться вырви-глазным). Самый жирный плюс игры - это её оптимизация, за все время игра ни разу не вылетила или как-то либо подлагнула или начала фризить. Насчет сюжета ничего не могу сказать, он хороший и неплохой."
121,Surjashis,"Jun  4, 2020",10,Pure METAL & AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Went CRAZY while playing. This is got to be the game of the year.
122,tbnofficial,"Jun  8, 2020",10,"Most of the negative comments are about the following things:- Bad platforming- Less ammo- Cartoonish graphics- Sh*t storyline- Bad UI and ColorsI guess its time to make things clear! In my opinion the game is absolutely fine in this current state (dlcs in the future, improvements, ect.) The game absolutely don't have cartoon like graphics, not even compared to Doom 16 (which I played, before anybody start talking trash), there are games which have graphics like that, for example the Borderlands franchise. Now if you watch a video and compare the too, there is a massive difference! About the platforming, imagine the game without those jumping puzzles, what would it be like? It would be boring af, just going from fight to fight with no connections.... This game is nowhere near to Mario games, and never gonna be. ""Less ammo Can't use one gun for the whole damn game :c "" - Okay, so imagine they would give more ammo. More ammo to the bfg, the rocket launcher, and every other gun. Lets rocket burst every demon in a fight... a fight wouldn't be challenging. Just use quickswitching and try to use every weapon, OR play on the lowest difficulty where you get more ammo pickups. Last but not least if you think the storyline is not required in a doom game, just stop playing any of them. Playing trough Doom eternal helped me understand the backstory of the slayer.An absolute masterpiece, deserves every spent penny and a game of the year!"
123,Kalili,"Jul 21, 2020",9,"I don't like DOOM 2016, I like this.More challenging, requires more skill, more thought, more accuracy and more movement. It's not like DOOM 2016 where you have almost infinite ammo and you can just jump around with your super shotgun, you actually have to use many different weapons that require different ammo. The parkour stuff is great. it's new, but it's great. Overall a very fun and energetic experience."
124,SirHanrik,"Jun 20, 2020",10,"Fast paced, brutal, unrelenting action. Polished, runs super smooth on pc.ID evolved the DOOM combat formula to a whole new level, forcing you to play smartly and be aware of all that is happening around you.Combined with another banger OST by Mick Gordon, easily GOTY for me so far."

126,cringeybabey,"Aug 22, 2020",9,"A worthy sequel to a brilliant game with amazingly fluid combat and tons of depth of gameplay. The story kind of sucks, and Samuel Hayden's character feels really contrived sometimes. The music is also a step back from the previous game, but just shooting in this game is an absolute blast and feels like near perfection."
127,Jagger510,"Nov 12, 2020",10,"Hardcore part of DOOM comparing to DOOM 2016 (both of them still can make you suffer on 'Nightmare' difficult).Many funny stuff. Interesting story, collectable items and tonnes of new and old monsters."
128,Smile_Bot,"Nov 20, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal is a kinetic first person shooter that shows just how fun a video game can be. A Solid 9/10, and was very close to a 10 for me, but, for all the praise, it has flaws.GameplayThe gameplay is simple, with the Doom Slayer reacting in the way you expect and all times, every mechanic is simple: do this, and get an output. Yet the chaotic fast paced shooting quickly becomes complex and methodical. Every simple idea gets compounded one, after another, after another, each is explained but it takes the entire campaign to truly understand the mechanics that are given to you. The game is brilliantly paced. Abilities you learned at earlier levels you find yourself using more and more with other abilities later in game, finding synergies amongst your equipment. The game gives exponentially more options, making each combat encounter having thousands to millions of ways to approach. Whether going for a weak point on a big enemy, or ridding a entire area of smaller ones, the gameplay keeps the interactions between you and demons interesting with the game giving you so many ways to approach, you truly adapt to the game and learn it through and through.DesignThe Design of the game is made to be fast,. The faster you are the less likely you are you get trapped or hit. This incentivisation of quick reaction gameplay keeps the player on their toes. The genius decision by the Devs to give every enemy you encounter a certain weakness makes switching your arsenal frequent and engaging. The gameplay keeps itself fresh as you constantly have to change your approach from demon to demon. The designs of the different enemies are distinct, and with how fast you move, a glance and you know what is over in that direction. Every enemy is engaging, with all of them having attacks which you can take advantage of, and each one being fun to engage with in combat. (except for one, we will get there)LoreFor having no story, the game has surprising amounts of lore, which can be accessed at any time through the pause menu. The amount of lore you have depends on where you are in the game. I found this system enhanced the experience, and made the game an interesting story experience as well as a gameplay one which doesn’t intrude on repeat play-thrus, which I feel is the perfect balance between the two concepts.Multiplayer: The multiplayer, After the feedback from the first game (Doom (2016)) that the death match mechanics did not match the original game, the developers created one, if not the most creative multiplayer experiences to date. It’s a 1 V 2, with the one being the Doom Slayer himself. The other two being two of the tougher demons, which can spawn underlines, which effectively make an ever adapting assault against the doom slayer in a quick matched arena battle. The multiplayer does have a few glitches to do with the demons being pushed out of the map when spawning, but shortly after they are transported back to their spawn, this can be jarring, but isn't game breaking.FlawsThe game does come with previously mentioned bugs. I ran into a soft lock, as well as some overly hard to get to collectibles, but other then that, the biggest flaw comes in the form of the enemy which stops the game in its tracks every time they appear, causing the player to stand still and simply wait for them to attack, this is The Marauder.Marauder: Unlike all of the other demons, this one can not be killed normally. Whenever it is shot it will resist any damage by pulling up a shield, the marauder can not be faked out or tricked, they will never miss a block. If you get too aggressive and get to close the Marauder attacks instantaneously. If you are too far away they throw projectiles and adds, And the middle ground seems to fluctuate wildly. (which is the only time the Marauder will be able to be hit) The only time you can attack is then the Marauder does their axe attack, which draws the entire game to a halt because it’s random if the marauder is going to. The Marauder is the most annoying part of the game, and is by far the most flawed. (The funny thing is, Marauders are playable in multiplayer, and are fixed. They don’t have shields, and their best defense is movement, meaning you have to predict where they are going to be, which in turn, keeps the Marauder engaging to fight unlike in the actual game.)OverAll I enjoyed my time with  immensely, it’s a strong 9/10 , with the down moments being frustrating, but the highs being so energetic and befitting for one of the best games of the year."

145,TheNoobPolice,"Jun 21, 2020",10,"Once you get into it, it's actually better than the 2016 version overall. The first 90 minutes I was left thinking that'd they'd made a mistake with the ammo attrition, but thankfully it gets a lot better as you more weapons. At first, I thought the platforming is sometimes a bit much, but as you get into it and comfortable, you start to love it. both games had that to some degree. If you don't like first person platforming this is NOT the game for you. Do yourself a favour and turn off the environment screen shake as it's obnoxious when climbing walls. The ammo counts are a bit too low in early game, resulting in too much survival based combat with the chainsaw and glory kills being required mandatory tasks rather than fun things you could do as and when you chose to. I also don't like how you can't now just equip the chainsaw and run around with it. Yes, it didn't really serve any gameplay purpose to do that over this new system, but it still just felt badass. However once you realise the chainsaw auto-regens it makes this a lot more palatable as you don't need to constantly hunt for fuel and you can actually use it far more often m/ The UI is a downgrade though - the lime green / yellow art style doesn't suit the game and looks a bit cheap. The art style for the UI in the first game was so much better, and that can't be overstated. The font choices they have used are really awful. Audio is improved from the first one though, where the sound effects previously weren't always that good and there were some questionable EQ. The music mix is also improved, it's just as epic but a less fatiguing mix. The default mix does put the music way too loud though, but this can be adjusted. The game plays and runs superbly well though and the visuals are amazing - if you liked the first one, then you'll probably like this one, just give yourself an hour to get the first sections out the way as they are not the most inspiring."

156,danpan11,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"Exactly the evolution I expected from developers. Not at all disappointed.I did not play the DOOM 2016 on release date, I actually waited for a very long time, bought in on sale and played on a PS4. I liked the gameplay so much that I basically stopped, turned on my PC and played it there with Steam Family Sharing (my brother is a huge DOOM fan). I must have played that game for at least 40 to 60 hours.DOOM Eternal for me was a must play on release date. I was hyped to see what they can come up on a gameplay perspective to already improve the very addicting cycle of the previous one.GAMEPLAYThis category was heavily improved. The demons are separated in the codex into sections, you have the common demons that are basically cannon fodder, you use them to get either health from Glory Kills or Ammo with the Chainsaw.YOU NEED THE CHAINSAW. Ammo is no joke, you are constantly using your entire arsenal, and with the need to replenish ammo in the middle of a fight.You have more equipment, a Frost Grenade, a Frag Grenade and a Flamethrower all mounted up on your shoulder in a Predator-like add on to the suit.Heavy Demons now have weak points, that require precision in the middle of a crowded fight. For example, the Mancubus has two flamethrowers you need to snipe out in order to reduce his threat. So, you can remove each weapon and then focus on other demons, or maybe just focus on him entirely, is your choice.You have a Meat Hook with the Super Shotgun, you can DASH, Double jump, Vault on yellow pipes. The amount of mid air options they added is actually very good. You are a lot more mobile this time around.If you sum up all of these improvements, not only the game feels different than the 2016 one, but is improved in every way, the weak points require you to think in the middle of a fight how to cripple a heavy demon and then get back on the move, and when you move, the levels are designed so you always have an escape route, you just need to be creative and never stand still.Oh, the SWORD. Period.GRAPHICSNew Engine looks great, I think the biggest improvement is that you can see the damage you are doing to every demon, pieces of flesh fly out of their bodies when you shoot them, you leave exposed bone and tissue. The blood looks better.And in general there are some levels that make you say “Wow this looks very good” there is even a level at the end, that a door opens and I literally thought “Amazing” and the AI that is with you the entire trip says something “I know right, looks amazing”. Great job there.STORYThis is the first DOOM game where I actually cared about the Story, not only that, you no longer have to rely absolutely on the CODEX to learn about the world. There is carefully crafted story, you can follow up no matter what. Sure, there are some things and flashbacks to real DOOM fans out there. But in general, is a good story, you get to see unfold. The bosses and priests all have great voice acting. And it made me want to check the codex very often to improve the information.By the time you are in the last couple of missions, you WANT to know more, you WANT to see more flashbacks and understand the way this world works. The explanations on Argent Energy, Hell and Earth, they are all very interesting.SOUND / MUSICI played with a 7.1 Headset all the time, and the sound is spotless. You can listen every little thing that happens, from demons getting obliterated, to the chain in the Meat Hook. Even the little flame and embers of your flamethrower.The music is exactly what you are expecting if you are a fan of the Heavy Metal DOOM 2016. Boy you will be pleased here. Is so satisfying to hear the tunes while you are killing demons, and the careful way the tunes fade out once you managed to kill them all and get out of danger.OVERALLThis game is a 9/10 for me. I do not use a perfect score because I think there are some improvements in pacing. For the first two thirds of the game you fell the progress, but by the last 3 missions the levels are basically designed to throw you every upgrade and consumable you missed. I played on a 100% exploration run and my suit was pretty much upgraded by when I was about 70% of the campaign, and I am sad to say that there are more upgrades on the map, than the ones you need to be 100%. I would have liked a more calculated experience. If you want a 100% suit and weapon upgrades, you need to do 100% combat and exploration on every level."

158,Samsonatlanta,"Apr  9, 2020",10,"This is a very biased review of course, but this is my favorite game ever made. I will happily explain why, and having going back to playing Doom 2016 for an hour today, it is actually weird how many negative things I notice that I haven't before about the game. So far, I've doubled my playtime in Eternal (122 hours at the moment) compared to 62 over the past 4 years in 2016. Now: what makes the game good, in my opinion, and what are my responses to the criticisms? Gorgeous art direction. If you go back and replay Doom 2016, take a look at nearly every area in the entirety of that game. It looks identical to Doom 3, for all of the **** that people give that game. Doom Eternal expands on the ideas of the OG games, opting for epic landscapes and portrayals that I've always wanted out of Doom 2: Hell On Earth as a young kid. Without spoiling anything, within the 14 levels you never go to the same place twice. I don't think this'll count as spoilers, so I'll include the list: Hell On Earth with city landscapes and various architecture and cool **** for story reasons I won't say, we go to the Sentinel homeworld with the gorgeous trees and medieval castles, go to the general pits of Hell, where the consumption of Earth's architecture has been rooted. You go to the icy northern parts of Earth with various architecture from a faction, you go to the more barren mountainous and foggy very industrial complex hosting a major enemy, you go to the ""Super Gore Nest"" (give it a Google), you go the heart of the resistance and other story bits, as well as major enemy, you go to Phobos' UAC sci-fi complex with the BFG 10k, you go to the outer destroyed surface of mars and various floaty bits left behind, you go to the hellish corrupted core (with some sick **** setpieces man), you go to the more regal portions of the Sentinel world, you go to the absolutely horrid factory deposits of hell and such a banger **** song, and ""Urdak"" (a unique heaven thing, it's pretty cool). Enemy variety, of course, is superb. Now, this isn't 2016; you can't kill everything with the double barrel shotgun like a wild goose. This game is hard. It's actually quite similar to chess (I know, super cliche analogy), but if you don't learn the mechanics it'll kick your ass."
159,skads7,"Apr  9, 2020",9,"Solo vengo a escribir que el que le ponga una nota negativa es retrasado y por culpa de gente así, nos comemos todos los años un Call of Duty, un Pokémon y derivados. Es un juego excelente y me lo he pasado de maravilla con él. Doom en su máximo esplendor. ¿Qué pasa? No es lo suficientemente clásico para ti? No te preocupes, bájate el Zdoom y uno o varios de los 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 wads que hay, que seguro que no te aburres."

161,kring,"Apr 13, 2020",10,"Exactly what I expected... and more!   this game is great, worth every penny, especially compared to the flow of games coming out over the last few years which fall short or appear rushed. Also - this is a single player game, and what I rate on. not that interested in MP. Pros: Performance, bug free, story, graphics quality is exceptional, Frame rate. Cons: The ammo availability is too little; results in less shoot'em up, more scrounging around"
162,Ohmyhellcry,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"This is one of the best games I've ever had honor to play. Gunplay is amazing, soundtrack is awesome, platforming is suprisingly really good. Story is chapter for itself, they Made a game almost without any lore into fantastic space opera. Dont understand the crybabies here at all, thank you ID, keep up the great work. Looking foward to dlcs"
163,ImpossPlayz,"Apr 16, 2020",9,"The game is really fun. The main negative parts for this game I see is the platforming, ammo, and multiplayer.First off, platforming isn't difficult neither is it plentiful. The only level with a lot of platforming is Urdak, and even in that level 80% is run and gun shooting.Now onto ammo. Maximum ammo amounts in this game are low, yes (maximum 60 shells in Doom 2016 and 24 shells in this game), but you can easily chainsaw a fodder demon to get your ammo up. So I don't really understand those reviews.Now onto multiplayer. As of the time of writing, the only multiplayer mode is Battlemode. Not sure if the developers will release any other modes, but that's beside the point. Battlemode is probably the only slightly bad part of this game. I had fun in it for about ~10 hours, then it got repetitive and boring. The main issue with the game's multiplayer is the lack of modes. One mode just isn't enough.Overall it's a really good fps game, as good or possibly better than rival games like Halo. Highly recommend buying if you are into metal music and fast-paced games, full of action and gore."
164,Alan_Ocean,"Apr 16, 2020",9,"DOOM Eternal is like your older cousin who had tons of cool stuff, and you got to brag about how cool he was. While others played Half-Life Alyx, I grinded every single part of DOOM Eternal until my eyes grew sore from dismembering demons."
165,Leonardo_X,"Apr 24, 2020",9,"The best fps today, its mechanics is almost perfect since the dash and the tubes that allow you to hang yourself, also the artificial intelligence that is more aggressive and that forces you to move from one side to the other is incredible and make the gameplay It is much more aggressive and frantic than the previous doom (2016), its music is totally incredible in each situation you hear it at each level, the story is not very well done but it is fine, since in a game like doom, the story It's not that important. If you are not sure of buying the game, there is no other way, but to spoil the story by watching other people's gameplays, since apparently there are people who bought the game without knowing what was going to come in the game or what They knew and that's why they complain that `` It was not what I expected '' and other absurd things like that, when in the quake-con and E3 they showed in gameplays that the dash and the tubes to hang you, among other things, were already implemented in the game . It is one thing to say that you do not like mechanics and your opinion is well respected, but another thing to say the game is horrible just because you do not like it or because yes, that is to be mediocre."
166,Brunn0121,"May  6, 2020",9,"OUTSTANDING!Rip and tear, until it is done.Amazing gameplay, smooth as butter engine and an actual plot this time around, don't waste your time, go buy the game!"
167,SoupAndSauce,"May 19, 2020",9,"ID took an absolutely incredible game, (DOOM 2016) and somehow made it better in every way. The map design is amazing. the arenas are fun and allow lots of mobility so you can jump, dash, and swing while crushing demons. And the parts of the game where you're not fighting are beautiful and filled with Easter eggs and secrets. The combat and resource management is prefect. Each weapon has a propose and can be used to get a huge advantage over some demons. The chainsaw allows you to always have enough ammo as long as you play the right way without letting you abuse the chaingun or plasma rifle as well as making you more aware of where your shots go. Visually this game is also amazing. More cartooney than 2016 in some ways but the sky boxes are some of the best I've seen and Nekravol and Urdak were so fun to look at. The enemies in this game are awesome. The fodder allow you to regain health and ammo but can still get some solid hits in if you're distracted by a heavy demon. A lot of people hate the Marauder but he's one of the funnest enemies to fight. You have to keep your eyes on him at all times but you also have to make sure you're not being distracted. The soundtrack is dope as **** and I actually liked some of the non metal like the music in Urdak. The multiplayer is ehh. Not for me. But I did'n't buy a DOOM game for the multiplayer. Although I do think an arena shooter would be a good addition. All in all an incredible game that I love just as much if not more that 2016 ans the original DOOM's. probably best played on Nightmare if you can handle it. Very mu7ch looking forward to the DLC's."
168,Jackermy,"May 23, 2020",10,"So, this game does not look like DOOM 2016, but this game is just awesome. It got a lot of new features to diversify your game experience. We got picturesque views,  different locations that were missed in DOOM 2016. The setting looks like an old DOOM was upgraded in 2020. Also, we got new weapons,  new demons, a lot of bosses and mini-bosses, upgrades for them, a lot of new collectibles, and ""side quests"". Also, we got quite a good plot that founded on the bible.  The gameplay is different, we got parkour, puzzles, and certainly fights that look awesome. Fights became faster, we got a lot of ways to kill the demons.In conclusion, I want to say that this game is cool, and maybe this is the best shooter of the new decade, but you should play in it like a new chapter but not a sequel."
169,mr-NachoMen,"May 25, 2020",10,"DOOM Eternal is a great sequel to 20016's DOOM and one of the best games i have played so far!!! I constantly compare DOOM eternal to films like Evil Dead 2 and Hostel part 2 in the way that they are all sequels but at the same time acts like soft reboots by changing some elements like the tone or genre.This time around DOOM Eternal focus more into telling a story that for being honest it is actually descent and the game manage to balance both gameplay and story, something that DOOM 3 couldn't properly manage.As the previous game, DOOM eternal features the same frenetic fast paced action and combat and it adds a couple of new features like dash, a flame thrower and a grenade that can be switched to an ice grenade. Glorious kills makes a comeback as well the chainsaw.The level design was made with the intention to add multiple ways to engage the enemy and with the goal to encourage the player to explore every corner in search of ester eggs and hidden secrets like toys, tracks from the soundtrack and cheat codes and other features that can help you upgrading your suit for better abilities.The game features a new mechanic which is the ""permadeath"" it is obvious that if you die you'll be punished to start from the beginning, that's why exploring the levels is crucial to find extra lifes that will keep you going trough the game cuz you'll going to need them... the game gets harder and harder the more you progress.Now let's move to the negative point of the game which for me it's only one... platforming sections!!! those are unnecessary and annoying, why did ID Software add this?In my whole time playing DOOM i only encounter one crash that got easily fixed by only lowering one specific setting... something that has the word ""pool"" on it.Moving to the performance, i've heard that is a really demanding game overall, sadly i cannot say that as i didn't test it on other rigs. For me the game ran pretty well with a solid framerate using the ultra nightmare settings on a GTX 1080 Ti, and i got amazed that my pc ran pretty cold, considering that i have a pretty mediocre cooling system, maybe the game is well optimized? it can be.The visuals does not disappoint, the game  has some really cool lighting and particle effects, animations are fluent and the detail on the enemy wounded flesh looks nasty and bloody, really impressive what the new Id Tech 7 can achieve now.Let's see what the future holds for DOOM."
170,danim_off,"Jun  7, 2020",9,Goog game! Gemeplay in doom enternal is really good!!! This game deserves your attention.
171,ziOmSoN,"Dec 28, 2020",10,"Way better than the DOOM (2016). Maybe Multiplayer is boring, but the campaign is awsome."
172,kyzr,"Apr  1, 2020",8,"Doom 2016 and this doom are essentially the same game with slightly improved mechanics, graphics and lacatsi. Those who complain about the complexity of the game just do not know how to play, I went through a doom in 2016 and this one is at the maximum level of difficulty and I can say that in addition to the cartridges there is nothing complicated, and then the developers thought about it and made the chainsaw rebuild and you could get damages from demons and me very rarely had problems with cartridges, but even if it’s so hard for you to play with so much damage (which’s very funny), it’s not worth putting the game 0/10. There is still a problem with narrow rooms, but they are in the whole game very few therefore it is not oh really big minus"
173,HyperSGYT,"Apr  7, 2020",9,"ESPAÑOL: Doom Eternal es uno de los mejores FPS que podrás probar. Es rápido, desafiante, visceral y  con un nivel de detalle increible. En este juego no vas usar la superescopeta para absolutamente todo como un loco... no... este juego, como en los antiguos DOOM, se trata de pensar, ser rápido y utilizar bien tus recursos. DOOM Eternal busca que domines su forma de combate, que te hará cambiar de armas todo el tiempo dependiendo del demonio que aparezca y la situación. Sin darte cuenta actuarás de forma instintiva para poder salvar tu pellejo utilizando las armas adecuadas en un momento jodido. En ese momento, estas dominando la danza de DOOM. Junto a su increíble Gameplay, incluye una increíble campaña con unos niveles diseñados casi a la perfección junto a secciones de plataformas satisfactorias, y que expande el lore y la historia de doom como nunca antes, pero para los que solo quieren disparar, todo lo que incluye a la historia puede ser salteado, ya que algo secundario que el jugador elige abarcar o no, y se agradece. El multiplayer es probablemente la parte mas floja de este juego, ya que no tenemos mas a los modos de juego anteriores o al SnapMap, sino que tenemos al ""BATTLEMODE"", un modo en donde 1 Slayer y 2 Demonios (los 3 controlados por jugadores) pelean en diferentes rounds. Siento que este modo de juego no mantendrá vivo como para que la gente siga activa jugando, menos aun  cuando las únicas recompensas son XP para cosmeticos en una serie a lo Fortnite. EDIT: No he mencionado cosas de la campaña como las mejoras del traje, armas, etc, pero definitivamente hace que la progresión del juego sea igual de buena que la de la dificultad. En conclusión: DOOM ETERNAL de seguro se irá a los GOTY, como mejor juego o al menos como mejor OST, porque su gameplay es la evolución de la franquicia de Id Software, y sin dudas es 10 veces mejor que Doom 2016, que ahora al volver a ese juego, se queda atrás y parece un juego ""simple"", comparado a esto. Su multi es un poco decepcionante, y espero que cosas como SnapMap vuelvan al cast. No le doy el 10 por lo del Multi, pero probablemente tendría un 9,8 o 9,5 si no fuera porque Metacritic no me deja poner mas que 9. Saludos y compren este juego YA."
174,potwor1991,"Apr  7, 2020",9,"This game is almost a perfect FPS campaign, also I'd say that if you are a metalhead you HAVE to play this, even if you're not interested in games at all, this is an actual metal simulator! But jokes aside: from what I've seen, most complaints people have toward this game are: platforming, more linear levels, than in the previous installment and Marauders, so let me address those: If you really hate platforming, then you won't like it here, but imo it is as good, as it can get in an FPS game, that is not focusing on platforming per se, it provides breaks from the break-neck pace of the fighting sections and I kind of like it, it certainly don't ruin anything. As for the level design I must admit, that some of the levels are basically a straight line in their general structure, but there's so much stuff to do and discover throughout them, that they really don't feel much linear, when you play them and they are also waaay bigger then in 2016's. Lastly the infamous Marauders. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then basically there's this new enemy type that is kind of a unofficial boss and he requires you to dramatically change your approach for the time he's around, but really it's not that bad, as some people say, I've seen videos where people playing on a controller stunlock this dude to death, so git gud I guess. :D I'm not going to break down each and every new mechanic and tool and how it affects the game loop, I'll just say that there's a lot of new stuff, but it's all really smartly designed, everything has it's purpose and you really need to use all your tools and weapons this time around if you want to get through this game, as it's way harder then the previous one. Fortunately the devs did a great job in explaining how and why each element of the gameplay is important, like chainsawing for ammo, flame belching for armor and so on, so no one should get lost in this. Graphics are amazing, weapon and monster sounds are as metal, as the music (and omg the MUSIC, it deserves it's own review, really), general design of locations and everything else is out of this world and almost trippy ridiculous at times, but in a good sense. This installment is pretty story-heavy compared to the last one, and it has quite a few 3rd person cutscenes, some people liked the miinimalistic direction of D2016 better, but I don't mind the approach here, it all comes together nicely, especially if you read the codex along the way, which I recommend you do. Also the Battlemode, which obviously is not the focus of the game is pretty fun for couple of hours, once you get used to it, it's a nice addition. I really can't recommend this game enough, and I'm only giving it a 9, instead of 10, because of some minor visual bugs and the fact that sometimes, when you get out of a glory kill animation you can find yourself already surrounded by the enemies, which can kill you almost instantly, if you're on nightmare difficulty, which feels to me like a cheap death, this really shows how aggressive the AI is in this one. Basically, if you're an FPS fan of any sort you should try this game! And remember scores and reviews are temporary, but DOOM is ETERNAL. m/"
175,Cryptkeeperrr,"Apr 10, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Starting with the things I disliked, forcing people to use a Bethesda.net account isn't great (I didn't personally care too much but it should be a choice to have online turned off). The platforming got a bit stale but I really enjoyed it overall. The story (although not necessary for a Doom title in my opinion.) felt really boring and it felt like I was being forced  to read the codex's to understand what was going on. But you can play this game and have a great time without story. Lastly, the online, the experience felt shallow and unbalanced, and it could use some new modes. Onto the things I liked. I really loved the new cartoon-ish nature of the new art style, but it didn't take me out of the experience. The new glory kills were gory and really badass. The game felt challenging which is a nice change from 2016 (which I loved)  where you could just use the super shotgun the whole game.  The game forced you to learn how to use new weapons and manage health and ammo strategically. The world was great to look at with beautiful set pieces. The game felt smooth and well optimized which is rare for a Bethesda title! Lastly, the Mick Gordon soundtrack was great, each track felt unique and made ripping and tearing fell so much more satisfying. Overall this game is worth the money! It offers tons of content and replay value with challenging special game-modes."
176,Molinardo,"Apr 11, 2020",9,"Was really fun to play from beginning to end! took some time to adjust to stuff; like the smaller ammo count and platforming. But overall, it was worth the delay!"
177,Cadr,"Apr 23, 2020",10,If im honest this is probably the most fun fps I have played in a long time. I did not play Doom 2016 but after watching a few videos about this game I bought it and after playing it I did not regret that decision. I have not finished the game at the time of writing this but at this point in time I can still recommend this game to anyone that likes fast pace game play with nicely done platforming elements and beautiful gore. 10/10 even after running into some minor bugs.
178,Cyberwolf1989,"May 20, 2020",8,"Lemme just open this up by say that anyone who posts a negative review, or updates their game to a negative review, over the recent patch with Denuvo, is a **** idiot. That is NOT on this game, that is on Bethesda. Go to their social media and complain to them there. All you're doing by review bombing is **** all over the work of Hugo Martin and Id Software. Now for the review. It ain't perfect, but it comes close, and is a damn good follow up to 2016. The levels are structured greatly, and feel like larger versions of classic doom levels, chock ful of secrets. The collectibles are nice, which, combined with the platforming, makes it feel like Id trying their hand at a FPS version of Banjo Kazooie. Controls feel nice and tight. Onto the bad stuff. I might be in the minority, but I loved SnapMap in 2016. It's absence here makes Eternal feel a little bit smaller. I won't say there isn't replay value, because there is, but it can feel hollow after a while. Also, whoever made the decision to surround the center of my screen in red when I'm at low health, can you not? It makes it very hard to see in the somewhat darkened areas of the game. Otherwise though, I'm excited to see what the future holds for this game."
179,deepwater,"Nov  3, 2020",10,"Way better than what i expected. This one actually has some sort of meaning, not just mindless shooting. 7.7 is way too low score for this."
180,Cougargames,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"Aright so imagine DOOM 2016 but they added fun platforming to give you a break from the constant action, more strategy that requires you use every weapon for specefic enemies so that your mind is never bored of just using the same gun all the time, Imagine a bigger world filled with even more lore for the DOOM franchise and a longer campaign that will be around 22 hours long.You really cant go wrong here this is personally the best fps ive played in a very long time I would without a doubt give this game a 9.5/10"
181,ComputerGrenade,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"First! - The story is what doom needed, nothing that will slow down the experience.Second! - Oh my! the graphics are amazing, Doom 2016 graphics we're already amazing.Third! - Killing those demons is the most satisfying ever, ripping the demons eyes out is sooo! much fun.Forth - Jumping like a monkey is ALOT of fun.Verdict : 10.0"
182,Fireantus,"Mar 30, 2020",8,"I think I understand the negative huffing about this game - mostly because it is very different and requires a shift or perspective to enjoy. This might already ruffle people who just wanted MORE of DOOM'16 which was quite a blast. But Doom Eternal isn't a straightforward filling of the same ordeal, just bigger and nicer looking. It's a different beast. It's more... tactical. In Previous Game you could just sport Super Shotgun and literally never change your weapon. You could maybe sometimes smash that BFG button, but that's about it. ETERNAL allows this, but it warns you heavily, that this is a very hard approach and not a recommended one, since enemies now varies in which weapon and tactic is well suited for taking them down. It can be irritating, because it feels like the game forces you to play in the exact way the designers want you to. It feel a bit hand-holdy. It feel forced. AND YET, if you stop resisting, if you give in and accept their systems, the game is still unyieldingly fun and engaging. It just clicks at certain point. You will freeze a clump of mooks, put them alight with flamethrower, blast them with a few rockets and collect all that juice and armor, saving one mook for a chainsaw pinata for ammo. It becomes so fluid, so tense because of the ONSLAUGHT of demons matched only by their ferocity. You need to be faster. You need to make correct decision. You are given plenty of tools to tackle a problem, and you will discover that you can utilize various tactics still. Charge the heat blast for the plasma when dealing damage, taking that Hunter shield down when using the blast for heavy Crowd Control as it staggers and does big damage too... Dash to the side, switch to the Shotgun, blast some harassing heavy. Jump away, rocket launcher to punish that Pain Elemental in mid air with lock on rockets. Land with your heavy cannon ready with scope to chink off weapons of that mancubus... It's a beautiful dance, and for it, I really enjoyed the game."
183,MarcioCavalcant,"Mar 31, 2020",9,"PROS:+Amazing gameplay+Amazing soundtrack+Amazing exploration+great graphics+Crazy fun+lots of variety in both weapons and enemies CONS:-You're thrown inside a vague and cryptic story while the game focus on being multiplayer-oriented, given the leveling and reward system that has been set in place. So one could say the story is a little OFF, but nothing much."
184,Chronik808,"Apr  1, 2020",10,"Doom Eternal je dalším skvělým zástupcem stejnojmenné série, která je za mě nejlepší first person shooter na PC a každý by jej měl okusit. Vynikající audio, grafika vyhnána do extrému a optimalizace celé hry na jedničku. Suprová hratelnost zaručená značkou ID, trocha sentimentu i nostalgie mile překvapuje celým průběhem hry. Démoni a další démoni k zabíjení! Doom je čistá řežba a dlouho zůstane na vrcholu akčních her.Na konec musím jen vypíchanou slabší multiplayer, velmi málo herních módů což je škoda, uvidíme zda něco kluci přidají,... a v celé hře chybí destrukce skla.

185,mlok_Karel,"Apr  2, 2020",9,"It is a different game than Doom 2016 was, that's for sure.The platforming caught me off guard and it took me quite some time to get along. I've died many more times by falling than by being killed by demons, yet now I actually enjoy it. It is fun, after all. There are many secret areas that show on your automap, yet actually getting to them isn't always easy. It's not impossible either, tho!I was disappointed by the low ammo storage (even when fully upgraded!) but after some time learnt how to deal with it (chainsaw is the obvious answer, along with using all of your arsenal.That's getting us to my main complaint - it doesn't work so well with the necessity to use specific weapons against specific demons. It kinda destroys Doomguy's creativity. And the story & lore I really love! I've read most of the codex entries and watched most of the YouTube theories videos. I can only hope it will expand with the upcoming DLCs.It is true the game is somewhat dumbed down and the ""legal"" in-game cheats weren't necessary, TBH... But it's up to you, after all, nobody forces you to use them.The campaign was a little too short for me my liking, but leet's hope the DLCs will cover that as well.I don't care at all about multiplayer, so not rating that. Overall, I liked it and I'm glad it wasn't a simple copy of 2016, which many people would like more, as it seems."

187,lossyinput,"Apr 12, 2020",9,"Eternal is a great game, but you should come into it with the mindset that this is not the same game as Doom 2016. It's much harder and heavily rewards mastery of its mechanics, offering new challenges that expand on those found in the last entry. There's many new features and tools given to you that at first can seem overwhelming, but use them correctly and you'll find yourself performing a beautiful ballet of demon genocide. Combine that with the great art direction and yet another amazing soundtrack from Mick Gordon and it's no surprise that this is one of the most intense and rewarding FPS games I've ever played."
188,whytho7,"Apr 17, 2020",10,"Fantastic Game, Very fun, Metal as ****. Go out and buy this game. No need to say anymore"
189,TheHambro,"Apr 26, 2020",9,"What can I say about Doom Eternal?  It’s a very worthy sequel to the 2016 title with even more fast-paced, guns a' blazin', demon slayin’ gameplay with some neat platforming thrown in the mix.  If you are a fan of the previous title (or Doom in general), then this is a must buy. Although there are now some more story elements and platforming involved, the gameplay remains the bread and butter.  I implore anyone to play this on the harder difficulties (at the very least on Ultra Violence) because it will force you to learn all the tools at your disposal, your enemies’ weaknesses, and really make you think what weapon to use for each situation and what enemies you want to take out first, which makes every fight an intense and thrilling one.  You might come out of each battle just barely alive, but it’s incredibly fun and rewarding when you come out on top.  Best of all, it does a fantastic job of making you feel like this unrelenting force; it’s pure bliss.  The game does a great job of breaking up each fight with a little bit of story, some really fluid and fun platforming, and of course, exploration to find collectibles and upgrades.  The story is no way intrusive, you can dive into the lore as much as you want or get right into the action.  The story is there to serve one purpose, and that is to show just how much of a badass the Doom Slayer is. My only critique is the aesthetics of the menus and HUD.  It’s a lot more colorful and vibrant this time around, but I prefer Doom 2016’s menus.  I didn’t mind it and was never distracting at any point, but it’s just something to take note of. Doom Eternal is just an awesome game.  You can clearly see how much passion went into making this.  Everything from the graphics, music, gameplay, story and everything else is just so well done and on point.  Do yourself a favor, and pick this one up!"
190,Mossyrocks,"Apr 29, 2020",9,"A great game if you are cooped up in quarantine. Not so hard as to push people away, but challenging enough to make winning and pulling off things like combos rewarding. It could have calmed down with the cutscenes and cleaned the story more but the actual ‘game’ part is great."
191,OtoniPedro,"May  5, 2020",9,"This game is a masterpiece. Looks awesome. The action is awesome. It is very nostalgic with many references from the 90s games and the game itself is a tribute to the game that made FPS be what it is today. So much that you can actually play it in Doom Eternal, though it is hidden. The lore is cool, but I dont think they should with that night sentinel medieval thing too much. I think they should stick with the futuristic space marine with big badass guns thing vs demons and all sorts of unholy evil creatures stuff. The ambience, immersion, and tension is better with DOOM 2016. Doom Eternal also made me feel tense whe  playing the first playthrough, but not because of huge immersion and dark things happening there, but because i knew this game was harder and the many ways it could just screw me throwing multiple enemies with new and daring mechanics all at once. It was a thrill because i knew it is chalenging ad tha would require much from me. But this game still does a great job, though with a different aproach to that. Too many mechanics should overwhelm some people, but i think the core audience just loves it. Particularly the dash I use all the time because im required to in order to dominate the combat, but i dont like it. Makes it feel like playing Tracer from Overwatch, which has a totally different feel to every Doom game. I dislike that and would like to play Doom just with that awesome classic really fast pacing Doomguy's regular walk has. Also having monkeybars around every corner further breaks immersion and doesnt feel like it's something that belongs there. The action is good, but it doesnt feel right. Battlemode i found a bit sucky. I usually just play it to complete events and thats it. DOOM 2016 had a much better multiplayer. I reckon they didnt follow the same model so people would maybe go to Quake Champions for that. There a few bugs, most of them seems to be visual. Skins dont work very properly. If u wanna make ur skins work right for aome reason u gotta switch off the weapon skins. They have a really good variety of skins both at the present but also upcoming for a game that doesnt monetise that. Anyways best action I ever had the pleasure of playing. Best FPS I ever played along with Doom 2016. Both this and DOOM 2016 each with a different feel, although most of it is the same."
192,Bluespell1,"May 18, 2020",9,The game is a blast to play. bouncing around and blasting demons and watching them explode is satisfying. The music is just great. there in my eyes is not much better then this game.
193,Charnooh,"Dec 27, 2020",8,"This is a great game. Doom 2016 felt exactly like doom but with modern graphics, which means the game design was 20 years old, and it really showed. You lacked mobility, everything was muddy, and sometimes you had to walk around the whole map in cicrcles. This game is everything a modern Doom should be, and feels as if the series got regular entries throughout the years and got better every time. There are much more weapons than last time, and each of them has a usecase. The art and sound direction are insane (the Makyr chapter is one of the most mesmerizing levels I've seen in a shooter, only being beaten by Zen in Black Mesa). I'd say the quality here is on par or even better than Titanfall 2. I'm judging it for the singleplayer only, I have no interest in playing the multiplayter. I get that people are angry because of some anticheat update, but it's certainly not a 0/10 because of that update. Just unreasonably angry boycotting imo."
194,Ergosphere3,"Apr 18, 2020",10,"Absolute masterpiece in summary. Doom Eternal is the perfect sequel to Doom (2016) my only astronomically small nit-picky problem is that they didn't use BFG Division in the soundtrack as much.Keep up the amazing work ID, you never fail to surprise me every new release."
195,Bestafer,"Apr 23, 2020",10,"Es buen juego, con una historia mas profunda que relata los origenes y las motivaciones del doom slayer."
196,Rick96,"Apr 24, 2020",10,"Pedazo de shooter!!.. frenético como ningún otro me recuerda un poco al Shadow Warriors 2 en su jugabilidad me encanta la agresividad desmesurada, la ira de doomguy y el frenetismo del juego ID software se supo reinventar... es la revoluciona de los juegos en toda regla te sientes como todo un castigador de demonios y mas si lo juegas a la máxima dificultad El Sountrack en algunas pistas se nota que están tocadas por el  propio Mick Gordon otras no tantoaun me sigue pareciendo mas épico el ost del 2016 aunque tampoco es un trabajo mediocre ni mucho menos de este ost saco un par de canciones que me encantaron no hagan caso de el montón de haters que hay puntuando el juego con baja calificación es gente débil, Amargada, lenta y frustrada que quedo viviendo en el pasado acostumbrada a jugar juegos mas de estarse quieto mientras disparas y les quedo grande el manejo y la cantidad de  frenetismo necesario para este titulo ya que en el anterior aunque te movías para no morir al lado del Eternal se queda en pañales solo digo una cosa JUEGUENLO POR USTEDES MISMOS y saquen sus propias conclusiones."
197,Benjauttt,"Apr 24, 2020",10,"Un excelente juego con gran manejabilidad y que se disfruta mucho a cada momento, unos gráficos increíbles y que no es apto para mucha gente gatillo fácil, porque no solo es disparar sino pensar rápido y moverte mucho, osea, saber cómo atacar, me encanta este juego, sin duda uno de los mejores del año."
198,rickyb100,"Mar 31, 2020",10,"Doom Eternal is the best game in the series, with fresh and original new game mechanics, an intriguing yet ignorable story, some of the best combat in any FPS ever, loads of challenges and new demons, as well as tons of replay ability. It even manages to introduce a fun and interesting multiplayer game called battle mode, however the multiplayer needs more diversity in terms of game play. Story: Like every other game in the DOOM Franchise, Eternal’s story is ignorable and most likely won’t effect your gameplay. However, players interested in looking into the lore will be MORE than satisfied, with jaw dropping plot twists (which I wouldn’t dare spoil) and interesting background and history on every location and entity in the game, as well as the histories of the sentinels, demons, and the earth itself. Although the lore isn’t worked into the game as well as it could be, but it’s a DOOM game. You didn’t come for the story and ID Software knows that. Gameplay: ID software has ruined the gameplay of DOOM (2016) for me... because they improved upon it in every single way. The gunplay is tight and precise, the weapons are explosive and satisfying, and the gore has been turned up from 10/10 to 12/10, with brand new unique glory kills for bosses and enemies. Every encounter with enemies feels like a puzzle as you quickly strategize your next move running through break neck speed. Levels: DOOM 2016’s campaign began to grow stale and repetitive in the third act, however you’ll see nothing like that in DOOM Eternal, as every level feels fresh and unique from the plains of hell itself, to the corrupted Earth, as well as the home worlds of the sentinels, and the maykrs. Being pact with dozens of fantastic secrets such as floppy disc’s with classic soundtracks from ID Games. However the final level of the game: “Final Sin” lacks on the Creative Side, it MORE than makes up for it with the fantastic final boss. Enemies and Bosses: The enemies are diverse and unique, broken down into four classes. Each enemy brings a unique challenge (excluding fodder enemies) that you must account for in the arena like battles.As for the bosses, the bosses are unique and challenging. To put it simply they “teach you how to play DOOM correctly.” As each boss brutally examines you on everything you’ve learned up to that  point in the game. Each of the five bosses manage to keep the gameplay fresh to the very end, with the monstrous final boss being an “epic battle of biblical proportions”. Rewards: DOOM Eternal is incredibly rewarding, giving players skins, weapon power ups, cheat codes, and classic music for exploring and completing the game. Eternal also introduces a leveling up progression system that awards you xp based on your performance, completion, and exploration in the campaign and multiplayer that gives you access to titles, profile pics, backgrounds and victory poses as well as additional creative weapons/player skins. Most importantly though is that completion and exploration of the game awards you a copy of Classic Doom and Doom II (I’ll explain in the next paragraph) Replay-ability: After you’ve finished the campaign enjoy playing the game on higher difficulties as well as the intense and challenging “extra life mode” which puts an old school twist in a modern shooter, as well as the merciless and unholy “Ultra Nightmare” mode that’ll send you through hell and back. Players can also grind through the level progression system to get all level up perks and rewards. If you’ve found enough secrets you can also return to the hub world, the ""Fortress of Doom"" after completing the final level you're awarded a classic model MS DOS computer that contains a full port of THE Classic Doom and Doom II. That’s right, you get to play Doom in DOOM as reward for exploring and completing the game. Multiplayer: The multiplayer is the weakest part of the game. However that’s not to say it’s bad, it’s a creative, fun, and original multiplayer game mode... and at the moment the ONLY multiplayer game mode in Doom Eternal. Eternal introduces the new Battlemode that sees you and two other players duke it out in an arena, one plays as the DOOM Slayer himself, as the other two take control of a heavy class demon as they engage in an epic battle to slay the Slayer. Although battle mode is a good multiplayer mode, getting classical multiplayer modes such as death match will definitely be necessary to keep fans playing Eternal. Conclusion: 9.75/10 (Rounded up to 10/10) DOOM Eternal is not just one of the best shooters in years, but one of the best shooters of ALL TIME. Including an original and epic campaign, new mechanics, an original multiplayer mode, loads of replay-ability, and it’s overall just a fantastic time. As soon as that opening cutscene rolls, the only thing you’re going to want to do is... RIP and TEAR... until it is done."

GO PLAY CALL OF DUTY yeah I get it! The platformings sometimes get boring and hud is more cartoonish but dashing and jumping around while blasting through demons is fun af. And if you spend sometime reading those codexes you'll get the story. You just want something easy with a predictable story telling system. Finally we have an EXPLANATION for the DOOM and you're angry?It's a both a CLASSIC and MODERN DOOMHave a problem with difficulty go fuqing play another game where they'll bless you with ammo and it's EASYIt's Doom. It's main joy is in playing it on nightmare difficultly. GO ON CALL THIS GAME TRASH BECAUSE YOU CANT PLAY IT AND IT IS HARD FOR YOUR LAZY FORTNITE LOVER ASS.

206,Muismi,"Apr 28, 2020",10,"DOOM Eternal es sin lugar a dudas un golpe de efecto en el año 2020, se ha publicado sin retrasos, a pesar del COVID-19, un juego que viene a divertirnos en una época tan dura. El juego mejora absolutamente en todo con respecto al anterior, escenarios, profundidad, personalización, gráficos y motor gráfico, dinamismo, variedad de enemigos, nuevas mecánicas, y un largo etcétera. Sinceramente el review boombing que está recibiendo me parece penoso, yo le otorgado el 10 de nota porque creo que merece eso y más, si al DOOM (2016) le di un 9, éste debería de tener un 12. Pero siempre ocurre que a los aficionados les cueta aceptar los cambios y quieren la misma fórmula una y otra vez, pero sobre Bethesda hay que decir que ha ido con todo, ha apostado muy fuerte y les ha salido un juego magnifico, que creo que en realidad le gusta a los fans que son realistas y al nuevo público que se están interesando por la saga DOOM en general. Lo recomiendo al 100%, antes de juzgar recomiendo jugarlo, porque la trama se desarrolla escalonadamente y el climax evidentemente está en el final."
207,buka3750,"May  2, 2020",10,The game is awesome in my eyes. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion so don't see bad reviews and just not buy the game. Sure the game has its good and bad points the platforming does get annoying at some points but it doesn't ruin the game in my eyes. The fighting is fun and the enemies do stick in your face but it makes the game more fast pace and makes you stay on your toes and be on the best of your game making the gun-play a lot more chaotic and fun. I think the developers did a good job on the game. Overall i think it is well around an awesome game and you should try it. Weather you try it at a friends house to see if you like it before buying the game or you buy it and then try it. You will get your moneys worth out of the game.
208,GrafRoss,"Apr  8, 2020",10,"Просто отличная игра, прошёл с удовольствием на кошмаре, попутно находя все секреты, кто хочет проверить свои нервы и получить реально удовольствие от этой игры, проходить только на кошмаре!"
209,Reloadead95,"Apr 10, 2020",10,"Это просто лучший шутер десятилетия. Проходил игру с огромным удовольствием. Бешеный темп боя, огромная масса оружия и разных врагов. Возможность разместить оружие по центру экрана. Просто шикарно. 10/10"
210,Wienerboi10,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"The sequel it actually deserves. Platforming was easy, but there more a lot of it which I don't mind. Combat is really intense and butt clenching in each of its own terms. Storytelling was greatly understandable (esp in codex) and it really doesn't take the game away. The only thing that I find kinda sad was that you could kinda see who the Doom Slayer is at this point. I wanted him to be a big mystery of a superhuman. Now for all these people that complain that so many has changed in Doom Eternal. It was for the betterment of it. Mainly because its a sequel meant for more varieties to happen. The devs were right, they doubled down as many things could happen compared to 2016. I don't see myself going back to 2016 for the gist of it as well. Its like improvement is being bad for you doomers who can't even get good in this game. People rant about the AMMO, in all honesty there are many scattered ammos around arenas, even the respawning fodders of which you could chainsaw. ""The chainsaw became a reload weapon."" Since when has it not? You have to use the chainsaw effieciently during your battles. Not when all your weapon ammos are depleted. Hence it refuels quickly. Don't get your arse stuck up when everythings low because you've got the mentality of only using it on occasions. 2016 basically has too many ammo that you just constantly use one weapon most of the time, aka super shotgun. Doom Eternal teaches you to use the each of your weapons which makes your gameplay more fluid than ever. I can't believe you guys just can''t handle what weapon is necessary for each and every demon. If you properly use your ammo resources, then you'll still have a lot in the end of the combat. The MARAUDERS are there to show off your skills if you can take this demon down instantly. Shooting him brainlessly punishes you to die. This demon basically controls the arena where the others won't, thats why hes so unique. The mf is basically your demonized reflection. ""BuT dOoM is SuPpOseD tO be a FaSt pAcE gAMe"" Yeah if you actually learn how to beat the Marauder, you'd beat him in less than 20sec tops. Hell, prolly even 10. Here's a tip, stay mid-range from him and super shotgun or ballista him when hes near. Don't shoot his shield for crying out loud. The wolf only comes out when you do it. That''s why you never shoot brainlessly. Level Designs are too complex? Excuse me but I remembered 2016 to be too dull and repetitive considering its just full on red. Its also tight in many combat areas where theres no free flow to roam around in. Even if the platform is like Mario, I would never doubt you that you couldn't finish them. They're easy to bypass and understandable. Atmosphere felt in place as well considering each level designs are very different from one another. Punching does nothing? Blood punch basically destroys most of the enemies in Eternal. Maybe you people forget that theres such a thing as that one. If you people can't comprehend the amount of throwables at your hand, then you're not thinking through and through on your gameplay, no wonder why you love 2016 so much. Its not even required for you to use them, considering you control what you play, but its necessary to use these to help your combat. For the story, I have no saying of it considering I like it, but many do, I do not know why but its everyones perspective. I guess people really want realistically looking games, how does cartoonish graphics make the game look more ugly? Even Doom 2016 was easy to beat to why I kinda got bored to it. Nightmare you say? that doesn't spice things too much even that one was okay to deal with. Doom Eternal's difficulty is rewarding and great. Even if i lost, Ive had extra lives in my hands and it rewards you into becoming an actual Slayer. In all honesty I think the people who whine are the ones who can't see themselves playing hardcore action skilled fps games at all. These people can't handle quick thinking and just blatantly relies on going all on no mind process shooting. Go back to call of duty if that's what you're after if you want simple repetitive game mechanics. Its you who has a problem with the game, not the game itself."

214,sir___,"Apr 21, 2020",10,doom for me is just one of those games that makes me feel like all I want to do is play. If i dye I find myself running right back in with no hesitation because all I want to do is rip and tear

216,O-Boi,"Apr 24, 2020",10,"There is no way in hell, (see what I did there) this game is worse than Doom 2016. There is more enemy variety, The levels are large and sprawling with demons,  the environments are beautiful and more color variety when it comes to the environments too. The enemies weaknesses are very clear to understand and I enjoy quick switching between weapons. This game challenging yet rewarding, Because there is less ammo you have balance all your tools in order to beat this game. The best way to stay alive is too move and keep killing demons, as it should be and and the action only slows down in between fighting arenas and even in between levels there are tough enemies to fight too. I see a lot of people complain about it not having enough ammo. Well that is what the chainsaw is for. the chainsaw has a cool down because you will need it a lot. It seems that the people that are giving this game bad reviews because they don't know how to play it. If they would try to learn the game more maybe they would enjoy it more."

220,sihs,"Apr  7, 2020",9,"TL;DR : DOOM ETERNAL is brilliant and you should play it, NOW. (but first, look up some gameplay, and don't come there to complain about the platforming). This game is an absolute masterpiece.It has everything the previous games have, improves on many aspects, and might be the best shooter i've ever played, period. Pros :- The mobility! What lacked in speed in DOOM 2016 and in verticality in DOOM and DOOM2 is now perfectly implemented with the use of double jumps, double dash, monkey bars, wall climbing and THAT BLOODY MEAT HOOK!!! (aka the best grappling hook that a game has ever given me) - The level design is amazing! It feels so much less linear than in the previous opus in the series, and the fact that it's not in cramped industrial facilities makes roaming these incredibly huge maps an absolute delight. Some people may prefer the more futuristico-realistic setting of the 2016 DOOM, but I think it's much better to see more of the worlds. - The weapons have all been overhauled, both visually and from a sound/feeling standpoint (with two exceptions, i'll be back to that later). No more pistol. All doom games had this useless pistol, but now it's been replaced by a shotgun. This is a true Brutal-Doom fan's dream. The useless mods (rotating minigun barrel, shock bomb, scoped rifle, and triple-shot shotgun) have either been replaced or enhanced (full-auto shotgun, ice bomb as an equipment, the scoped rifle is now a sniper rifle, etc.). Even though I prefered some previous designs and weapons (the minigun, and the Gauss cannon instead of the Ballista), all weapons feel fantastic and are now unique. - The music is bloody amazing. It's like listening to a metal album while playing the metal album. Everything in the music is so polished, it's just incredible. Some may say that there are fewer memorable tracks, but that's because the combats are so much more intense you literally can't afford to pay attention to other things. - Speaking of combat, the combat in DOOM 2016 was brilliant, but you didn't need to micro-manage your ammo and health as much as in the original games. In Eternal, the combat feels like ballet. Heavy metal ballet. With big guns.The combat in 2016 also lacked mobility and it was especially slowed down by the fact that there was a maximum amount of demons in a single room at a given time (12, iirc). In Eternal, it's rare to find fewer than 12 demons in your close vicinity, and... - ...Since the bestiary is now double, or even triple the size of the previous game's, the variety in demons pushes the pacing up to 9000. - IT TOOK THEM 25 YEARS, BUT THEY FINALLY MADE A CYBERDEMON 3D MODEL THAT IS FAITHFUL TO THE ORIGINAL! And it's not even a boss! They made it a regular enemy! Speaking of that, all the bosses are in fact first encounters of normal enemies! And that's great because it spices up the combat so much! - This whole section is a mild spoiler, so don't read it if you're concerned about being spoiled.The Marauder : some hate it, I personally think it's the best enemy in the game. Imagine being in a stressful fight, and then a Marauder comes: you now have to think strategically and plan which demon to kill first, whilst paying attention to the Marauder's moves. It spices up the combat and most importantly, it teaches you a different way to play the game.Playing like in doom 2016 won't do you any good, because if you want to be efficient against the bigger enemies in Eternal, you NEED to be in constant movement, and you NEED to know and master the quick-switching. And before you meet the Marauder, you don't know any of that. It's brilliant. - The story is great and you can finally skip the cutscenes! (most of them, anyway). And now there's lore! And they even managed to connect pretty much all doom games! - Nightmare mode doesn't *just"" deal extra damage, it actually speeds up the game, makes the enemies more aggressive, and makes lesser demons spawn more. That's the best overhaul to the difficulty system that i've ever seen in a game. Cons:- Okay, some of the platforming is a bit unneccessary. Especially in the second level, or the Doom Hunter base. - The game is much more arcady, and that might be unpleasant to some (ie, the loud ""pop"" noise when you headshot a demon, or the glowy pickups, or the floating guns. I'm not a huge fan of these, as I prefered 2016's more ""cinematic/realistic"" approach. But i guess it's more faithful to the original games. Eh. - The BFG and another super-weapon that I won't name shares the same ammo, and the same weapon wheel slot. The issue is that you don't pickup BFG ammo in early maps, and it's very scarce in the late game, so you don't get to play with the super-weapons as much as you could in the previous titles in the series. What a shame. - Batllemode with friends won't work on the Bethesda.net version, because there is no friends list in that **** launcher. F* you, Bethesda."

We are so lucky that it isn't. It's so much more! Some people said ""If i wanted to play platform games, i would play Mario"". Don't be that person and then you will have lots of fun and challenge, mainly in the higher difficulties, which i recommend. Sometimes it feels heavy and too intense, these times don't be ashamed to take a break, i needed sometimes. Some times i thought that i would not be able to pass certain demon or area, but i think that the creators made something similar to the Dark Souls idea, you need to learn the patterns of the enemies and know your weapons, have no mercy, use everything that you have, and you will be rewarded. Doom Eternal is absolutely one of the best games i've ever played, one of my favorite, like Doom 2016, it's a hell of a evolution of the Doom Formula and i can't wait for the next!"

227,Holadayc,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"Truly one of my favorite games of all time. This is the standard all other modern games should be held to. If you are considering buying Doom Eternal, just do it. You will not regret it, it is exhilarating and challenging but so much fun, and these developers truly deserve our support, especially with how rotten the video game industry has become nowadays."
228,Jeronimo1776,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"A must play for all DOOM fans, and FPS enthusiasts! I have played Doom 64, and Doom 2016. This is by far the BEST. It has more to do than most DOOM ""purists"" may like. It has puzzles in between fights which slows the pacing down (didn't Doom 2016 also have puzzles too? If i remember correctly there were some puzzles in 2016), and the fact that you use the chainsaw for ammo, the punches for health, and a flame ability for armor, creates a very deep and rewarding experience (easy to play/hard to master). Sure, you may have to slow down and THINK a little about your next move, but it allows the game to be very rich and rewarding as you adjust and get better. The multiplayer (Battlemode) is addicting and fun, and more replayable than it already is. I just highly recommend beating/getting good at the campaign before jumping in. It can be intense with all of the currently quarantined pros online. Also, where is the horde mode? Please give us a horde mode!"
229,UkaAku,"Mar 31, 2020",10,"Dont listen to people here that write bad reviews, this is a good sp game , the current gaming generation of gamers are **** up people that only care about battle royale games. Media/ youtube/ twitch streamers always are toxic when it comes to new games, The devs worked hard on this game and its perfect, the people that complain always about every new game coming out are losers and dont know how to live with themself. Please ignore those guys and make up ur own mind about a game. Shame on this current generation of gamers."

Да,там есть головоломки что по идеи не вписывается в такой жанр,но это лишь передышка перед другим боем в котором ты получишь только лишь наслаждание.  Да,головоломки и паркур порой напоминают марио как в уровне когда ты встречаешь впервые ""ревенанта"" что тупо,но вы заходите в дум чтобы увидеть логику и реализм? Насчёт радужности и казуала,на первых уровнях я заметил что пила парит,не то что в прошлой части там где ты достаёшь ту же пилу из трупа,но когда я начал проходить дальше,мне было как то пофиг на такие изменения,я наслаждался убийством демонов и мне было наср*ть на то откуда я это оружие взял. Насчёт геймлея,его ускорили,и что в этом плохого? Лично мне нравится новый геймплей ведь добавили фишки которых не хватало в ""Doom 2016"" по типу криогранат что дало новые возможности,а если улучшить то незаменимая вещь.

232,KekZ,"Apr  3, 2020",10,So i played the game for around 100 hours now. and i can say its the best game i played for a long time. It makes everything better than 2016. The combat feels amazing with the new movement options. The story is absolutely amazing and the gunplay is even better. I dont know how people can give this game less then 10 points o.0
233,LoletinAlexis,"Apr  4, 2020",9,"DOOM Eternal is what should have been the DOOM of 2016. *STORY*: DOOM Slayer returns to take revenge on the forces of hell and save the Earth. You can see ID Software's efforts to give Eternal a better and more interesting script, but it's just not its point.Nevertheless, there are some quite well achieved references that resolve doubts regarding the classic DOOMs. *GAMEPLAY*: Eternal has the best FPS gunplay of the eighth generation of video games, with plenty of playable elements and lots of fun.On the contrary, although the platform areas are better achieved than in the previous one, there is still a necessary improvement. *GRAPHICS*: The engine is a visual and technical marvel and artistically magnificent. *SOUND*: The soundtrack fits perfectly and the sound effects are well achieved. *INNOVATION: Eternal DOOM doesn't innovate like DOOM (2016), but it doesn't have to. New playable elements, new races, new plot... This is the real return of the DOOM Slayer."
234,R_1777,"Apr  9, 2020",9,"Supera en prácticamente todo a su entrega anterior.id software nos prometió mas enemigos, mas feroces e implacables... y lo cumplieron con creces. Mejoraron la jugabilidad agregando la habilidad de ""Carrera"" o dash como todos le dicen, lo que hace que podamos esquivar ataques mas feroces y salir de aprietos pero sin romper el juego... y si que es útil, los enemigos son tan c4brones que un Caballero del infierno o un Pinky del juego anterior no son nada comparados con estos. Los enemigos al ser mas jodidos que antes, entonces ya cuentan con la mecánica de los puntos débiles, los cuales es obligatorio saber utilizar si o si, por que aparecen tantos enemigos que si no los ocupamos y no nos aprovechamos de esos puntos débiles entonces nos aplastaran sin problemas. En este caso el juego nos fuerza a utilizar todo nuestro arsenal, no es terminarse la munición de un arma y cambiarla por otra, hay que utilizar todas.La cantidad de munición a siro reducida a mas o menos un 40 por ciento en comparación del juego anterior. Digo, la escopeta pasó de tener 60 cartuchos a 24 como máximo. Eso hace que tengamos que utilizar la motosierra mas a menudo y no hay que mortificarse al utilizarla ya que aun que nos acabemos la gasolina el primer uso siempre se recarga con el tiempo. Agregaron granadas normales y granadas congelantes, sumado de un lanzallamas que nos sirve para conseguir armadura. Y a la superescopeta le agregaron un gancho que nos sirve para aventarnos hacia los enemigos.Eliminaron la clásica pistola y he visto reseñas en los que se quejan de eso, pero siendo realistas ¿cuando la han ocupado en el juego anterior? Su uso era muy puntero y se limitaba a el principio del juego ya que en niveles avanzados no servía de nada, y en este caso me alegro de que la retiraran, ya que si no lo ocupábamos en el juego anterior y siendo que en este caso los enemigos son mas difíciles y rápidos ¿Serviría de algo realmente? Algo que si considero negativo es que ahora el cuerpo a cuerpo ya no puede debilitar enemigos con el, por que ahora hasta un simple zombi o poseído soporta todos los golpes que les des, pero al menos los aturde un poco.... eso y que hay zonas donde hay una especie de líquido morado que nos limita el movimiento, nos movemos muy lento, y ni si quiera podemos saltar, mientras que todos los enemigos se pueden mover con total libertad. - En cuanto a sonido. El soundtrack es espectacular, transmite lo que necesita y es frenético sin llegar a cansar.Los sonidos en general están bien, pero hay unos detallitos que no me gustaron, como por ejemplo: el sonido de disparo de la ametralladora pesada, se escucha como simples clicks y no transmiten fuerza como en el juego anterior y que los gemidos de dolor del Slayer apenas se escuchan, por lo que pasan desapercibidos (a menos que hayamos activado los sonidos clásicos, pero rompen con la inmersión y la estética del juego). La interfás en los menús no me gustó del todo, ya que es muy agresiva y demasiado lleno de detalles sumados con una fuente para el texto algo cuadrado... a ""O"" parece un rombo :/ aunque en los textos largo al menos utilizan otra fuente. En cuanto al HUD... se ve bien pero como las cosas vitales son tan pequeñas al final no las vemos para nada cuando la cosa se pone fea y mucho menos las escuchamos cuando recargan, ya que tanto ruido durante el combate hace que simplemente no se escuchen y para acabarla de amolar, casi no se ve la carga de las granadas o del lanzallamas ya que los iconos se ven muy traslucidos, y al no poder verlos entonces utilizarlos es casi una apuesta. Otro punto a destacar es la introducción de los niveles maestros, los cuales son los mismos del juego pero desde el principio te encuentras a enemigos bastante duros... te aparecen 2 tiranos apenas empezando los niveles.A pesar de que los niveles maestros son muy buenos, todavía hecho de menos el modo ""Arcade"" Lo único que detesto del juego es que si tenemos internet inestable y si se pierde la conexión con Bethesda.net entonces el juego se pausa y nos pone un letrerote en nuestra cara y odio que interrumpan la acción de una manera tan invasiva. O que tarda una eternidad en cargar los niveles si le cuesta conectarse a los servidores.De a perdis lo hubieran hecho como en Borderlands 2, el cual te ponía un letrero a una esquina de la pantalla y no pausaba la acción para nada. P.D. No mencione nada del modo Battlemode ya que al parecer está mas muerto que el multijugador del juego anterior ya que nunca encuentro partida, así que no lo he podido probar :/ Y si en un futuro se les ocurriera agregar algún multijugador pues preferiría que intenten imitar un Quake."
235,jacob4,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"An absolute mind blowing hell of a ride and return to the Doom franchise! Doom Eternal is basically more of Doom 2016 but bigger, better, and crazier!  This game has intense fast paced combat, incredible level design filled with awesome secrets, more interesting enemies, and more of the awesome Doom lore unfolding as you play! The delay is sure did payoff! So much amazing content plus more in one epic sequel! This game is indeed this generation's version of Doom II Hell On Earth!"

237,Symphoniax,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"This game is one of the best fps of the last years. The shooting feels good and it's fast, at higher difficulties becomes really challenging and requires you to think and manage your resources. The story is good and not overly complicated.I would have given a 10 if not for the marauders that ruin the pacing of the game."
238,DAz_dingoose,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Greatest shooter of the decade, maybe even greatest game of the decade. All the negative reviews must have came from people with brain damage, its the only logical conclusion."
239,rendanggorengz,"Mar 27, 2020",8,"Tbh i would give it 9/10,but it had a slight problem with that Bethesda Account which i need to waste my time signing up in the Bethesda account.I tried it on ultra violence.And to be fair,the opening of this game was amazing.It's really cool with that rock music that brings up what Doom really is.And in the game,just like Doom 2016,i had to fight an easy enemy with my shotgun.I think it's an improvement using shotgun instead of regular pistol like in Doom 2016.I feel like using shotgun is more paced than using regular pistol.That was an amazing opening experience.For the game,i feel like it's more fast paced because you can do many skills like double jump or dashing.It makes the game feel different from Doom 2016 but it's still a Doom formula.And it makes easier to jump over the enemies and shoot em up while jumping.With some obstacles that makes the game fun.And thank you Bethesda for not making a puzzle in this game,because obstacles are fun enough and paced than puzzle.There are different variety of enemies that can be found in the progress of the game.I also hate many enemies like arachnotron with the turret and i know Bethesda made that enemy from long ago to make people hate it.I hate when i want to shoot the turret,but instead i  shoot the body/face because my aim sucks.And i died many times because of Arachnotron.And it makes me depressed also it's challenging and it feels really good when u hit the turret and killed it.An enjoyable experience from it.For the graphics,it's kinda Cartoonish which kinda disappointing.Just like that face from a guy that has a similar face to Thanos,but the skinny version.For the world design,it's really good and it's an improvement from Doom 2016.For the sound,it's kinda similar to Doom 2016,and i prefer Doom 2016 enemy and gun deisgn because it feels more natural and more bloody than the Doom Eternal.I would give this 9/10 but i had some troubles like bethesda account and more.Conclusion,Doom Eternal is a great game with more fast-paced gameplay than before,but maybe Bethesda should give a little bit more.Overall 8/10"
240,RamenNoodle,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"Pretty much Doom 2016 with more mechanics, more gore, and more demons. Now, if you haven't played Doom 2016 prior to this game, do that first ($20 on Steam and they have really nice sales) as you would not be able to return to 2016 once you've picked up Doom Eternal. Systems like the new gib system are extremely satisfying, you can watch as pieces of the demons you are mowing down scatter in a fountain of blood. The addition of the blade on the Doomguy's arm spices up some of the glory kills with even more blood. The new weapon mods are pretty much the same as the ones in 2016, except the useless mods were all switched out for more interesting ones. Progression comes in weapons with weapon mods and mod upgrades then masteries. Additionally, your sult can be upgraded with praetor tokens and some kind of shard (I forget the name).Now, Eternal has many design decisions that clearly separates it from its predecessor. Eternal has a generally less gritty and dark theme compared to 2016 and has much more in bright ammo or health pickups. There is a decent amount of platforming though you do this knowing that any moment, you will enter a new arena in which another epic massacre of demons will ensue. Finally, the addition of mechanics such as the blood punch, flame belch, and new grenades serve as a way for the player to manage their resources.Thus far, I have but one complaint for the game which is the challenges. As a bit of a completionist, the challenges requiring me to glory kill from specific angles on demons which only appear once or twice kind of sucks. This is not really a reason to not buy the game though. The game is good. You should play it."
241,SunLynx,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"Doom Eternal give you what you expect in an action FPS. Hell, in an FPS. If you want a fast paced shooter where you massacre stuff with high mobility this is what you need. Just point and shoot, with very few cut-scenes and dialog."
242,Ziege132,"Mar 30, 2020",10,The game isn't what I expexted it is far better then anything I expected It always keeps fresh because the devs add masterlevels wich are remakes of the the levels you played in the game but always with a harder difficulty level. The story is also in th right amount it is the right amount so that it won't disturb you
243,BassStorm,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"The game is fantastic. Doom guy's face is kinda revealed, we got more story that got me interested in the game, the gameplay is just ETERNAL. The only thing I didn't like was the weapon pickups. In Doom (2016) they had a place, you picked the weapons from dead soldiers or other places but here most of the weapons are like an old game. Don't get me wrong I like it but it feels a little out of place in my opinion. This game is just Awesome!Haven't finished it, I played only 9 hours and those hours I really enjoyed.For the dev team and the game testers out there THANK YOU for a polished product!"
244,IGN-MiddleEast,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Why 7.7?

245,Thebltzkrieg1,"Mar 31, 2020",10,It takes everything good in the last game and improves it to make an even better experience . The new armor chainsaw and health systems are great .

247,OpDelta,"Apr  1, 2020",9,"Don't listen to these entitled pubescent Bethesda troll haters in the reviews! This game is a masterpiece! And in my opinion, if not better than Doom 2016. The combat is defined and fast paced, enemy AI are relentless (a lot smarter than 2016), graphics are amazing and well optimized and the story is decent (hence why I gave it a 9 instead of 10). For those who said in their review that this game is slow paced, you're on crack cocaine or imagined you were playing Minecraft! This game is brutally fast and challenging (played on Nightmare)! The adding of the dash into game opened up a whole dimension of the game that Doom 2016 didn't have. Like holy **** You can dash half way across a map, shot a grenade into a Cacodemons mouth while in mid air, perform an execution on it mid air spraying blood and guts everywhere and then dash back without touching the ground while 40 different demons are trying to snipe you out of the air! So visceral and exciting! Sure there are some quite times in-between killing demons and finding secrets, but that will happen when you destroy ever single entity in site!! The area will be death with silence (I digress)! And just like Doom 2016, the head banging thrashing industrial metal composed by Mick Gordon tides with the Doom slaying carnage just as well as the prequel. I'm telling you guys if you're into fps, carnage, a challenge with a great soundtrack and graphics, pick up this game. An instant classic! ( P.S. the multiplayer is decent as well)"

249,Trollivasara,"Apr  1, 2020",9,"Great game. Yes, it is different than Doom (2016), it has more survival and lots more fast-paced gameplay. There's sort of rthythm in killing, doing glory-kills and chainsawing thrash mobs to gain ammo and health. I finished the game at ultra-violence, it was fun. I think all the boss fights were pretty easy. Only thing i didn't like was those marauders and their dogs... But i killed them too. Arm blade to the face!"
250,Dasamurai34,"Jun 23, 2020",9,"A great step ahead from doom 2016. This game is really, really good. The gunplay is perfected from 2016 along with the Level Design. The Story isn't too great, but for a doom nerd, it's okay (me, Its a doom game, you don't really need a good story TBH) Again, it seems they really took it to the next level coming from doom 2016. Also, new demons bring a fresh experience to this game. Some complaints, however: limited ammo, a certain annoying enemy (Marauder), and no snap map. If you love FPS/DOOM games, get this game. If you want to get into those games, play this. It's not too difficult. To conclude this review: everything you really need for a good doom game (Level design, demons, guns/gunplay) are here, and better than ever."
251,AMilkshake,"Apr  1, 2020",9,"Not as well rounded and polished as DOOM 2016 but still exhilarating fast paced action that keeps you reaching for any and every edge you can get if you play it at an appropriate difficulty. There is slightly more storyline than the previous game, but it only serves to hype up your next encounter. I believe the skill ceiling is higher and they challenge you more in this game, however at some points combat is somewhat over-complicated in enemy variety. You need to use certain weapons/abilities to defeat certain enemies, however so many enemies can be thrown at you sometimes that they block shots for eachother and all you can do is run and use explosives. Multiplayer got hammered in DOOM 2016 but it was actually fun. The multiplayer in this one isn't interesting and isn't good enough to keep people playing."

254,awesomewyguy,"Apr  3, 2020",10,"Absolute masterpiece. Please ignore every other review on the user section, they're all bad and wrong. If you are a player who likes to rip and tear until it is done, you will absolutely love doom eternal. This game is amazing, adding new elements that doom 2016 never could even muster to offer at the time.If you hated this game just because ammo was scarce, use your chainsaw more. If you hated this game because of the ""Jumping Puzzles"" you literally are incapable of using your brain to see a jump that you are provided with a double jump and 2 dashes to complete. If you hated this game because of the secrets, you don't have to get all of them, most are optional. You thought this game was too hard? This game is built off of resource management, you gotta learn how to do that. If you haven't played this game, start reading from here. The game's bones are resource management and fighting. If you would like the standard doom eternal experience without going crazy over that one collectible, just don't get it at that moment and wait until you have exploration upgrades to find it or fast travel. The levels are gorgeous. Like literally, look out your window or go outside to a big suburban town, then come back inside and play more doom eternal. Tell me that you aren't asking ""How the heck did earth get this way?"" Anyway, the visuals are amazing. The specs are really living up to what they said they were. Multiplayer... is a disappointment. The battlemode in this game is the only bad point I have. They didn't fully flesh it out/make it fun, which is why most people stick to the campaign, the best thing in the game. One more bad point that I think more people should be aware of: not exactly bad but just a bug. If you have cheat codes equipped while doing a campaign mission you've never done before that has a slayer gate, disable all cheat codes and the slayer key will appear. This bug has hindered me many times, but literally everything else in the game makes up for it."
255,Danthenormalguy,"Apr  5, 2020",10,"This game deserves to be played, it fixes all the issues the 2016 Doom has, buffed weapons, gameplay, story, and so much more. You will enjoy every minute of this game from start to finish. But do make sure you have a strong enough CPU to handle this game."
256,HirschbergT,"Apr  5, 2020",9,"I've never taken the time to review any game before, but I felt that this game is worth the time to share my opinion. Let's first start with the not-so-good aspects.-The platforming can be frustrating at times and seems like a big departure from other Doom games and more appropriate for a different game type.-Weapon pickups are not nearly as immersive as Doom 2016. Overall things are far more arcade-like, which will be a turn off to some.-Another bummer is that the game currently has only one multiplayer mode. Here's to hoping id software will listen to fans and bring back at least DM and TDM.-While I appreciate id's efforts to make the game more engaging by adding more mechanics, it can get a little overwhelming at times, but it isn't a big deal considering the game's combat is superb. Now on to the good.+The combat is, in my opinion, very addictive and will really get your heart rate going, especially at the higher difficulties. Quite frankly, this is some of the best FPS action I have experienced since Half Life 2.+The game is insanely well optimized and looks great at 1440p.+The enhanced traversal mechanics add a nice extra layer to the combat loop.+There is a nice variety of enemies, each requiring a unique approach within the combat loop.+The level design is interesting and a nice upgrade from Doom 2016's comparatively cramped levels. While it is not perfect, the excellent combat encounters and presentation more than make up for the game's minor gripes. If you enjoyed Doom 2016's fast paced`game play and are open to Eternal's additions ahead of time, I think you won't be disappointed."
257,amii_,"Apr  6, 2020",9,"Doom 2016 was my favorite shooter and one of my favorite game of the 2010s its slick and fast pace gameplay was amazing and incredibly fun, but now with the release of Doom Eternal it takes everything Doom 2016 did right and made it a lot better. To start off the level design on this game is horrific (in a good way) on a visual storytelling point, everything looks amazing to look at and it catches the esscence of doom beautifully, the levels offer a lot of mobility to the player and makes the level design look more 3 dimentional they are fun and great. The platorming is a little bit of a double edge sword its so fun just going around swinging through poles jumping and climbing walls (the design of these are beautiful), but sometimes it gets a bit tedidous and repetitive it doesnt feel bad most of the time. The gameplay is **** amazing the introduction of dashes and jumps just make the game so interactive and they give a lot of mobility to the player that fit like a puzzle piece with the amazing level design the options that you have just make the experience a lot better with the chainsaw and the weapon mods overall the gameplay feels like a more free version of 2016 with a bit lighter but brutal tone. The soundtrack is really good not the most amazing but really good overall. The ripping and tearing along with the level design and the fun packex in here, Doom Eternal is a great videogame and an eternal doom experience. Like a wise melon once said: ""Im feeling a strong to a decent 9 on this one"" (i also love the collectibles they are so fun to collect)"
258,TOXICLATINO,"Apr  7, 2020",10,"This games delivers what all games should , EMOTIONS, it makes your heart pump and the fear sensation of dying and going all the way back to the mission and sometimes the long checkpoints it makes every single decision to be decisive.  If you're familiar with DOOM 2016 and you know that you can't blink your eyes you will feel familiar with this.  I see some people complaining about being too difficult. These people aren't gamers.  All they want is a game where you can save after every bullet you shoot.  There's no emotion on this. There's no point on playing a game just for the looks and with no sense of DANGER AND EXPECTATION.  To this people, go  back to your GOD MODE STATUS QUO games where you die in game and respawn pretty much on the same spot with no consequences."

Nobody holds your hand, DOOM ETERNAL expects your best from you and I love that fact. I'm getting tired of games playing themselves (uncharted for example). NO! You need to jump right, avoid attacks right and shoot right or you won't go much further... It is from now a king of Shooters. And about all that people that cry about the fact that there is no AMMO... there is you idiots! Game wants you to manage your resources, while jumping, shooting and avoiding enemies.

263,Lemartes,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"It's good.Compared to DOOM 2016 it is much more visually interesting, has been injected with more ""STORY,"" customization, depth of complexity, and love.If you thought 2016's combat was perfect this may not be for you.This appears to be where most negative reviews creep in (along side people who are having technical problems).Where 2016 was all about mobility and freedom to engage how you like, Eternal has refined systems that could easily fall unused from 2016 (the chainsaw, equipment usage, and additional movement systems) and made them core elements that you will be using almost every fight.Unlike 2016, you will be running out of ammo and need to chainsaw a trash mob to get back in the fight, and because fights can have MANY more enemies fighting you at once with faster traveling projectiles you are much more likely to be hit, encouraging you to glory kill almost wherever possible. Larger enemies are much more of a threat and will take considerable focus to bring down, but also have additional weak spots that in many cases can be removed to limit their options or reduce their effectiveness. In summary, combat has been given more layers of depth, but with less options to approach it. I can understand there are quite a few players who this will only cause frustration to, and make it feel like an inferior sequel, but when it clicks I firmly believe it is a strict improvement on its predecessor."

266,TFuran,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"Short review: Doom Eternal is better than Doom 2016, but ID needs a third Doom game to reach a golden mean. Long review: Doom Eternal came to me as a surprise on many fronts, even after an extensive advertisement campaign and fanbase hype. Story continuation, drastic gameplay and verticality changes, unconventional multiplayer, countless easter-eggs and customisation options. It was certainly not the classical Doom or Quake game a devoted player became accommodated with, similar to Warcraft becoming a flashy MOBA game, but the question of whether the change was alien and uncalled for is quite challenging to answer. First, the story itself. Having completed the campaign several times and analysed all of codex entries, the key word I would apply to the storytelling is ""deus ex machina"". Doomguy, previously a frenzied character who just kills demons, suddenly became an omnipotent god-like hero and nemesis for 3 different races apart from humanity. Very limited, flashback-oriented backstory as to how he came to be, why did everything happen on Argenta, was it because of him, why was he granted the blessing of Divinity machine, and so on, and so forth. ID might have pushed a bit too hard into a new territory this time, resulting in more question than answers and implying that a new game will tell the player more about the whole Hell, Earth and Heaven (not Urdak) ordeal. But the setting itself had laid a solid foundation for next instalments of the franchise, leaving obvious gaps and suggestions as to what to await next. We will wait and see how the story, yet unfinished and still vague, unfolds itself. Secondly, the multiplayer. There might not be much to say here. It is fun and engaging, not necessarily fresh in terms of the theme, but most definitely better than classical and mind-numbing deathmatch we grew sick of for the past several decades. I was satisfied with it during Quake arenas already. Progression and customisation however leave very little room for replayability of Doom multiplayer, when the only thing keeping you at the game is a new cosmetic item or an avatar icon. I would love to see more unconventional gamemodes introduced to the setting, featuring a sound progression and reasonable loadout customisation, as strategy brings longer lasting fun than one-dimensional arcade. And finally, the gameplay. Oh boy, where should I start. Long story short, it is excessive in everything. Movement, upgrades, puzzles, sprites, events, armaments, even a whole player hub with easter-eggs and collectibles. For a Doom universe, and for the grim and silent character of Doomguy, it might be too much of unnecessary details interfering with the life-long mission of punching demons in the face. On the one hand, it brings character to the game, a comment many might have said in their reviews, on the other hand however it feels too alien to be introduced to a player in such volume. The game feels like an experimental sandbox aimed to identify and reimagine the icon of Doom, too ambitious for its own good, too fast paced, too completionist-oriented, too naive with its puzzles, too desperate throwing players into arena pits to uncover new mechanics and combos one would not bother considering in a less stressful scenario. It is a step in the right direction, for sure. But as I have already stated, we need a third game to nail the tempo, right inbetween two extremes: Between arcade and ambient grimdark, a child of Doom and Quake, the earlier Doom and Quake. Or if you like, a mature and self-confident version of Doom 2016. I would still like to give the game a score of 8/10. I might be a Doom fanboy after all, but the game is still solid, even with its flaws. Everything works seamless, even if hectic, and the atmosphere is all I could wish for. Doom Eternal feels like an early-twenties metalhead who likes to experiment with his habits, but if he decides on his life mission just right and applies enough pressure and work to become his very best, then something magical will certainly happen."

268,Zaebumba,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"High speed at the pace of Mick Gordon's music, Doom Eternal definitely came out successful!!!"
269,Sauron1,"Mar 24, 2020",10,"This game is a truly arena fps masterpiece,It's everything a Doom fan could have asked for,it's frenetic and challenging,colorful and diverse.It beats the previous goat Doom 2016 in every single aspect,level design,difficulty,demon design,bosses,longevity,replayability,better multiplayer mode and most of all,the game has a **** of new features.Heck,even the HUD is way better.Regarding the graphics part,well it's ages better then the previous game and that's thanks to the new IDTech7 which makes geometry detail wonders especially on pc. The game is the most optimized pc title at the very moment and it runs smooth as hell on every pc,PC MASTER RACE baby.Furthermore the game could be compared to a Soul-like game in terms of difficulty when that is set to Ultra Violence or Nightmare level,and that makes the game even funnier with Mick Gordon's soundtrack that basically tells you 24/7 to rip and tear until the end.Doom Eternal is my goty 2020 for the very moment,waiting for Cyberpunk 2077 to challenge it.Furthermore I have a comment on the negative reviews on this site and regarding this game,don't even bother reading those who gave this game a straight 0,people that give such a low mark to such a game are either retarded or fortnite snowflakes who know nothing about arena fps games and what they are supposed to be like.Give a try to the game and play it more than 10 hours and you will get to see that all the negative reviews here are pointless pile of complacent trash.This is all for now,rip and tear brothers and sisters,rip and tear until it's done.Thanks ID Software for this masterpiece of a game,the best fps we Doom fans could have ever asked for."
270,elshogoso,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"If you only played Doom 2016 and never played the original Doom games, you may not understand why the game took the art direction it took. It is more colorful and more cartoony... Just like the original Doom was. Doom was always a violent and gorey game, but in it's origins, it wasn't a dark game. It had very colorful and bright aesthetics, which took full advantage of the VGA graphics of the time. Doom Eternal pays tribute to that aesthetic, and honestly, it all around seems to be targeted at pleasing the fans of classic doom. The extremely arcadey gameplay is strong evidence of that, that is Doom and Quake in a nutshell. Extremely high mobility, labirinthic level design, violence and brutal difficulty. Doom Eternal checks all those marks for me. On the higher difficulty levels, the game is merciless. It is a power fantasy, but you are only rewarded with the satisfaction of that power fantasy when you understand and master all the mechanics and movement of the game. Many people seem to be turned off by the jumping. While it isn't technical and precise like I would like it to be (Quake-style strafe jumping is more my alley when it comes to fast movement), I don't think the platforming elements are nearly as bad as people are making them out to be. It's not difficult, once you get the hang of it, it becomes really enjoyable too. Overall, I had many criticisms about Doom 2016 as a sequel to Doom 1, 2 and 64, and most of them were addressed by Doom Eternal. It is a true tribute to Classic Doom fans and I appreciate that."

272,keviniscool,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"A damn fun, face paced, unforgiving brutal game, Doom Eternal only has one goal: be a fun shooter, with focus one not much else.If something doesnt serve to make the gameplay more fun, you wont find it in this game. While that may be a detriment if you're the type too read into environments or lore books (both of which i found a bit lacking) But it more than makes up for that with the action. Otherwise I found the game a bit buggy, i had to reset too a past checkpoint about three times because an event wouldnt occur like a wall breaking, and theres also this one Boss enemy that goes against the design policy of unrestricted moment, without spoiling much, you have to stay at medium range of them AND wait for them to attack so you may counter, while not difficult, hes very tedious, and i groaned every time he showed up"
273,SolidSnakeMG2,"Mar 24, 2020",10,Amazing game with very in depth combat. It is definitely a skill based game so casual shooter players beware!

275,WateryMind,"Mar 25, 2020",9,"TL;DR: The Doom 2 to 2016's Doom 1. Harder, faster, more technical with a greater focus on weapon switching, equipment usage and mobility. Doom Eternal is an amazing, breakneck fast, punishing example of what id Software, and the FPS genre in general, is capable of. It is a game that sets the pace of combat, and expects you to keep up and doesn't give a damn if you can't, and apparently people have an issue with this. As a whole across my entire Ultraviolence playthrough, there were maybe 5 encounters that I would consider questionable in terms of difficulty, and 2 of those were optional. The combat is different to 2016, with a greater focus on equipment usage and movement compared to the previous game, with enemies that require more strategy and thought then ""Apply Gauss Cannon/SSG until dead"" and arenas that, near the end of the campaign, become outright dangerous. The story felt very Doom, taking itself just seriously enough whilst also acknowledging just how silly it all is, and the soundtrack is... Well, 2016's OST was not a one-off smash hit for Mick Gordon. This is not a game for everyone, and a lot of Doom 2016 fans are going to be disappointed it isn't 2016-2. It is a very different beast, but in the best way. In a way, it's the perfect homage to Doom 2, in that it takes the formula of the previous title, and does its own thing with it. Marauders can eat it tho."

277,mokey,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"i’m going to start this off by keeping it plain and simple. THE GAME IS GOOD. BUY IT. i’ve been anticipating this game since release. while there was a delay, i knew it would be worth it. id software has created a phenomenal game that will undoubtedly rule my top games of 2020. the first hour of doom eternal required some getting used to even after playing countless hours of doom 2016. all of the abilities, mechanics, and weapons became overwhelming for me in the beginning. i felt so overwhelmed with all the new features in the game that i was kinda disappointed at first, but as soon as i figured out how the game works, i could NOT stop playing. the game feels AMAZING. the fluidity of all the weapons and abilities in ur arsenal in use during every fight is sooo satisfying. the new demons provide a new challenge, and keep the game refreshing despite how repetitive moving around an area and shooting demons sounds on paper. the level design is SOLID. packed with hidden secrets, collectibles, and colorful, dynamic environments that lead me to taking breaks nearly every level to just sit and observe the world around me. the game is loaded with some insane boss fights that feel like what should be in a hack n slash game like god of war, but somehow it was put in a fps, and somehow it works, and it works wayyy better than i would ever imagine it to be..."
278,iNeat,"Mar 25, 2020",8,"В целом DOOM Eternal является мощным шутером, который держит серию в калибре культовой. Но при всем множестве геймплейных фишек, ядро игры остается довольно примитивным и олдскульным. Для кого-то это плюс, но для кого-то минус."

283,pulcinopiofb,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"I'm just here to leave a 10/10 to this game. Actual vote is between 8.5-9.5 .The game is great. It may not be as frenetic as Doom2016 (debetable) but it's still 10 times more action-packed than all other fps's on the market. Soundtrack is amazing. the levels are linear but work. The new 'weak spot' system is a bit of a necessity to exploit in the first levels of the game, but it gets more of a choice once you obtain a good arsenal and definetely adds depth to the gameplay.People leaving 0, 1, 2 or 3 to a game like this because they need to chainsaw a couple demons every fight are truly a joke. If you wanted to give the game a try but the 7.6 user score scares you *please*, but it."
284,SoBasicallyBruh,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"This game is amazing. I love everything about it. The Combat , The Platforming and most importantly , the damn soundtrack. This game is a masterpiece. And for the people that are complaining and giving the game 0's and such. They all suck , because they apparently are disabled and can't do some easy platforming. BUT , the story starts too suddenly. I wish there was a LITTLE bit more explaining. But , overall , good game."
285,Embraxe,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"I love how id stuck true to the classic look.. definitely brings me back to the old doom.. and to the people who think all the parkour and lower res enemy texture are bad.m its because ID is aiming for a more arcade type of game rather than an immersive experience, just like the old gamesthe enemy models are lowered because they'renow destructible and they have to make a good design for each part of the demon, and i think giving it better textures is a lot more work"
286,lordkuro04,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"A sequel to Doom 2016 that accurately captures the essence of the franchise.  Excellent gameplay , extravagant and lush visuals.  And an even better soundtrack than the last game.Fast and relentless. One of the best single player shooters ever made. And this time around , the difficulty is better balanced so Ultra nightmare or nightmare runs are much more doable as well"
287,Daggerknight,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"One of the best FPS games to come along in years. Playing this game is like re-living the thrill of shooters in the 90's and early 2000's. It's like a mix of classic Doom and Quake 2, albeit with far more movement options, and SPEED. Holy cow, this game is fast, and brutal. Unlike the 2016 game, levels are designed to feel  a lot more organic, and less explicitly broken down into arena lock down's. They are still  a thing, but they don't feel as obvious. They are also, harder, but not unfairly so. While enemies pack a bigger punch, they also react much more to being hit. The difficulty also eases up as you play, particularly as you upgrade your suit and guns. Once you've unlocked the full toy box  and have the full movement and weapon range, everything just clicks. Battles are intense, exhilarating, and keep you firmly in the moment like so very few shooters do. The aesthetic of the game is about as perfect a modernization of classic Doom as it gets. Enemies are visually familiar, but with far more attitude than in 2016. The environments, likewise, are jaw dropping, presenting epic and varied vista's. This is Hell on Earth as it was always meant to be. An interesting thing about the environments is that they are a large part of the reason why the game feels so much like a 90's shooter. Despite the movement mechanics being so advanced, the flow and visual design of each section captured the spirit of those older titles almost perfectly. And then there's the sound track, which is far more riff based than the 2016 ""glitch rock"" focused score. Add the OST in with the visuals, and this is quite emphatically the most ""Metal"" game around. My only real issues with the game come down to some levels having an over reliance on platforming segments, and one particular enemy type. I won't spoil who, but I'll say that he's far too contrary to the rest of the games mechanics for my taste. Some people have had difficulty juggling the games multiple systems (Fire for armor, chainsaw for ammo, glory kill for health), but again, I personally thought they flowed exceptionally well together once your abilities were all in line. This means that the early half of the game may be a bit of a rough edge for some, though I wasn't personally put off by it. It's well worth persevering through though, even if you feel like it's initially a lot to take in. My excitement is based on the single player here. I have yet to try out the game's Battle Mode, but honestly; it's worth the buy just for the campaign alone. It's one of the easiest games to recommend, especially if you're an old FPS fan."
288,Xtruper,"Mar 27, 2020",10,"The game is very good! It has cool fights with many enemies and for all enemies you need another tactic. There are many good action and not so easy campaign. I think it's one of better chapter of Doom, but it's only my opinion. Sory for my not ideal English."
289,LabRAT20,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Alright, going to be honest, I had never played a Doom game before this one, so while I might not be as emotionally invested in the series as others who have played the others in their youth, I can definitely say that this game got me so obsessed with the series as a whole that I went and got all the others, just to continue the experience. I had assumed there wasn't any story and just came in with the expectation of shoot, kill, repeat, and while yes that is a lot of it and it's damn fun, I ended up becoming invested and curious about the story of everything, naturally, had to go play and watch for more information. That being said, fantastic level design, gameplay, and to be honest, I actually love the added colours, while some say it takes away from the brutal experience (compared to 2016), I think it only highlights it, gives each atmosphere a bit more character, makes it so much more pleasing on the eye, and makes me want to just stare at every new thing I came across because of how beautiful it is. Not sure what else to say so, I love the painting with Daisy on the wall, it is adorable"
290,Totidoki,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"First I want to make an awnser to negative reviews. While some have constructive criticism, i cannot understand other arguments that I will list: -Doom eternal is too cartoony, so it isn't doom what? Have you ever played doom and doom 2? Doom at its core is a fps in a cartoony gore setting with over the top guns, demons, and story. It's centered primarly arround gameplay and the more cartoonish (if you can call it that way, boy do not play nintendo games if you think that is cartoony) art direction makes for way clearer level design and arenas, which so many shooters fail at today. If this is bad then enjoy your visually bloated realistic game where you have trouble seeing an ennemy cause it blends with the props. To me, the only people who think doom eternals visuals are a betrayal to doom are the people who only played doom 3 and doom 2016, which are great in their own way but do not feel like OG doom and more like their own take on the series. If you prefer this take, cool but don't you dare saying that doom, at its core is a serious, mysterious and sometimes scary shooter. play dead space if you want especialy that. -Then some people complained about always being low on ammo and getting blocked in the map. my advice: get good. No seriously, the game has a steep learning curve in the first 5 hours, but once you get and master all your weapons, upgrade your ammo stock and learn how to master this game's movement and flow, then it becomes the best fps ever made. It's on the game's fault though if it doesn't let you experience that before the 4th level but boy it is rewarding, give it some time. After beating the game on ultraviolence, i can say i was never killed in a cheap way, never ran out of options and was always invested in the combat. Okay that out of the window, I can confidently say it's my favourite fps of all time, 30 hours in. I played a lot of fps, hell we installed unreal and quake on the highschool computers so we could make lans, i played all the half life, red faction, call of duty, star wars dark forces, all the doom games so i have something to compare. That's why this game felt so good for me, it managed to bring back passion and novelty in a genre that died 10 years ago.  It made me feel so powerfull yet always on the brink of getting owned, game me many options that force you to always change weapons, re evaluate your strategy, prioritize ennemies and manage your ammo, it's the same feeling as in doom 1 and 2, but on steroids.The story, as always is over the top and all cutscenes (i think there is less than 40 minutes of cutscenes in the game, all are skippable and sparse in the last thrid of the game) feel right in the doom mindset, some are hype, some expose you to some lore or some are just there to make the levels breathe, often near a boss or a big fight. The lore is totally skippable to but is surprisingly deep and well written, too bad it is not as well included in the levels as doom 2016. Thouh the levels are more focused on secret finding and exploration, some being more open ended which is a great breath of fresh air and more akin to the first doom games' level design. The levels are also filled with main encounters and smaller ones which also makes the level's flow constant while doom 2016 was more: big adrenaline surge where you find demons and then boring coridors with exposition via dialogue. Overall, the level design feels more confident and know what it wants while the last game kinda didn't know where to sit. I can't run out of good things to say about this game, but i can run out of bad things to say about it: first, i would have preffered having all the weapons more quickly. second, The marauder is a hot pile of garbade and i hate this **** he plays devil may cry and wants you to play his game, except you are playing doom. Third: hopefully i didn't watch any trailers or marketing **** on the game, because seeing those after having finished the game, i can say they spoil a lot of things, like some demons returning, the final boss (which in the game is forshadowed only near the end) and a lot of gameplay elements and maps. Such a tragedy when i look back at the feelings i had when discovering that in game, please don't watch promotional material of this game, the bfg 10k level's first 10 minutes then you will know if you wanna buy this game or not. Conclusion: To me, it's a brilliant return to the roots, in terms of game design/level design phylosophy but also a clear evolution for the series and the fps genre as a whole. Playing other fps will feel kinda boring after this and the game immerse you so much in the massacre you're commiting that you'll have to take a deep breath and a good piss in order to return to normal life after you take it down. Excellent game, would gladly buy a solo expansion with more maps that use the full arsenal you get in the final stages of the game. would have been goty if mario bros 2 didn't exist."
291,vas060985,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"Well, I liked the game. It's fast-paced with strategy playing a key component. You cannot just go around spamming one weapon, you need to think, act fast and make multiple decision at the same time. Yes, initially I found it challenging (I died many times during the gameplay) but now got used to it. Regarding the story, I like how it ties in doom 1,2 and 64. Music is brilliant. I highly recommend the game but at the time before buying look at a few gameplay videos on youtube or other streaming platform and then decide if it's for you."

294,aLonelyGamer,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"This game is awesome! One thing that kind of bothered me was the *weapon presentation*. When you first come across another weapon, it is just floating, while in Doom 2016, it was presented to you very well. For example, the combat shotgun in Doom 2016, when you come across it, you see it in a soldier's hands, while in Doom Eternal, you see it floating. It ruins the _imersion_. But The game compensates this with the *platforming*, *music*, *gore*, *gunplay*, *story*, *visuals*, *level design*, and *upgrade system*. This, for me, it set an example of contemporary fps games, just like Doom 2016, but improved almost every feature of it. If you value this genre, this title is essential. Another upgrade is the *game size*. It went from almost _70 GB_ of space to _40GB_, which made it effortless and quicker to download, and also saved me a *lot* of SSD space. It is, overall one of the finest fps games of 2020 for me. I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes a challenging, yet fun, video game!"
295,boltthrower669,"Mar 29, 2020",9,"Background - I beat game on nightmare. This is one of the best shooter campaigns I've played in 20 years. The game is a true evolution from the first one, and a masterclass in game design. Every gun/ability is a part of a tool-set that rewards the player for learning how to use it by providing the ability to eviscerate enemies with surgical precision at lightening speed.. I'm sure those looking for a mindless shooter may not appreciate that aspect of the game or its skill requirements. For those people, I'd honestly recommend passing on this,  For everyone else, this is a must buy. The only thing that stopped me from rating it a 10 was the lack of a more robust multiplayer. While fun, I question Battlemode's longevity and balance. For those unaware. Battlemode is where one player plays the slayer fighting against two player controlled demons."
296,AlexirYo,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"I can easily say that Doom Eternal is the best first-person shooter I have ever played, surpassing the previous best; Doom 2016. After years of waiting for Eternal, I had pre-ordered it for my PS4, but couldn't wait any longer and impulsively bought it for PC on March 19 and played it until 5 in the morning. The whole game feels like the trailers, with the amazing visuals making you feel like the Doomslayer, also known as the biggest badass of videogame history, and complemented by that killer soundtrack, it really makes Doom Eternal one of the best videogame experiences of all time. I love this game so freaking much and so should you."
297,shinshiets,"Mar 31, 2020",10,"This bad boy kills the FPS genre with even MORE aggressiveness than the last game. Most of the FPS games I've played is ""hide behind and wait for the other guy to stop shooting"". Every DOOM game (except doom 3, which on it's own, isn't bad, but if it's DOOM. it sure as hell shouldn't be horror.) knows how to make an FPS game which makes it worth your time. I hate a lot of people giving this game a negative score when they straight up say that they had an hour or two of game play, or are very nostalgic and don't like ""Mario jumping"", low ammo or how one demon out of 34 demons in the game managed to piss you off. If you seriously can't handle the demons, just switch to a lower difficulty, there is no judgment, you play how you want. (you can also use cheat codes in any mission you want, if you found them in-game)"

Music forcibly pumps adrenaline and gives you feels of the game.The lore of every boss is great.The bosses were easier than 2016 Doom And the most annoying enemy was marauder he was so **** tanky and can deflect every attack .If you like Doom franchise you will absolutely **** love this game
299,Vla__Dimir,"Mar 31, 2020",10,"Without a doubt this the best DOOM game i ever played (i did play all of them, excluding the console spin offs).Doom 2016 was merely a warm-up for the symphony of violence that is this game, yes it is hard (played on nightmare mode, but it is quite doable).I never write reviews, but the thing that made me write this is the jarring reviews from more than a few edgelords on youtube and the internet as a whole. I agree that it can be soul-crushing but it is fair every time, and finishing every inch of the game comes with a true feeling of PRIDE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT.Marauder (shield axe guy) got a lot of flack due to peculiar timing needed to defeat him.. once you get his rythm he is super easy.. don't give up.Argument can be made that it is only about killing demons, but if that bores you doom is not for you. It is made to be gameplay focused. And it stay fresh to the very end. Will play again and again. Corona is temporary, but DOOM is eternal. Stay safe my dudes!"
300,thenotdeadmemer,"Mar 31, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal is one of, if not the best FPS I’ve ever played. Great combat flow, intriguing bosses, and a **** ton of weapons to use. I’m only giving it a 9 for these reasons.1. Only online mode at launch is battle mode, it’s fun, but gets old after a while. Would have been nice to just have slayer battles again.2. There is more than the max on some story upgrade items, which defeats the purpose of 100%ing the game and really triggers my OCD.3. **** MARAUDERS, THESE **** HEADS ARE SO **** ANNOYING, THEY ARE EITHER THROWING THIER DAMN AXES AT YOU, SHOOTING THE **** OUT OF YOU, OR SUMMONING CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG TO BITE YOUR ASS.

301,lpmusicon,"Apr  1, 2020",10,"This game is a lot better than DOOM 2016. It's way more challenging on the same difficulty levels, game is more enjoyable in every aspect. Right after I finished it went back to DOOM 2016 to make sure I wasn't overhyping myself and IT IS truly better. Combat feels way more fun, weapon juggling, chainsaw refueling gives you super fluid gameplay that 2016 can only dream off. It's like they merged Unreal Tournament and Quake's DNA into this one. Finished DOOM 2016 twice, this however is way more replayable. Story is fun, it's not a movie, just some quick cutscenes that can be skipped if you really don't care about the story. People seem to forget that you can skip it altogether if you're here only for Ripping and Tearing enemies. I guess people can't enjoy games that aren't super simple. It's solid arena shooter with great levels, good platforming, awesome guns and hell it's a DOOM game in 2020."
302,klo45,"Apr  3, 2020",10,"Its diffrent than 2016 doom. It changed many things for the better. No weapon or equipment feels useless and no weapon is an ""i win"" button (man the gauss cannon from 2016 was OP AF) . The combat is much more demanding from the player and way faster. Upgrades and runes are also more balanced and searching for secrets is for me much better than the way doom 2016 did those. Oh and about the plaforming. Usually i hate platforming with all of my body. I hate platforming games i hate platforming in action games and i despise platforming in shooters and i never felt  annoyed by Ethernals . It was a just a break from ripping and tearing that i needed and the longer you play the less of it there is imo. Now i don't think the game is a 10/10 im rly only giving it that score cuz there is no way that the 7,6 it has now is in any way shape or form reflecting on how good this game is its at the very least as good as doom 2016. I think some folks just expected it to cure cancer or something and they are dissapointed that is ""just"" a doom game"
303,mantips,"Jun  3, 2020",9,"I've put over 100 hours into Doom 2016 because it's so fun to replay. I love getting into the flow state and strategizing in real time. Doom Eternal took some adjustment, as many of my old strategies did not work out the box. Once I got the new flow, I grew to love it. There's an insane amount of work that's been put into this game. Every single demon serves a purpose, and they really push you to understand how to take down each type. At first, this annoyed me--I wanted to just pound everything with the same weapon. But Eternal forces you to think harder. You have to prioritize enemy types and learn (often the hard way) which ones to save for last, vs which to take out immediately. Once that prioritization was in my brain, I had to learn the new rhythm of ammo/health/armor management. In a way, Eternal makes this easier than 2016: there are infinitely spawning fodder that can be farmed for resources. Fire = armor, glory kill or ice bomb = health, chainsaw = ammo. Mixing and matching the various mechanics to recoup was really effective. However, it has an odd side effect: the new mobility options make the player so fast that you can typically run away from a big boy who's beating you up and just keep running until you've found enough fodder to be at full health/armor/ammo. This was useful in allowing me to turn the tide of a battle that was going poorly. However, one thing I liked about 2016 was that the options for recovery were limited--you basically needed to not get in too  much trouble in the first place. That made 2016 better at forcing high performance at all times. In Eternal, you can screw up, then panic and run laps until you're OK again. They did introduce things like whiplashes and marauders that seem really good at interrupting a panic lap, which I appreciate. But in the end, I felt Eternal's new mechanics made it so forgiving that they had to make the battles that much more hectic. In the end, I loved finishing Eternal. The scale was jaw dropping, and the demon designs were fantastic. It runs incredibly well. There are some things I'm lukewarm on. Platforming was hit or miss. Some sections I legit enjoyed, others were tedious and not well designed. Also, there are too many meters to track when the game is this insane. I absolutely cannot keep track of whether my ice grenade, frag grenade, chainsaw, or blood punch were ready to go. In practice, there's never enough time to look and think ""is my blood punch ready?"" Instead, you just go on instinct. I think cooldowns work better in slower games. The final boss fights were way more fun than the spider mastermind in 2016. However, no boss fight in Eternal was as good as Cyberdemon from 2016! But in the end, I loved Eternal. It's made some great innovations to the genre and I'm excited to see its influence on future FPSs. Ultimately, I only docked one point from a perfect score because I have died multiple times in ways that felt unreasonable. For instance, when there's so much going on that I literally cannot see a demon through all the on screen effects, then it kills me, it's a bit frustrating since I could not possibly have avoided it. The best deaths are the ones where I'm left thinking ""Oh if I'd done something different I could have avoided that!"" Most of the time, Eternal does that well, but more than 2016 I found myself dying from unavoidable stuff I never saw coming."

305,CI7YSIS,"Apr 26, 2020",9,"upgrade every aspect of the first doom, is even more difficult because there is a lot more hard enemys at once and you need to use the correct weapons, the fight are way more dynamic, they even put some back story about the doom slayer, vega, samuel hayden, and story about the new race aka, the maykrs, who use the hell dimension to consume worlds to their ""long live"", relly good story about hell there,  the soundtrack is spectacular, i dont know why people doesnt like, the only bad part of this doom is the platform parts, they maybe be too confusing sometimes, and the hud and menu are terrible bad btw."

309,IsshinAshina,"Apr  6, 2020",10,"I was a big fan of Doom (2016) when that came out, despite finding the last act of the game to drag a fair bit. So naturally my expectations were quite high, but Doom Eternal has exceeded these high expectation. Doing the first run on Nightmare was the best single player FPS experience I've ever had. The combat is brutally fast, chaotic and violent. You're always short of health and ammo, and need to adapt to the game's rules in order to survive. Quickly you start getting into a certain rhythm and learning efficient ways to take out the disgustingly cool demons. The art design is amazing, animations very creative and gory, the soundtrack even heavier than in the first doom. The guns sound and feel incredible. i dare say that this game has the coolest weapons of any game in recent years (if not ever). The locations you visit are all visually distinct now (unlike the previous game), and this coupled with enemies and weapons continuously being introduced throughout the game keeps it interesting and exciting. The game is a bit longer than Doom 2016, but due to these improvements doesn't feel like it's dragging at all towards its end.I can see how the platforming can be boring to some, but I didn't mind it as it, along with the hunting down of secrets and doing the challenges, provided a good break from the pure annihilation of the big fights. The Nightmare difficulty is quite brutal, and sometimes frustrating, but it pushes you to learn how to play which only makes you feels more badass by the end. If you're familiar with FPS games I definitely recommend playing on this setting (the difficulty can be changed at any time in the settings menu).It feels like some enemies are straight up OP, but then you discover weapons and strategies that are even more OP against them. It's a great feeling. I did encounter several bugs during my run, but nothing gamebreaking. Overall it was a great game and amazing experience. I strongly recommend it to everyone who likes fast, skill-based games. To me this is an early contender for GotY."
310,MrBrownerino,"Apr  6, 2020",10,"This game is a masterpiece. Every aspect of this game was meticulously crafted to create the most metal, intense, blood-pumping experience ever. This game could easily become the best shooter of 2020, if not the best shooter of the decade. And to clarify, we are talking about Half-life Alex here. Trust me, it's that good. Every aspect, from the visuals, gameplay, and design were implemented to create the most satisfying game I have ever played. When it comes to action-packed gameplay, I have yet to see an FPS that surpassed Doom Eternal. Even I was skeptical about this game. When I first saw the updated interface I was very angry. The cool thing is, is that these developers are very good at their job. They overhauled the interface to what it is now. Even if it is still apparent and full of color, I think it works well. I say that confidently, even though  I am huge nitpick when it comes to interface. I can even make the interface red, thank God. This properly shows how much Id cares for their fans. Not that bitter, ignorant, and frankly thoughtless crowd of people who claim that 2016 was better. Honestly, I don't think it's even possible to convince them otherwise, considering that their reviews are only filled with the same three bad things about the game over and over again. It takes a lot of closemindedness to come to the conclusions that they do. People like that don't want to try anything new and hate having to think when they play a game. Spoilers, you actually have to think when you play this game. I find it almost impossible to say 2016 was better than Eternal. It almost makes me think that these people didn't play the game all the way through, and got overly frustrated on one aspect of the game you could easily ignore. I don't know why the loot economy was so hard for people to cope with too. Just chainsaw and flame belch occasionally. It's the easiest part of the game, honestly. Finally, a doom game that makes you manage resources and think a little bit. If only more games were like that. A relatively small part of this game that people love to complain about is the platforming. The platforming just was a brief and fun way to bridge the gap between various locations.  For once the thing separating different arenas wasn't just a hallway. It seems that things that made the game awesome, like verticality, more weapons, and more demons seemed to be the common complaint listed in these negative reviews. Doom Eternal improved upon all aspects of 2016, and I mean all of them. All of the true flaws of this game like the purple sludge, and occasional encounters with the marauder, were newer smaller problems that Doom Eternal created on its own. For you to hate this game, you needed to already hate all platforming, any form of cutscenes, even the short and good ones, and anything more colorful than a couple of greys and oranges. Luckily these diehard, lazy, close-minded reviewers are in the vast minority. In short, this game is very very good. Nothing, under no circumstances, should keep you from buying this game. Yes, this is incredibly different than 2016, but also immensely more enjoyable. Id outdid themselves by a landslide in every way. This is, by far, the best game I have ever played. But honestly, the multiplayer was pretty wack."

313,Pwyasu6,"May 15, 2020",10,"Awesome game improved on 2016 in almost every aspect from combat, movement, enemy and level design. Some of the bad reviews are extremely misleading. Low ammo is not much of a problem in this game if you switch your weapons, don't spam ammo like a moron and accurately target the weak points of the demons. The chainsaw fuel generously regenerates quickly, chainsaw ammo is abundant in the world and as you level up their are ammo increasing upgrades. The complaints of platforming is also weird considering the game sparingly uses it and is simply expanded on 2016 platforming levels"
314,jl_garza,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"So many whiners giving low ratings because of the new mechanics and the story cutscenes.  These kind of people are never satisfied.  If they had produced literally just more Doom 2016 levels, they would have complained that they didn't do anything, or that it's just more of the same, or boring.  Hell, they even say this is boring.  I've played 20 hours so far, and I'm a completionist, so I'm getting every item and taking a deep look at the lore and story.  I have been playing this since 1993, and to see where they took the story makes me feel so fulfilled.  Calling it a ""satanic cartoon"" is pretty ridiculous.  Do you realize how NOT realistic the premise is to begin with?  What were you expecting?  It is a fake story, but a very cared and loved one to both devs and fans alike.  I personally feel like I'm getting SO MUCH MORE than I wanted from this game.  Those complaining about graphics being worse...I can't even.  I am playing this on PC with a 2080 Ti on the highest settings on a CRG9 49"" UW...5120x1440 at 120 FPS...no lag...the textures and details are astounding and the best graphics of any game I own PERIOD.  While other games offer these settings, it's usually at the cost of some performance.  id knew this and really made this work for such a fast-paced game. Bottom-line, you can't please everyone..that's for sure.  It's harder with the new mechanics, but, to me, in a good way...and I really feel like I have to work to be UNSTOPPABLE.  In DOOM 2016, I feel like I was too strong..and the game was much easier.  I feel a reward for playing intelligently and being strategic...and the speed is INSANE.  The level designs are MASSIVE and fit arena style playing, which...I mean, do I even have to say that id's games are all this way?  Sigh...just watch videos to see if you want it or not.  This reviewer has been a fan of id since Wolf3D, and I am SO happy to be seeing where they are today."

323,Magusware,"Mar 26, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal is a fantastic game and a spectacular sequel to 2016s entry into the series. The game delivers on what was promised; in spades. Plenty of demon mulching! With a recharging chainsaw (only up to 1 pip though) you never feel that ammo is a problem. If you do, then simply put, you, as a player, are doing something wrong; like not alternating weapons or killing too much fodder early on. The Battlemode is a lot of fun too!, teaming up with a buddy as demons 2 v 1 against another player who plays as the Doom Slayer with everything unlocked is every bit as chaotic as you would hope. That said, the matchmaking does need a LOT of work."
324,ARGuy,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"DOOM: Eternal. . .that's all I need to say really. The gameplay is fast paced and brutal, it gives you an adrenaline rush by just being 3 seconds in a battle. The level design is incredible with massive areas to look at in the background along with arenas that have nice and convenient things such as some good ol' monkey bars that help you swing around the place. Guns feel great along with some nice movement upgrades such as the grapple hook and the dash that you get later in game that only amps up the adrenaline rush-like experience. The music is fantastic as always, but for some reason I didn't hear the little jingle you would get in between glory kills like you did in 2016 (it helped to show how cool the soundtrack was in 2016). Now the multiplayer is good, but I would still like to see a variety of gamemodes in it still. The story is alright, they don't really explain some things but WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? DOOM doesn't give a **** about story, it's all about the gameplay and music that just you want to hook up to your veins. If you are a fan of shooters, I definitely recommend this game to you."

Hats off to you!I really don't understand the lack of brainpower in the rest of reviews claiming it's ""too different than the previous game"", ""too many puzzle's"" (if jumping is a puzzle to you, maybe you should stick with play with Legos), ""awful story, awkward pacing"" etc.Why are you people trying to make yourself not enjoy the game? Why does the fact that a fun game is fun bother you so much? You are absolutely the worst part of this DOOM community. Take that stick out of your backside that you shoved in yourself and try to enjoy what is probably the best FPS game in the last 20 years."
328,doomslayyerr,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"Well, we all know how good the first game was. The gameplay, gunplay, the chaos the amazing soundtrack, it has everything. Some dubbed it as the best fps ever. But Doom eternal is better than its predecessor in every possible way. They tweaked the best parts of Doom 2016 and made them better. And improved in some ares which needed improvements. The story in every doom game is like an bonus feature. You dont need it but its there. But in Doom Eternal the took the story from Doom 2016 and made it better. Its not just slaying demons anymore now you have a meaningful story to play for but as I said the story is just a bonus. Now let’s talk about gameplay, Its fast. Very fast. Like no other fps. Well if you played Doom 2016 you know what exactly I’m talking about. Fast, fun, Chaotic. That’s what doom is all about. And yes Glory Kills. The best new thing they added to the franchise in 2016 got better in Eternal. You have more glory kills Than doom 2016 and its satisfying as ever. Eternal is challenging than 2016 too. With less ammo to start up and also no unlimited ammo pistol  So you really have to count your shots strategies every encounter and use your chainsaw accordingly. And in higher difficulty youll day. Alot. So stack uo those extra lives by exploring every level. In this game exploration wont just give you collectables and secrets, It will also give you suit upgrades, Sentinel batteries to unlock more items and upgrades in the fortress of doom. Yes now you have your own fortress where you can see your collectables and unlock tons of items. Theres also the slayer rooms in every level. You’ll get the slayer key by beating the slayer rooms and unlock a super weapon which i wont spoil. Every side stuff has rewards for late game. But it wont hurt you if you dont do them. And yes you can customise your slayer with different suits unlocked by collecting sentinel batteries. Now game design. Its better than 2016. The engine produces more colour which makes each level more vibrant. The guns also got major redesigns which make them loom like og Doom counterparts. The demons also got redesign to make them look like og doom counterparts which is pure fan service from id software. The sound design is brilliant. Better than any other game out there. And with the best soundtrack in the history of everything, its a complete blast to play through. I even sat down on the main menu just to enjoy the main menu theme. Now level design. It felt kinda linear to me. But the platforming section are a great addition to this game. Where doom 2016 was sometime confusing and caused a lot of back tracking during my play through. but eternal was straight forward. No backtracking. Just go to the objective and kill demons. So finally I think this game is goty material. This year we’ll see some most hyped and anticipated game releases. so lets see if they can catch up with DOOM. Final verdict is a solid 10/10 For me. Must buy. Go buy it. And stay home and slay the demons!"
329,musikman91307,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"Definitely a must play. I haven't enjoyed a campaign like this since Halo. It's one of those games that seems like it would get repetitive but it finds ways to keep you engaged and entertained. I like that it's not all brainless kills and that you actually have to put thought into what weapons you use and how you manage to reach the various objective points. This is already a serious contender for shooter of the year for me (and possibly one of the best of all time), and looks to be the peak of the Doom series."
330,hwdstener312,"Apr  1, 2020",10,masterpiece never thought it would have been this good lol don't listen to trolls this game is a masterpiece
331,DJKrimson,"Mar 23, 2020",8,"Pretty different than Doom 2016 yea, but I still had a good time playing this. It's still very fun combat and good music. The biggest difference for me is that you can see all secrets on your map, which interrupts you between every other fight because you need to find a hidden path that leads to it. Personally i like that, it provides some variation and makes it possible to 100% every chapter if you wanna play that way (it becomes kinda slow paced). Didn't really care much about the story so can't say much about that."
332,D4nt3Soul,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Best shooter of the generation. It's a masterpiece, without a doubt. It's made with love and details."
333,Gearetic,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"DOOM Eternal is what I have been looking for in a single player FPS campaign in a very long time. It is, on all accounts, unapologetically a video game and oozes character. It is incredibly fast, fluid, brutal and has a high learning curve whose payoff keeps urging you to go back in and try as many times as it takes to master it. Becoming familiar with Eternal's surprisingly wide range of tools, abilities and arsenal may seem daunting at first, but listening to what the game is trying to tell you will inevitably lead you down the path of becoming the ultimate Slayer and having one of the most robust power fantasies a video game can offer. The storytelling is simplistic and never takes itself too seriously, it's all very tongue-in-cheek and mostly serves the purpose of making you feel powerful and entertained. All of the lore in the codex is very interesting to read and paints a poetic picture of Hell, demons, sentinels, angels, gods, etc. It all feels like straight out of a comic book. The art style and visuals are simply stunning and inspired. Everything from the environment variety, enemy designs, weapons designs and overall visual flair looks and feels very nostalgic and full of character. The new engine is something to behold. The amount of detail and chaos that can be present on screen at times is simply staggering especially given how well this game runs on most machines. It inevitably has to, since FPS is what matters most in such a fast-paced FPS...The amount of split second decision making and precision required is what calls for as smooth of an experience as possible and id Tech 7 delivers more than anyone could have hoped for. The game loop itself is made deeper and more diverse with the inclusion of resource management and expanded movement mechanics. Playing a typical combat loop really does feel like a form of ""speed-chess"", in which you have to always be considering what pieces are on the board and using the appropriate tools in response for the most efficient demon slaying. Once you get into the habit of glory-killing for health, burning for armor and chainsawing for ammo, it all starts to come together into a coherent frenzy of destruction since the one and only way you manage those resources is by brutally ripping and tearing your foes out of existence. The dash ability, monkey bar swings and wall climbing have all contributed to diversifying the experience further and adding some much needed variety and verticality to the level design as well as making you feel more in control of the combat (once you master it). Numerous platforming sections throughout the game break up the combat and are pretty fun in my opinion. Due to the game's fluidity, this has got to be some of the best platforming ever put into an FPS game, although it might not be your style. The plethora of exploration, collectibles, secrets and challenges will give you plenty to do well after you've completed the campaign and the game still has more to offer on top of that in the form of Master Levels (levels you've already beaten but with new and more plentiful enemy placements), and the game's brand new multiplayer mode: Battlemode -which is arguably the game's weakest link as of right this moment. Battlemode pits 1 Slayer against 2 player-controlled demons in an arena battle in which either side must get a best-of-5. The Slayer must rely on his skills and aggression in order to succeed while the demons must utilize strategy in order to corral the Slayer. It's still pretty early to judge whether this mode is balanced at all, although I can say that where it lacks fidelity is in some of the animation, effects work and, most notably, lag. It doesn't feel quite as precise as it should, although it is a neat concept that simply lacks some refinement and content.Although Battlemode is interesting, it might not be enough alone to sustain the game's longevity. Luckily, id Software have already committed to releasing at least 4 paid campaign DLC's and will soon be adding a new Dark Souls-esque invasion mode to the campaign for free. That, new Master Levels and Battlemode content will all be releasing for free as well. On top of all of this, id has managed to include an non-paid sort of battle pass system, which rewards various cosmetics upon earning XP and leveling up. There are no strings attached to this, it is all earnable by simply playing the game. No microtransactions whatsoever (don't even think about it Bethesda). I cannot say enough about Mick Gordon's new soundtrack. It all sounds like a more refined version of what he did for DOOM 2016, with some added variety. It's more atmospheric and distinct while still retaining that brutal, metal quality. I can think of at least several specific tracks right off the top of my head, unlike 2016 where I can only remember BFG Division and Rip and Tear. Great stuff. DOOM Eternal is worth its price and the most brutal fun you can have in a video game."
334,Hack,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"A technical masterpiece, the new IDTech Engine 7 is incredible. I didn't encounter a single stutter, hitch or major frame rate drop during my entire playthrough, it runs insanely well for how good it looks. As with Doom 2016, the gameplay is fast and fun, but a little bit different this time around, with the melee ability being next to worthless, but instead chainsaw ammo replenishes over time up to 1 bar and the ammo for it is more plentiful than 2016. This is important because ammo is extremely scarce, possible too scarce so you will often need to chainsaw fodder enemies to regain some ammo. The main new gameplay mechanic is wall climbing where you can latch onto walls, this is used a lot throughout the game, too much in my opinion, there is a ton of parkour in Doom Eternal. Swimming is also a thing now, for some reason, it’s not needed in Doom but thankfully it’s used sparingly. The music is on point as you’d expect from a Doom game, with heavy metal pumping from start to finish, as well as fantastic audio in general. Overall the game is a ton of fun with a few downsides, and one awful mission in particular, but even still it’s impressively well made and hard to put down."
335,Ender7887,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"A truly incredible experience. I was truly blown away by this game, the game keeps you on your feet constantly throwing different demons at you. Each demon has their own weak points and you have to master getting ammo, armor and health from each demon. There’s never a dull moment in the game.  The weapon upgrades are incredible and let you shred through demons with each upgrades.The environments are incredible and make doom 2016 look bland and boring. Throughout the levels there are several collectibles that allow you to access them in your base and look at things like character models, or they let you listen to music from past Bethesda games. The game actually has a cohesive story and there’s tons of lore in the game. Overall this game is a 10/10, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good fps."
336,damschiavini,"Mar 25, 2020",10,"the best arcade shooter so far, excellent graphics, sound, music and perfect sense of control.I also read from critics that using a controller would be a bad idea, losing control of the flow of combat .. well, it's not true, even using the xbox controller, doom eternal remains the most reactive and flawless shooting experience in almost all difficulty levels. unlike doom 2016 you will have to spend much more time in the air to keep enemies under your sight and avoid damage, and the combat shotgun will be a less effective weapon .. The different vulnerabilities of the enemies and the less frequent ammunition will force you to use all your weapons in almost every battle.I highly recommend doom eternal both for those who use mouse / kb and for those who use a controller"

339,myboi123,"Mar 26, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal improves on almost every mechanic from Doom (2016), and I can safely say that this is my Game Of The Year as of now."
340,progamerr,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"The famous DooM come back to us in 2016. Bethesda did a great job. With DooM eternal they continue this perfection. Every feature in the 2016 version more improved and much better. I have to admit, this game gave me a big pleasure. If you like the previous version, don't lose any second and take it right now. Fast and bloody playstyle, which is the origins of DooM, presents to us magnificently. A game can't even better. Bethesda deserves every compliment."
341,TheLastArchive,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal has improved on Doom 2016 in almost every way. The addition of improved mobility, a heavier reliance on resource management, chainsaw and flame belch really takes this game to the next level. I see a lot of people complaining since they struggle to grasp the new gameplay style of Eternal compared to 2016 which was a more simple gameplay loop. This game requires a little bit more effort. My only legitimate complaints where the purple goop (a minor nitpick and not a common occurrence but I didn't really enjoy myself being glued to the floor and having to fight hell knights by tanking punches to the face) And the Marauder, an enemy that completely halts the gameplay and forces you to focus on him. He's not a challenging enemy, he's just an annoyance, especially when paired with other enemies in the arena. I feel like he's bugged, sometimes you hit him perfectly with the ballista while his eyes are flashing and he won't stagger, other times he will. Sometimes he doesn't obey his own ""mid-range"" rule and will fire his axe beams at medium or even close range. Unlike the other enemies in the game, he requires a specific style of play and he's not fun to go up against. If he was a one time enemy, then I wouldn't mind as much."
342,AdamP,"Mar 30, 2020",9,"Simply incredible! After the first few years minutes I just didn't feel it. Something was wrong. Felt slow, boring. Tutorial pop ups all the time... Maybe if I were id Software , I would give the tutor role to Vega. Disappointing. It really felt different.I decided to increase difficulty to nightmare. Big change of pace enemies damage more, they are faster and more aggressive. They are slightly tougher, has more HP, but I don't find them bullet sponges.Dashing mechanics added a new meaning of fast. The gameplay is super high paced, and a few mistakes can be near fatal. I almost always found the way to recover, glory kills give HP, chainsaw gives ammo which is more limited than before so you'll chainsaw a lot. The game gives the chainsaw at the beginning. Have fun with it!There are other things to manage and yes, health, armor, chainsaw, ammo management are more crucial than in DOOM 2016. Some might haze this, but I found it good, adds to the excitement, as you'll need to hunt for resources while killing the demons. There are so many close to death moments. So much fun! Or is it? Well on Nightmare it's super fun but the game is so realistic you will feel like Doom Slayer full of rage like you want to destroy your keyboard or throw away your mouse after retrying the same section again and again. Checkpoints are really fair thankfully. I like the setting of DOOM Eternal a lot. It's a lot more varied, And the attention to details are insane! Eye candy everywhere. The scenery is fantastic, breathtaking and sometimes disgusting, crazy. You take a screenshot at many points and you basically get a fantastic metal album cover! Glory kills, damage on the demons are improved. Weapons are cool, plazma is finally useful, BFG is now a normal weapon, weapon mods are great and all of them are situational, they don't become obsolete. Mick Gordon did a fantastic job with the soundtrack tough I liked 2026's soundtrack more. However the heavy metal choirs are good as hell! Story is good, but if you don't care about it, it fine. You'll still be able to enjoy the game. Worth noting the optimization too. It's incredible, many game developers should learn from it! I have butter smooth 60 fps on my RX 570 on high settings that already looks nice but dynamic resolution scaling kicks in a lot to maintain the performance. Loading times are shorter, levels are huge! Eternal is a step up from the earlier game. More complex yet fast paced with some space to breath between big fights. If you don't mind the resource management in this game, you'll love it!"
343,KratosMaori,"Mar 30, 2020",10,Not sure what these kids are talking about but for anyone that enjoys a fast paced brutal fps this game is for you. if you have a hard time with basic puzzles (Like put the circle in the circle slot not the square spot) then this game is not for you. Violent and rewarding go for it bud rip and tear until it is done.

346,Quadrapole,"Apr  2, 2020",10,"Its even better than the original. Increased abilities, faster movement and very well done pacing. I'm amazed that Doom Eternal actually fleshed out more of a story line. No SJW content, fast paced gaming that makes you feel like a god. Great game, better than Doom 2016 and a great soundtrack as well."
347,jaques0311,"Apr  4, 2020",10,"Old school doom fan here. Loved the originals and the 2016 reboot. I have to say, I'm liking where they are taking this series. Fast paced, pure adrenaline and testosterone. It is a very challenging game even on lower difficulties. Im not gonna talking about little things here and there, but I really did not like some of the platforming, and the ""mario-esque"" ball chain fire thingys, kinda lame. over cool game."
348,escruting,"Apr  5, 2020",9,"I liked it more that Doom 2016. The story felt more cohesive and better laid out across the different missions. The new platformer aspects didnt annoy me and i think the gameplay feels more complete with them, although in a couple of places i felt some jumps were too difficult.Great adrenaline pumping game with great weapons, great sound, great music (again) and IMHO more varied environments than on Doom 2016. If you can play it at 120fps, do it, it feels a lot better than 60fps, even if you have to lower some graphics settings. It makes a lot of difference in games with this frenetic action. The game has great optimization, so it will run well on a lot of hardware. I gave Doom 2016 a 7.5, this one gets a 9 from me."

350,IguanasSmegma,"Apr  6, 2020",10,"So according to most of the SOY BOYS the game should be easier and having saves and ammo all over the place?  What would be the point in dying in the game?  DO YOU WANT A WALKING SIMULATOR?  Go play Animal Crossing or some NINTENDO  and leave this to the grown ups. The ammo system is just fine. If you played Doom before you know how to get it.  The chainsaw pretty much refills your ammo.  If you do a glory kill which is freaking easy you get health.  I died just a few times in this game.  I don't know what else do you guys want from an old school fast pace.  I think any difficulty other than Nightmare in this game is a piece of cake.  The atmosphere is awesome too.  All the lore about the secret bases from the government gives us immersion too.  This game is 10/10 to me.  All the negative reviews from these delicate kids makes me wanna puke.  Everyone is entitled to your own opinion, but, if you're playing a hardcore game full of graphic violence you shouldn't expect for SOY MOMENTS.  Period!"
351,Norfside,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Very fun game. Just finished on ultraviolence and starting a new playthrough to 100 percent the game on nightmare. The gunplay is better than 2016 but takes some getting used to as it is different but so so much better. Soundtrack rules and the sound design is meaty and satisfying. Best shooter I have played in 15 years

353,Soapyyyy,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"This is a great game. It takes doom 2016, a fat rip of cocaine and testosterone, and proceeds to give you the juicy demon slaying you want. Some of the puzzle elements can be annoying at times but I can look past that with how much fun this game is. And the fact that you get og doom, doom 2 build into the game as Easter eggs, and it came with doom 64 for preordering is just amazing."

355,LaurenN23,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"I fell in love with this game. This is the best FPS game I have ever played so far. I played DOOM (2016) and that game couldn't be more different from the latest instalment. I especially love the faster gameplay and new mechanics like the dash, shoulder mounted grenade launcher or the flame belch. The pace is really something different from DOOM (2016), and in my opinion it's a good thing. I love DOOM (2016) but this experience was something entirely different. You really need to think before you shoot, choose your weapons and mods accordingly and manage your resources. It's basically impossible to beat this game with your two favourite guns and the game constantly reminds you fo that. The combination of Mick Gordon's kickass riffs, your arsenal of various weapons with various mods and the forces of Hell and ""Heaven"" going against you really makes you feel like an angry powerhouse of flesh and steel. Now to the platforming. Honestly, I kind of liked it. It was a pleasant little ""break"" after a bloodbath of demons and I loved looking for secrets and collectibles. I F-ing love this game and I'm looking forward to a second playthrough on Nightmare difficulty."
356,SirKillsalot101,"Mar 23, 2020",9,"A fantastic evolution of Doom 2016's combat with some caveats. 1. The chainsaw is mandatory this time. Ammo is restricted and you will need to integrate all of your tools into your gameplay and keep them working in synchronicity. 2. Early in the game the restrictions on ammo feel oppressive. Though this lessons as you get upgrades and more weapons. 3. Early in the game, you have little freedom in how to deal with certain enemies, specifically the cacodemon, for which you have to use a nade into its mouth every time unless you want to spend all of your ammo. 4. The marauder is terribly designed. He goes completely against the ethos of rip and tear/ forward momentum. 5. Doom 2016 had a much better visual style, balancing Doom 3's grit with arcade flourishes. Eternal goes too far in the arcade direction. Other than the above, the game shines in all areas. The combat is visceral, rewarding and frenetic, the soundtrack is fantastic and the graphics shine. All of the enemies besides the marauder are very well designed and the weapons are satisfying."

The combat system is similar however it requires much greater resource management and the skillful execution of demons using the right tools for the job. If you play the game as the developers intend for you to, you will have a blast. This may not come naturally in the beginning but as time goes on, your skills hone in overall making a great combat system that flows extremely well. The soundtrack accompanies your brutality as you rip and tear through demons to feed your rage. 97/100"

363,MiBgunst,"Mar 27, 2020",9,"I'm not going to make a review by putting the pros that shine so much, but instead by going against what people people with a minuscule amount of grey matter is saying:""The game looks like a cartoon"". The game looks amazing with the added colors! Whereas Doom 2016 was made mostly out of red, brown and blue, Doom has the whole palette to please your eyes wherever you go. More color and more detail structures instead of low-polly, rough chunks of rocks (that filled D2016's mars) give you lots of things to stare at""Jumping puzzles"" PUZZLES!? All you have to do is time your dashes and your double jump to grab a ledge, maybe press a switch or cling onto a wall and then you go back to an arena. How low must your IQ be in order to think that jumping to find the way forward needs as much brainwork as a puzzle?""Low ammo! How is this a shooter without bullets!?"". A lot of people seem to be missing what the purpose of this was. We all loved using the chainsaw in 2016, but it saw little intentional use as a *tool* because executions would always give you ammo, health AND (iirc) armor too! Doom 2016 needed agility to dodge projectiles and pick the right gun, although its error frame for this was minuscule and your favourite weapon would do the trick most times. Eternal pushes the way you handle your tools as a brutal and divine force of nature: It encourages you to save your ammo for its intended purpose, and the protips tell you quite clearly what their best use would be, they demand you to dive into the mind of a man made a god that is a clever as he is by making all your equipment useful and necessary; it is a masterful way to force your players to use all you've given them. They're still guns at the end of the day, and even in Nightmare you'll get plenty of room to try out your weapons on whatever hell-born fiend stands in your way.""Pacing is offf!?!?1?"". What the **** do you even mean? ""it's slow?"" Hell no! If you think you can mindlessly rush into the next arena, you haven't played Doom at all! You never stopped to search keys or secrets in Doom 1 or 2 and Doom 2016 might have made it a little too easy. ""They give you so much **** so fast!!!"" One of the very few things I can find a negative to, but it's much better to say that they hurry to give you all of your pretty little toys to massacre demons with than to overwhelming you""Not old Doom!"" Oh boy are you wrong. Let's take a step back to all Doom games (Excepting 3 ofc, because it was a different formula). You move a lot! Do you have that in Doom Eternal? You might walk a tad slower, but you still strafe the whole day and you got even more to do: Boost yourself with the lifts, with the monkey bars and the wall cling is reserved for the platforming sections. Violence? You got that, and even more ways to shed blood than a stupidly viable shotgun, you just can't get accustomed to a slightly bigger challenge""Story bad!"". We have a couple of things to say here: Sure, story is important to give things a bit of sense, but we all know Doom's story is a vessel for your gore fest, not the other way around. If you won't overlook the plot, you'll need to actually stop to breath in the story: Doom 2016 gave you lore somewhat disconnected to the ""Ethically questionable scientists are tricked into breaking hell loose. Fix it"" story, but Doom Eternal gives you a blank space between the games that you'll have to fill in and it won't spoon-feed you a single thing because you actually have to read! Look for the story or don't care about it at all.Doom Eternal is not perfectly built, we all know. The OST is amazing, but sadly you have to stop to actively listen to it instead of the naturally explosive soundtrack in D2016. The amount of enemy variants is ambiguous: Whereas a couple of variants taking the same role might be negative, their aesthetic value and the very small tweaks each one have could be positive. The great void that leads you to the Fortress of Doom can either be silly because of the slight sci-fi fantasy, or engaging in a way that is either funny for the same reason or a small gem of slightly unrestrained creativity. Your base can be a hub that forcefully connects otherwise disconnected areas and just filler content, or a small place that you can breath in to cool your mind and the one-time-fun insight of the Slayer's human side. If you want what Doom was always about, you will find it with some more tool juggling than in the days of yore, but it IS there and it greatly improves from it, even if some of the content aside might feel like filler, but I believe that even if it is filler you might find that it is decently polished."
364,cezar55555,"Mar 28, 2020",10,"This game represents the beginning of a new era of the FPS genre. The negative reviews are very funny to read, 90% of them are from people who don't know how to jump and dash. There are no 'platforming puzzles', you just need to have a functional brain in order to progress. Buy this game if you think killing demons while metal music plays in the background would be fun for you. Don't buy this if you don't know how to play a video game."

You just make simple jumps to achieve other places, and if you fail, you don't even die!

368,Elato5,"Apr  5, 2020",10,"I feel like the hate for this game is too absurd. I mean, people are saying Doom 2016 is much better and that it has better gameplay than Doom Eternal. Although that is an opinion I cannot change, I feel like Doom Eternal is an improvement of Doom 2016. With added mobility and weak points on enemies, it makes the game more difficult but easier at the same time if that makes any sense. For example, the security enemies/ shield guys in Doom 2016 were frustrating to come across at times and they carried out a lot of damage with a lot of defense too. However, In Doom Eternal, you can use a Plasma Rifle to overheat their shields. Which I think is very fair, because they also add a lot more enemies. Now platforming, I don't mind it. I mean although the art style of the game has changed, the action still feels the same mostly and has improved too. People may complain about the games difficulty and no ""ammo"". But it's a dumb argument considering the chainsaw auto-fills one bar and there are always fodder enemies nearby to chainsaw for ammo. If you're having difficulty with the newly added mechanics then that is fine. At first, I was getting used to the new utilities too. But as I progressed through the game, I learned how to combo all my gear at once and to always weapon-swap. Just like in Doom 2016. The lore is also very fascinating, with the story of Doom Slayer and his origins. However, if you're not interested in the lore and just want pure gameplay then you can just skip the cutscenes too. I think the boss fights in this game are a step up too, from Gladiators to the gigantic Icon of Sin. I'm very happy with the game and feel as if it really was worth the money. The game is also very well optimized giving me rarely any stutters and so far no crashes, I am running the game with an RX 580 graphics card and it handles really well. Overall, buy the game. It adds more depth to combat and has an interesting story that concludes most questions from Doom 2016. I rate this 666/10."

374,QueenVega,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"To some peoples dismay this game actually tries to be different to its 2016 counterpart. It's not the same game so don't come in thinking it will be. The game takes 2016s core combat loop, adds to it and improves on it all while improving the overall quality of combat with all new guns and demons. Quick warning to any doom purists the game has SKIPABLE cutscenes and optional lore. The game also didn't hide how it doesn't have traditional death match but instead decided to try something entirely new. However even if the multiplier doesn't appeal to you the campaign alone is worth it. A few short sections were mildly annoying but they weren't long enough to take my 10 to a 9. One more word of warning the game is colorful, your gonna need it with how fast combat is. The game also has a very obvious resource management feature. if you don't like resource management then this game ain't for you as there is a heavy emphasis on it.Overall this game is 100% worth your time weather you played 2016 or not. It's fast gory and bloody good fun once you find your flow. Resource management and relentless combat make for a challenging pair at high difficulties and the parkour sections in my opinion are pretty fun but largely short, providing something to do in-between combat while also allowing more creative ways to access secrets."

378,Nexus14,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"DOOM 2016 was brilliant. Eternal is even more brilliant. However, it is different to 2016. The combat loop is much richer and way more engaging, but the player must embrace it and learn how to do the resource management dance. Once you achieve that, Eternal's combat is simply the most amazing gameplay I have ever experienced in a shooter. Bar none. There are way too many people bashing this game while clearly not understanding its systems. Ammo isn't scarce, you just need to understand how to get it. More than ever before, the game forces you to commit to push forward combat and see your enemies as your main source of resources. If you want to beat the game using 2 or 3 different guns while barely adapting or thinking, like you could in 2016... Well, this is not the game for you. The combat loop is simply brilliant, and it becomes second nature after just a few hours. Everything else is insanely polished. Yes, the game is more arcade looking than 2016. They made a conscious decision to make it as ""videogamey"" as possible, and some people will dislike that. However, I just love the way that this game focuses entirely on one single thing above all others: FUN. The platforming can be slightly inconsistent at times, but don't let anyone tell you that there's too much of it. There is just enough to get a small break from the immense sensory overload that is the combat (of which there is obviously plenty). Same goes for the few puzzles here and there. The levels are big and gorgeous, and exploration is even more rewarding than in 2016. I sincerely believe this game makes 2016 look like a sluggish, slow, one-dimensional shooter in comparison. And I LOVED 2016. It bothers me that so many people seem to be so angry about change that they aren't willing to do what Hugo Martin and the other guys at Id are encouraging them to do. I feel bad for them, because they are really missing out. This is the best FPS combat I have played in my entire life, and I had to leave a review to try and fight all the nonsense in here. If you like shooters even a little bit, you owe it to yourself to play this. That is all."

Despite it's not close to 'Doom's style', I love diversity of ripping, and much evolved juicy glory kills. The backgrounds, if you are still stucked in Doom 64, you can't help blaming this game. Because this game set Slayer free to rip and tear the source of evil, whether it is demons or an angel. So colorful, and Slayer just standing on all of the creatures. Dynamic vertical map design also added, which were not used in classic doom. Why doom should be 2.5D game for 26 years? So rating 0 score to balance 10? 10 can be frank review, 0 can't be. AAA game anyway. And I agree with these dramatic changes."

These are exactly the sorts of games that I want. That said, I like DOOM 2016 a bit better overall myself. In terms of story/atmosphere, DOOM 2016 > DOOM Eternal for ""context""/story/lore -- really liked the ""villain"" in 2016 (they were arguably right depending on how you look at it and they were smart -- took steps to mitigate risk/etc). DOOM Eternal Lore is more like Diablo lore this time around seems to me. Mechanically, there are also two things I'd consider ""regressions"" from 2016. In 2016, you could animation cancel melee between shotgun blasts for example so it was something I eventually got into muscle memory and I actually really liked being able to do with different guns/between abilities/etc. In Eternal though, melee has been changed so that it essentially ""does nothing"" unless you're using your ""finisher"" or the ""blood punch"" feature -- so, animation cancelling doesn't do anything since the melee does -- it seems -- 0 or close to 0 damage outside those circumstances. Also, the chainsaw -- in 2016, on Nightmare/the harder difficulties you could strategically save the chainsaw for ""bigger"" threats/strategic difficult fights since it could be used on all enemies while in Eternal you can only chainsaw ""basic"" enemies and I actually hate that. Still, overall the game is still awesome and there are of course improvements in other areas and it runs really really well -- even totally maxed out at 1440p for me (though I do have a pretty beefy rig) -- like, zero stuttering and it's maybe the smoothest game I've ever played. TL;DR: Game is excellent and I recommend playing it. Also, go play DOOM 2016! Game is a masterpiece you should definitely pick up and play too."

404,harlex,"Mar 21, 2020",9,doom eternal has a wonderful campaign with lots of collectibles and items you can get in a large map. you have allot of upgrades to your weapons and doom slayer. a nice hub area for unlocking more items and seeing the story within the game. the multiplayer is very lacking and not as fun as it was in the original. the new multiplayer is a RTS and FPS mix with the demons being able to spawn other demons to kill the doom slayer. you may miss the snapmap mode that gave so much more content to the last game. the added battle pass like leveling isn't the best and isn't very easy to find. the main menu is lacking in allot just being a doom slayer or demon on a platform.
405,Huskylore,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"Played almost all the campaign, and i have mixed feelings about the game. As a doom fan i loved almost everything new and old in the game, but the combat feels too complex for a doom game, starting in high difficulties might be too stress full for people trying to play the game like doom 16, cause now you have to prioritize more on glory kills and strategy use of your weapons against certain demons, a thing that doesnt feel so brutal like in 2016. Even with that the game is great, with improvements in almost every category and feel that was made with love and dedication. Recommended!"
406,Stump33r,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Now I don’t often write reviews, So Bare with me...Doom Eternal is nothing like Doom 2016, in fact  you could compare them as totally different games. Doom 2016 (Personal score 9/10) Is a classic representation of doom as a franchise. You walk in, punch, shoot, and tear apart everything in your path, literally everything a doom fan could ask for. You didn’t have to worry about ammo, Heath drops, armour shards. You just hopped in. And you killed everything in your path. Now I know this may sound repetitive, but it was a simple as that. Run, shoot, repeat. Now before I talk about Doom eternal. I want mention another game series that gives me more of a Doom Eternal feel. Quake. The original quake games (Quake 2 to be more specific) Took the doom formula and speed it up. When you play quake 2, you move as fast as goddamn possible. In contrast too the original Dooms. They are pretty much carbon copies. Armour shards. Health pickups. And a massive arsenal. Now looking at Doom Eternal it takes a little bit from everything. The Demons from doom. (Plus twice the amount from Doom 2016) the speed from Quake. And meshes it together, with a little extra. Doom Eternal adds resource management, if you try to hop in and play it like Doom 2016 you’re going to fail. Big time fail. The developers of doom eternal wanted the player to be engaged in the game. It slowly teaches you to balance and think about your resources. If you successfully Learn how to balance yourself. You’ll never have any issue with this game. Too wrap it up. I believe this one of the best ID games too date. Is it anything like doom 2016? No. Not at all. Doom Eternal is another step forward in the doom franchise, it’s experimenting with new things and trying to “Perfect” the doom formula. Ps. Resource management can be easy In this game. I haven’t had a single issue with running low on ammo.  Nor amour shards, nor health. Remember. Low on ammo? Your chainsaw refills on its own, look for a minor enemy and you’ll never have an ammo problem Low on armour? Flame belch whoever’s in your way, even if you don’t get a large amount of enemies the smallest amount of armour shards can change the tides of battle.Low on health? Glory kills and killing minors is a quick way to get your health back."
407,reclocco,"Mar 21, 2020",9,This game is about combat and there is a lot to master. TONS of new equipment and moster might even be overwhelming but with every level you can feel your skills increase. Only complaint is a bit too cartoonish style and taking self-awareness to far (doomguys room filled with casual and funny items). I wish thus game was a bit more serious like 2016 was.
408,Blancos4lyf,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Don't read what the other people are saying, this game is better than the 2016 version in every way, people are just complaining because they don't have the capacity to do more than shoot, and using the R key and CTRL key is too much, the lack of ammo is the whole point of the game, so you're left using other weapons, this game is much better than the original as it's more difficult, that's why you play Doom games, not just another shooter, it's one where you're constantly on the move or, dead.Those complaining about lack of ammo are clearly struggling with the game and not enjoying the difficulty and just want to complain."
409,micro_ukr,"Mar 22, 2020",10,i expected a good sequel but holy ****First of all the soundtrack is awesome but i do prefer the 2016 one more but still love it.Second of all the new movement options work perfectly with the new level and arena design allowing you to always be on the move and never stand still.Third of all the new demons are well made and interesting allthough some gave me a bit of trouble but that may just be my fault.my only problem is the final boss being a bit anti-climatic since all you really have to do is shoot certain areas for two phases and thats it. overall great game with only minor issues that can be overlookedP.S.add an option to change the music of levels (i mainly need bfg division for E V E R Y T H I N G)
410,gamertaboo,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"For a FPS, this game is epic. It's like a mix between a Souls-borne challenge with the usual Doom amazing-ness. The visuals are fantastic, easily beat Doom 2016 and might be one of the best looking games out there. The coders at Id are amazing as well, you couldn't ask for a more optimized, better running game. I own the Steam version with Denuvo even, completely maxed out, 8700k and 2080ti at 3440x1440 100Hz and it sits at a locked 100fps all the time without the faintest hint of a dip or stutter or any issue anywhere, anytime. Game runs so good it's almost kind of boring not needing to mess with settings, I hope they add ray tracing at some point to make it more demanding. Can't possibly praise this game or the developers more. Love you Hugo and Marty (and every single other person at the studio who aren't in a ton of YouTube videos!!) Wish you guys weren't tied down by Bethesda honestly. Can't wait for more!"

А игра норм, арены аренами, сюжет сюжетом, чего вы хотели от тупого шутана, где максимум раздумий приходится на выбор пушки для конкретного монстра. Все остальное здесь чисто для галочки. Вот вам аренка, вот вам стволы - меситесь на здоровье. Интерфейс не такой уж и вырвиглазный, мне лично наоборот нравится этот контраст ярких кислотных оттенков и монотонных мрачных тонов. Согласен только насчет платформ - реально подбешивает, в частности эти палки, торчащие из стен, прыгая на которых, ощущаешь себя каким-то е*учим орангутангом, но и оно не сильно портит впечатление об игре.

416,SteveManSteve,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"First of all I get people not liking the extra game mechanics and this definitely has a learning curve of a couple of hours before you can appreciate it. I think once I push past a certain point all the pieces will fall into place, If they'd not changed it up they would have been panned even more for being lazy.I actually stopped playing after being given all the tools in game, as I wanted to take my time remapping the keys to suit me, I didn't want to build up the wrong muscle memory,I'm not very good at FPS in general, but now I'm happy with my key selections, I'm gong to learn the ""dance"" if I can. I'm still a Doom fanboy even though I'm rubbish at FPS gaming. I'm better at the classic Doom games from the 90's.I have an average PC with a Ryzen 1700+ and a 6gb GTX 1060, it ran buttery smooth without touching a single video option.

417,JarrodCastillo,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Had good characters in both design and gameplay. The artwork was great, the music was memorable, bosses were solid, it was a total package. It also did time travel right. It didn't burry you with information overload about the various consequences of jumping through space and time, it was all super understandable and straightforward. Which is something I feel is hard to pull off nowadays. I think that is actually a good point for the game, because so many games have come afterwards and still done time travel wrong. And the tech stuff was great, seeing all those combinations and great synergy between charater attacks were fun. It gave me an excuse to play around with the whole roster often. And while jrpgs tend to tilt on the overdramatic, the game never went overboard on that. Its a perfect blend of fps that is rarely reproduced successfully, which is what makes it great."

420,Niko7664,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"A down-right excellent sequel to the 2016 smash hit Doom. Doom Eternal is everything it’s 2016 counterpart is but much more refined and fluid. This game is less “shoot em’ up” and more strategy based than 2016’s entry in the series. In this game you have to think a lot more than the last game. I really like this because it adds something new. Another thing that is new is the platforming. All though it gets on my nerves sometimes, it is a breath of fresh air. A lot of games will try to sell you the same game you bought a few years ago but this time add a new story. No new gameplay or anything. This game goes against that. Id and Bethesda know they can’t depend on the new graphics to sell this game. That is why they added so many new features. On a technical side of things the game runs perfect. Once I updated my drivers I feel no lag or anything. Before the update I felt a slight lag here and there nothing bad what so ever. The multiplayer is fun, though I wish they would have just added in more modes. They most certainly will. In time. For now though if you are looking for an amazing shooter game this is it. This is the one you were looking for. 10/10 for me."

423,JoduanER2,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Bringing the FPS genre to the next level! Doom 2016 was the base and this is the meat. I didnt like much Doom 2016. I felt that it was missing something, it was repetitive and i felt it didnt needed much strategy. It was shoot this guy with whatever you want then move to the next one and so on. Doom Eternal's enemies each have weak points, more effective weapons against them, and you have a more diverse arsenal. ( i.e. types of grenades, flamethrower which releases armor from enemies, grappling hook in the super shotgun) All of this makes for a gameplay which forces you to THINK. And this part is very important. I even saw an interview in which Hugo Martin said this, and i didnt understand what he meant. Unlike Doom 2016 this game makes you decide at every moment what to use, because each enemy and situation requires a different weapon or part of your arsenal and that makes the gameplay entertaining and engaging. You cant go using the same weapon the whole game and expect to survive.This game really is something special, and if you are a gamer who likes to try the latest innovation in the genre do yourself a favor and buy this game."
424,The_Nametag,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"There are some un""Doom-like"" things in it. The previous game gave the player the ability to jump w/ double jump later, and climbing ledges (quickly, at that). I think that was the right amount of movement for Doomguy. This one adds a dash that can be used twice including in the air, ""monkey bars"" which let the player jump again off then, a hook-shot on your super shotgun, and wall climbing - very quickly at that, and you can jump off the walls. I don't really like these. Especially when the game becomes very platformy, and it's not always good at that. Sometimes it's not clear where you're supposed to go next (even with this game continuing the previous game's ""go green"" color cues). And sometimes you just don't make the jumps regardless. For example, you are supposed to use your melee on the climbable walls to latch on. I cannot tell you how many times Doomguy punched the climbable wall and then fell down it. Sigh. There's also a fair bit of fantasy-inspired lore in the game. Some parts of the game feel more like Quake than Doom (and I'm not the biggest fan of Quake). Whereas the previous game, your character did not care about plot, this game is rich with it. Oh they set some of the stuff for this game up last time, and now they were delivering as if they had to pack the plot left from the previous game into this as well. And, of course, there are bugs. There's at least one soft lock I found, and several other things that just don't work right. None of that is to say this game isn't entertaining. It's extremely fun to play. Overall, I am very happy with it. I just wanted to get the negatives out of the way first. There's plenty of positives. They really did a good job tying the previous games in, and not just in spirit. Yes, you have the classic outfit you can unlock. There's a reason for that. Your character, ""Doomguy"" as he is also referred to in the game, really is the marine that was sent to the moons of Mars to deal with UAC's portal mess. And he really did lose his god damned mind and go back INTO Hell to kill every last demon he could find. And then he was adopted by an ancient order to continue the work, only going so far that even they couldn't really control what they had unleashed. It's great, it fits perfectly. They've thrown a lot of things for the fans, including calling him ""Doomguy"" at several times, and even having a painting of the slayer holding Daisy - his pet rabbit that was seen at the end of the first Doom, and the expanded version. A lot of the collectibles come in the form of music tracks from the series (all the way back to Commander Keen. The game also has cheat codes that you can use when replaying levels, and the best part is those cheat codes don't actually turn off the progression for the levels, so you can find the missing items etc. in them (except for the challenge gates). They added a fast travel system when you're almost done with a level, just in case you don't want to replay it to go back and pick up what you missed. There's master levels as well, remixed versions that are designed to be more challenging. The boss fights are a mixed bag. Some are more annoying than not, but some were a lot of fun to go through. Just as the first game, the first boss comes back as a common enemy throughout. The boss fight where you have to use your hook-shot to punch the flying boss was a real treat, not just for that aspect but the arena as a whole was a lot of fun to play in. The Marauder, that becomes a normal enemy as well, less so. This is an enemy that keeps a shield up and forces you to wait and counter his attacks. Something that doesn't seem to fit at all in the series that has focused on just keep shooting since the beginning. Another let-down is enemies no longer drop ammo unless you chainsaw them (which does at least refill automatically - at least to one pip). This means you will find yourself running out and being forced to switch weapons frequently. Fortunately, I really like most of the weapons in this one. Most. We have a poor substitute to the over-powered Siege Cannon this time out. I've not done the multiplayer yet, but it's the ""two demons vs one Doomslayer"" game mode, that's it. I am fully planning on giving that a shot. The game did come with the ability to unlock and play the first two games in game (now that they added the .wad files for it... whoops), but they used the more draconian BFG censorship - and without even the bonus levels. Yea, I really, REALLY liked this game. I'm glad I have it. I just hope they fix some of the bugs."

426,Nathanga,"Mar 22, 2020",9,So far this game has been awesome. Once you get the hang of the game mechanics its so satisfying ripping and tearing. I can definitely say that i love the demon and weapon variety as well as the environments and soundtrack. The only thing I dislike at this point is runes progression. There really isn't any point in collecting more of them as you go through the game if you've already chosen 3 you like. And to all the people complaining about limited ammo : You need to be strategic about it. You need to farm demons using the chainsaw and conserve ammunition by using abilities like blood punch and the ice/frag grenades. Not to mention you can also upgrade your ammo capacity.

Love that there's finally another Doom that takes place on earth and the art style really benefits from it.  I think this has much better pacing and progression than 2016.  First person platforming may be something you either love or hate, and the stingent requirements for killing demons has a bit of a learning curve.  That may turn some newcomers off (that's why it's not a 10/10) but it's personally exactly what I was looking for in a sequel. Needing the Bethesda account does stink, but I think it's also a bit overblown.  You give them your username/email on the first startup then you never have to aknowledge it again.  I don't like that it's *required* but it's nowhere near worth review bombing a game for."

The story is 10/10, gameplay 9/10, the reason why I am giving this a 9 and not a 10 is that the platforming is pretty bad at times. Everything said the game is fantastic."

446,ClosedRange,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Arguably the best FPS of the decade. Doom Eternal is unashamedly about fast, furious and fun gameplay as a video game, with a lot of new depth to some old school themes. The pumping electro-metal riffs are back from doom 2016, which keep your adrenaline flowing. The richly detaiied apocalyptic environments and scenery are a big improvement over doom 2016 and it gives DE a rich and unique personality. It deserves a 10/10 not because it is perfect, but because it is undoubtedly the best FPS today. Btw - many reviews here claim you need a Bethesda account. That is not true - you can play without a Bethesda account. It's only if you want to unlock online cosmetics (which are all progression based, no microtransactions)."

448,Krille90,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Really good! one of the best FPS games out there atm. Focuses on so many good things that are Doom related and with a bit of Quake stuff as well. Also a good focus on the story for those that care about the lore. The weapons feels absolutely Awesome, the game itself feels good overall. Cons? Maybe to many platforms to jump on? miss a few gun effects from the Doom 2016 game. There are not to many cons for this game. The game delivers really well when it comes to what Doom is about, Gun down your enemies and have fun while doing it. Easily a 9 out of 10."
449,Estacon,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"If you enjoy first person shooters, action, and a challenge: you will enjoy doom eternal. Doom 2016 was a fantastic game that really surprised me with not only its fantastic visuals and gameplay but also soundtrack and plot. Doom eternal one-ups it’s predecessor with an even more intense combat system that will keep even the best of players struggling to hold onto life with difficulties like ultra-violence and nightmare. The plot and visuals are also a welcome upgrade with landscapes one would not expect to see in a Doom game. If you enjoy first-person shooters, visually stunning games, a challenge, or an homage to the past: play this game, and I promise you won’t regret it. it.promise,regret itregret it."
450,painstar,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"One of the greatest FPS games ever created. Levels are mindblowing, gameplay when you learn it is one morbid perpetuum mobile, perfect dance macabre. Platrorming is ultrasatisfying and clever, it underlines heroic adventure even more. Lore is pretty solid story for Doom and it connects every Doom game apart of Doom 3. Music is perfect just as it was in Doom 2016. Doom Eternal captures the raw thought behind franchise which was best shown by artwork for orginal Doom, as Doom Marine was descending while shooting demons below. This is ultimate power fantasy!

459,chaotikcrow,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"I haven't finished yet but this one feels more like a real DOOM game, there are a few stuff though that I am disappointed and that's the multiplayer, it is lacking stuff, I haven't been able to play battlemode because for some reason the server can't find any players, the second thing is Bethesda with their damn DRM. The good thing is the music, the gameplay, the story is quite cool and the cutscenes are very well made, I like the fact you can customize your guns and the armor of doomguy, the weapons feels more powerful and very cool looking, you can now dash, the game feels more fastpast, it is brutal, boss fights are no joke in higher difficulty, the game is hard and they don't hold back when it comes to horde of monsters, the level design is amazing but they are a bit too long for my taste but still they are fun to play. There are more platforming, at times you feel like you are playing a Mario game jumping on all kinds of obstacles, I still enjoy it but to some it can be a game breaker if they are not good at it. Anyway it is a very good game, I rate at 9 but my score might either go up or down, I played quite a bit and I believe I am in the middle of the game and I am having a blast playing on Ultra-Violence. I just hope Bethesda won't screw this up since they are the experts when it comes to that."
460,Antek,"Mar 22, 2020",8,"Insane FPS!After 20+ hours and the final battle I felt literally exhausted. The gameplay pace is insane especially on the higher difficulties. Demons slaying is super satisfying. New strategic layer demanding using different weapons against different monsters/weak points is an improvement imo.While Doom 2016 looks and feels more serious/realistic, this one is a pure entertainment!Loved it's art direction, color palette, arcade-ish approach to pick-ups and UI. If you want some true si-fi horror go (re)play Dead Space, where you are constantly haunted... In Doom Eternal they are haunted, because a Doom Slayer entered the facility!Loved both Doom 2016 & Eternal but find the latter more fun and addicting.Why 8/10? For two reasons: forced platforming/jumping often annoys, and the game is too short for the money (paid 99 eur for deluxe). More end game activities and/or progression would be appreciated. I know it sounds like a heresy to orthodox gamers, but RPG elements & loot would fit perfectly such game as Doom Eternal. That would truly make it eternal!"
461,jpeezy789,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Rip and tear, until it is done. This game is excellent and worth all of the hype. The fast paced action moments in this game are what make the game. I love using the meat-hook and swinging across the map and bursting through portals and picking off enemies as I go. The game has some strategic elements, its not just killing. It requires you to prioritize large enemies first, use weak enemies as resource fodder (for health and ammo), and NEVER stop moving. Art style is more cartoony and less gory than Doom 2016 in my opinion. The demons don't look as realistic in this game, as the game is going for a more arcade-like feel. At first it was off-putting, but then it grew on me. I imagine most will learn to like this even better. The glory kills are much, much better than Doom 2016 because of the variety of kills and the superior animations. Ammo is more scarce, the action is fast paced, the traversal is quicker, and there are far more puzzles. One of the early missions makes the game feel more like a puzzle game than an fps. Later in the game, the fps elements shine and force you to use all that the game has been giving you throughout. Never did I feel like I had to use only one certain weapon - my whole arsenal was there for me to use. Some people don't like the marauders, but they just need to git gud. The marauders give that feeling of ""OH S#*%!!!!"" and I love it.  Playing the game on pc on the Normal difficulty (Hurt Me Plenty) made the entirety of the game challenging but fun."
462,LaLaLaimeeeE,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Игра полностью оправдала все мои ожидания от неё. Динамика в бою 2016 года увеличена, добавлено больше интересных модулей на оружие, прокачка костюма, новые руны, мувменты в бою (те же палки, за которые можно хвататься и рывки), ослабление монстров (например разрушение их оружия). Вариантов убить противника стало действительно много, и теперь любой бой может выглядеть по разному и зависит только от твоей фантазии. Музыка не подкачала (хотя, скорее всего не переплюнет 2016 год). Немного неудобно было переучивать некоторые бинды по сравнению с 2016 годом, а так-же с нехватка патронов, игра заставляет тебя чаще использовать пилу, чтобы постоянно пополнять свой боезапас (и это отлично, что ты можешь пилить чаще). Абсолютно не понимаю людей, которым не понравилось добавления в игру элементов с карабканьем по стенам, прыжкам над пропастью и т.д., всё это проходилось за 1-3 попытки и являлись небольшим отдыхом перед следующем ""замесом"". Резюмируя, DOOM ETERNAL достойное продолжение серии, кандидат на игру года, и просто хороший шутан, которое не стыдно перепройти."

466,Vega23232,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"Doom eternal - лучшая игра года, потому что в ней есть много нового, чего не было в прошлых частей серии. Например определенные слабые места у противников: у пинки - хвост, у ревенанта - наплечники и т.п. Оружия теперь совсем другие. У двустволки теперь есть цепь, которая позволяет быстро приблизиться к какому-нибудь противнику, а также перелететь на другую часть местности, зацепившись за летающего какодемона или элементаля боли. Сложность. В игре почаще нужно быть в каком-то движении и полете, а также почаще собирать патроны, распилив бензопилой какого-нибудь демона (правда не всех можно распилить). Врагов на первых миссиях немало. Цвет интерфейса. В игре можно сменить цвет интерфейса, например на янтарный, если тебе допустим не нравятся разноцветные иконки. Скин палача и его оружия. В игре можно выбрать скин и оружие, только необходимо сначала эти скины открыть) В общем моя оценка этой игре: 11/10."
467,zNeverSleeping,"Mar 26, 2020",10,"Melhor jogo de 2020 até agora! Doom fez tudo que podia para evoluir. A nova mecânica é simplesmente estonteante, e nas maiores dificuldades exigirá que você use todo seu arsenal para sobreviver. O inicio do jogo é um pouco maçante no que se diz respeito a própria gameplay. Neste Doom, é necessário que você saiba usar a arma certa para o inimigo certo, e quem está acostumado com o antecessor, fica frustrado por ter de reaprender conceitos básicos - isso aconteceu comigo, e basta ver o pessoal aqui dando nota baixa tendo jogado pouco mais de uma hora.Felizmente, com o tempo você pega o jeito e a gameplay flui de uma maneira unica como em nenhum outro jogo. Alguns combos, como: lança chamas e cerra elétrica, Gancho + Cano curto e soco sangrento, Granada congelante e HE, são experiencias que te ajudam muito e vem com o passar do tempo - e muita gente não entendeu isso. Os gráficos melhoraram consideravelmente e o desempenho é super satisfatório. Pude jogar a 144hz cravados em pelo menos 90% da gameplay com o preset no Pesadelo, numa RTX 2060 + Ryzen 1600. O jogo extrai muito do hardware e isso é magnifico de se presenciar. Voltando a gameplay, o Level Design mudou em alguns aspectos. Agora temos um mapa maior, cujo exige maior exploração e habilidades de movimento. Os inimigos são inteligentes e vão te encurralar o tempo todo. As habilidades, se selecionadas da maneira correta, ajudam muito na gameplay, como a finalização a longa distancia ou slow motion quando está com 1 de vida. Alguns inimigos novos são divertidíssimos de lutar contra, como o caçador, cujo um dos pouquíssimos counters é estar a distancia certa e esperar o momento certo a atacar. A trilha sonora está magnifica e viciante. Um ótimo trabalho que deixa tudo ainda mais marcante. Quanto a historia, ela não é o foco aqui, mas nos deixa curioso quanto ao passado do Doom e sua historia, e também nos deixa muito motivados sendo que muito acreditam no mito do titan."
468,CrunchyShadow,"Mar 29, 2020",10,"Coming from someone who played DOOM and DOOM II back in the day, this game is a goddamned masterpiece. Tons of misinformation in the negative reviews which I will clear up:- Low ammo is not an issue because you have the ability to replenish ammo at *any time* using a weapon you get at the very start: the chainsaw. If you want to carry more ammo in general, you can double your reserves by putting points into the ammo stat via Sentinel Crystals. If you are out of or low on ammo, it is your own fault.- Platforming is tight, easy to understand, and an absolute blast. It controls extremely well and doesn’t even punish you with death if you fall off of a ledge. It adds a lot to your mobility that makes combat encounters far more interesting. It also prevents the game from being a one-dimensional arena shooter.- Combat does require quick reflexes and strategy. Just like in the original games, you have to keep moving. The game is extremely clear about this. If you merely pay an ounce of attention to the tutorials peppered throughout, you will quickly master the combat dance and learn which tool is right for each job. You cannot use the same 1 or 2 guns, and that’s on purpose. You couldn’t do that in the original DOOM games either so what did you expect?- Some complain that the game is too colorful. These people seemingly haven’t played the originals which were loaded with bright blues, reds, and greens. The environments are still gore-ey when they want to be, but I don’t personally see the harm in making levels distinct with more than just one single hellish theme.- There is far more of a narrative this time than in Doom 2016, but it is delightfully fascinating and makes the journey exponentially more epic. If you really really hate stories, all cutscenes are skippable.So anyways, ignore the naysayers and embrace this game. It is easily the best FPS in the last decade and you’d be sorely missing out by not playing it."

470,BonVoyage,"Apr  3, 2020",8,"Doom Eternal is the most action-packed experience you will ever get in a virtual word. Excellent mechanics, incredible graphics with one of the best optimized engines ever. 20+ hours of campaign and great replayability with community events.Having that said this Battle Mode thing is an absolute nonsense whoever thought about it and approved it must be fired. Just like a frikkin mobile game, cheap looking and functioning, super laggy, non-competitive, imbalanced mess. Ditch this 1v2 nonsense out and make it 2v2 or sth. Put an objective like defend/destroy the gore nests depend on your team. Then rotate the demons and slayers team after certain rounds. This idea is from me free for you. Also, I would much prefer an ""eons old"" classical pickup based deathmatch insted of this nonsense ugly multiplayer."

472,RIPTunaMan,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Doom 2016 but improved in almost every way and much more challenging, expanded story to connect all games in the series, even Doom64. You are the resource generator now with the chainsaw, flamethrower, and blood punch all being essential tools to survive. Most complaints I see are people who don't understand the new gameplay flow and just said ""game bad"" since it wasn't as easy to just roll through every encounter as 2016. Best level design I've seen in a game since Halo: CE. Held a solid 144+ 1080p the entire game without a single dip, running on a 2080 but have a fairly outdated CPU. Only real complaint is the Maruaders don't feel fair on higher difficulties."

Creo que Id Software y Bethesda son una de las pocas empresas que escuchan a sus fans y les da el juego glorioso como se merecen. Sin dudas supera por mucho al Doom de 2016, creci jugando doom, y morire jugando Doom. Candidato al juego del año. Sin dudas las batallas con mucho gore y heavy metal es lo mejor. Muy recomendado."
483,TheGaluMoD,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"I usually don't participate much here but I'm just flabbergasted (yes, flabbergasted) about all these negative user-reviews. I assume the score will increase in the coming days when more people who have actually spent some time with the game will chime in but still, I want to do my part. This game is an improvement over DOOM 2016 in just about every way imaginable. If you don't like a more ""videogamey"" aesthatic with bright colours for pick ups and all that, then I guess the presention isn't gonna be your cup of tea. But everything else is just so much better, if you're up for the challenge. This time you actually have to manage your ammo and pay attention to how you kill your enemies to get what you need (Health, Armor or Ammo). It seems like this is what some people take issue with and if you like your games mindless then I guess there's nothing for you here. You defintely have to think about what you're doing and stay on your toes. I remember I almost never used the chainsaw in DOOM 2016 because there was plenty of ammo to go around. In Eternal it's absolutely necessary and I end up using it in pretty much every encounter. In general you'll end up using everything at your disposal. Not because you ran out of ammo on your favourite weapon but because it's mandatory if you want to stay alive. There really is a weapon (and weapon mod) for every situation and you'll constantly be switching between them. Also the environments are very varied and look great! In DOOM 2016 everything looked pretty samey. Not here. I really can't praise this game enough but I don't want to spend all day writing this review. The main takeaway is that it's designed in a way that forces you to use everything at your disposal if you want to survive, much moreso than DOOM 2016, regardless of difficulty mode. (I'm playing on Ultra-Violence) This makes the whole experience extremely engaging. There's not a single thing I can think of that's a downgrade over its predecessor. And the only downside in general imo is that they kept the mission challenges. I'm just not a fan of these kinds of artificial challenges but I know I'm in the minority there and it's not a huge deal anyway. Just don't get the physical copy like I did. Otherwise you'll have to deal with Bethesda's awful Launcher and all the headaches that come with that. Buy it on steam. :)"
484,ReteroX,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"An almost complete evolution of Doom 2016; this is the fastest, most furious shooter that I have ever played and it's not all reflexes and quick-scoping.There's a method to the madness here that rewards intelligence, but it's not for the faint of heart.There's even a story and extra lore to find if you care, and the writing is gloriously cheesy.This is perhaps the most violent game ever created, if not for the horrible wounds you will inflict upon your hapless foes, then it is the frightening intensity of their occurrence.There's platforming and exploration too, and this feels not unlike the more serene Metroid Prime; mostly due to the platforms and the viewpoint. While the platforming occasionally has some issues, Eternal would feel a lot more empty without it. There are some cutscenses that take the Zelda approach, wrestling the camera from you after combat to show you where to go next, which can be a little jarring, but they serve a purpose as the environments tend to have a few more paths and it can be easy to get lost in a new location after a tense battle.Some of the puzzles are a little frustrating, but they work well enough and some are actually pretty clever.Overall, I think Eternal is definitely a step up from the previous title, but it won't be for everyone; especially those who prefer a more spartan gameplay loop."
485,Deaflat,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"This game is a masterpiece. The graphics are jaw dropping, the combat is incredible and addicting as hell. You can't go into this expecting to directly transfer your Doom 2016 strategies. The weapons, demons, and resource management makes it significantly different. You need to get used to how the weapons function against various enemies and situations. They aren't the same. There are people complaining about the ammo situation. They aren't getting it. Resource management is a core part of the combat game loop now. We have known that for over a year. These people weren't paying attention to all the information that id put out there. They made it very clear. No one should be surprised by this. For example, in 2016 the chainsaw was an ""oh ****"" button that you pulled out when you ran out of ammo unexpectedly or if you needed the insta-kill. In Doom Eternal it is integral to the combat. Glory kills, flame belch, and chainsaw are all now equally important in the heat of battle as the actual weapons are. Ammo, health and armor packs throughout a level are sparse compared to 2016. You need to get the bulk of your resources from the enemies. Incorporate it into your combat play style just like you do when choosing the right weapon at the right time in the middle of combat. It's just another tool in the Doom combat tool chest. Also, for those complaining about the colors; The game isn't colorful the way it is because they wanted ""oooh, shiny"". It is there because they have a tsunami of information to communicate to you when all hell is breaking loose (pun intended). If you don't like the HUD colors, you can change the colors in the settings to either a different palette, or make it all a single color. Pretty ironic with all the people **** about the colors when back in the day, it was often joked that id Software games were nothing but brown. People gotta complain about something I guess"

The people who give this game negative reviews have no actual arguments. I've seen reviews complaining about arenas. This game is an arena shooter. I have no idea why you are complaining about arenas in an arena shooter. Then, there's the people who are just bad at the game, complaining about difficulty (while playing on Ultra-Violence or Nightmare), the people complaining about the low amount of ammo but not using their chainsaw, and the people complaining about the platforming. Now, the ones complaining about the platforming don't realize that the game needs something in between the arenas. You can't just have empty areas in between them, or just arena after arena after arena, with nothing in between. Personally, I found them really fun. Anyway, my point is, the people who complain about this game really have no point or arguments that make sense or can't be fixed by altering their own game-play. DOOM Eternal has given me hope for the future of gaming."

492,randomPlayer42,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"If you liked DOOM2016 (or any shooter for that matter) you should try it. In my opinion this is the most complete arcade shooter ever and delivers a challenging and engaging experience with extremely good graphics. 10/10 must play.Tipp: if it's your first DOOM you might wanna play on the first 2 difficulties for the first run, because oh boi it can be really hard on the higher ones."

Все эти 4 года пока мы ее жди, все они окупились сполна. Я надеюсь что игры будет успешной и вы сможете и дальше радовать нас такими играми. От себя скажу что игра по хорошему проста и гениальна. Рекомендую к покупке, особенно если знать что сейчас твориться в мире. Лучше сидеть дома и весь ваш карантин потратить на эту игру."
497,Hydraforlife,"Mar 20, 2020",9,It's like doom 2016 but with a hub world. The main difference would have to be the large amount of jumping from place to place. The upgrade system and way you find weapons is very similar to doom 2016. It rewards you for exploring with secrets hidden all across the map and overall one of my favorite games so far in 2020
498,Soulweeper,"Mar 20, 2020",9,"So i am a huge fan of DOOM 2016 and the old titles. This is a wet dream for veteran DOOM player. Visually it goes more for an arcade style mixed with modern graphics, but it works in context of the game that it is. It doesn't take itself too serious like the old games, while giving some great lore. Combat feels great, DOOM 2016 had the ""issue"" that you could run it with one weapon only with the more limited ammo count and the enemy diversity this is not as viable anymore and at least for me thats a good thing. Platforming feels good and works quite well as a little cool down after some fights. The only real problem i have is that damn purple goo it limits your mobility to such a degree that if you manage to get yourself cornered you can do nothing about it and well some lava would have done it to in certain combat scenarios. Overall it is a great game and a contender for GOTY."
499,Gaisericus,"Mar 21, 2020",10,Perfect. Even better than 2016. A lot of the players don't understand the new mechanics and how to switch weapons and are getting mad about the ammo changes. These people are literally mad because bad and it's kind of funny and sad. A lot of them only played a couple of hours and didn't play the game with the full kit. This game shows us how many mechanics we can put into an FPS and I absolutely love it. It's a good kind of complexity that rewards good players.
500,ArchieWilde,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"Naturally the graphics are what they are, but the gameplay is spot on constantly. Also, you can play a few minutes or hours at a time depending on the situation. Colour scheme changes between areas, there's enough hidden stuff and all that. It has no real weak point and everything it does is done amazingly well."
501,anihavoc,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"All these negative reviews basically just want a Doom 2016 Clone which took little skill and had very little diversity in level and fight design, if people prefer a more simple minded game that can't appreciate changes that make the game a funner and better challenge rather then pewpewing with the same gun the whole game then grab that one. Doom Eternal is a breath of Fresh air to the franchise and while some smaller areas could use some work in order to get around a bit better i'd say over all this is far more adrenaline inducing and down right badass compared to the earlier iteration in the franchise. The weapon design is stellar as well as the sound design for the weapons. I'd have to say of my 27 years of PC gaming this is by far, the most intense, brutal, first person shooter I've ever played. The gunplay is TIERS above anything else available in the market. Also the story is great, for these people who said the story is bad.. they obviously didn't bother reading any of the codex as there is a lot of tie in to whats going on in those entries. Can't please everyone, but I most definitely recommend everyone giving this a try if you like fast paced, truely challenging and engaging gameplay with an absolutely breath taking set of visuals that sweep across countless different biomes and environments.Played - Nightmare Difficulty on a LG C9 OLED in HDR @4K 60FPS on a High End gaming rig and 3000$ headphone + amp/dac setup."
502,MrPato,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Simply amazing, best FPS I have ever played in years.Idk how but they managed to put a interesting story in DOOM, not to mention all the codex intros you get if you want to go deeper into the DOOM lore, and it's a pretty interesting one I gotta say. The gameplay stays similar to DOOM 2016 but it's improved, you now have a lot of other options to Rip and Tear, with the Grenade Launcher, The Ice Bomb, Flamethrower, The Crucible, Dashing also makes the gameplay way more energetic and fast paced. Graphics are Outstanding, weapons have been re-made and all of them look better then in 2016 in my opinion, specially the Plasma Rifle, god I love that. The background area In some missions is simply out of this world, just look around on the very first mission "" Hell on Earth "" Battlemode is ok, I'm afraid it might die in the future tho just like DOOM 2016 Deathmatch. My only complain is that there is some unnecessary platforming that can be really annoying specially for a DOOM game. ( Of course people are going to downvote this review because they cant take different opinions )"

511,nvsammy,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"I've never written a game review before in my entire life.  This game deserves a 10/10, without question.It is everything i loved growing up in the 90s.  It's a combination of Doom, Quake, 90s action movies, and saturday morning cartoons.  All of this is performed to the best heavy metal sound track that has ever been composed. Put shortly, this is one of the best entertainment experiences I've ever had in my life."
512,saber_rider,"Mar 20, 2020",8,"PROS: - Best soundquality i have seen in a game for a while - The story is suprisingly well made - Animations look almost perfect. - A lot of secrets and bonus areas to find in the world - There is a high variety of well made enemies which all have their own behaviour and weakpoints - Finding skins ingame instead of buing them as overpriced microtransactions in the year 2020 whut? - Many new abilities and dank gadgets like shotgun-grappling hook, shoulder mounted grenade launcher, monkeybars, dash refill item, weaponmodifications and runes to upgrade your passive stats, which really enrich the gameplay and make the pacing a lot faster. CONS: Most bossfights are boring: Selfexplanetory. There are a few good ones, but most of them are just way to easy and really not worth your time. Nothing compared to the epic hour long raid bosses in destiny 2. I know its kind of hard to make good boss fights in a single player first person shooter. It's not as easy as in third person games like the souls games, where you can better judge the distance of attacks. But still they could have made them at least a little bit longer and more challenging. To many tutorial levels at the beginning of the game: The first 3 levels feel completely like tutorial levels, with a pacing very different to the rest of the game.Having one tutorial level is ok, but three after each other is kind of overkill. The real game begins at the 4th level. You can't find your own playstyle: You have to play the game 100 % as from the devs intended. It's completely build around the glory kill and chainsaw take town mechanics. Because that's how you get most of your health and ammo back. If you don't like getting locked into takedown animations which you have to perform over and over again, 100th of times during the game, then you are out of luck. Many normal weapons feel super weak, because they aren't supposed to kill the enemy demons, they are supposed to put them into a staggering state out of which you can then either chainsaw them for gaining ammo or glory kill them for gaining health. Other shooter are 100% about aiming skill and quickscoping enemies with headshots. This game is rather 25% quickscoping weak points of enemies so that they lose their mounted weaponry and get less dangerous, 25 % prioritizing which enemy to quickscope next while a horde of smaller enemies is chasing after you, 25 % resource and cooldown management and 25 % performing glory kills and chainsaw moves. They have build this whole resource and cooldown management minigame which you have to play and respect or you run out of ammo and health very quickly.This system can be very fun and rewarding, but only if you have no issue with doing the same takedown animations over and over for the entire game. So if you really love finishing enemies off with headshots, then this is for sure not the right game for you. You can headshot the weaker demons with mostly 1 of the 2 sniper rifles in game, but they don't even give you a rewarding headshot sounds for that. And all the other demons are just way to tanky and even if you manage to shoot them into their staggering state, even then you can't finish them off with headshots, because they seem to have some super armor or invincibility frames during their staggering phase, because the game really really wants you to finish them mostly with the takedowns and nothing else. I understand what they are trying to do with it and for the most part it pays of, but i really would have wished, they would at least have given you the option to either glory kill or headshot the demons for ammo during their stagger phase. So that the people who do not like doing so many takedown animations would have had an option. Yes you can speed the animations up a little bit by equipping some rune which boosts your takedown speed, but even then the chainsaw animations still takes forever. CONCLUTION: The game is a solid 8/10 but could have been easily a 9/10 if they would have given you an option to play without that heavy use of takedown animations in a shooter and made the bosses more dank. But still a very good game which is made with a lot of love and a good eye for detail and a desire for gameplay refinement. Publisher plz hire more devs like those here."
513,StDenis,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"Beautiful game design, very comfortable controls despite height fight intensity and enemies density. Artwork just like sound design - a masterpiece. Game of the year is here, I believe!"
514,Young_Nacho,"Mar 23, 2020",10,"Most of the people complaining, honestly just suck at the game and refused to learn how to do anything. Giving this game less than a 9 should grant you an instant trip to behind the shed where a shotgun can blow your head off."
515,IoloBurris,"Mar 21, 2020",10,"If you think about the gameplay, and the ratio between simplicity and enjoyment, it's truly a phenomenal accomplishment."
516,Trypsinogen,"Apr 21, 2020",9,"The game took some getting used to and was frustrating at times in the beginning for me, but once I got the hang of it, it was fantastic. You may see people complaining about there not being enough ammo. This can be remedied in large part by remembering your DOOM-slaying ABCs - ALWAYS BE CHAINSAWING. Chainsawing refills ammo and as long as you remember to chainsaw fodder demons regularly it's fine. It would be better though I think if the chainsaw animation was faster. I also found that I also needed time to get used to the platforming and using the map, maybe that's because this is my first DOOM game, though. Graphics and performance are solid, which is great. A lot of triple A games being released that run like **** but not this one. Story is serviceable and I found myself spending a lot of time reading the lore entries. Music is also great overall.  Environments and map layouts are diverse and fairly intricate. Enemy types are interesting as well. The interplay between the arsenal and the weaknesses and strengths of the different enemy types works well. When you know how the system works and things are flowing, it can be a very fun experience. I personally feel like I would've appreciated it being even faster and more over-the-top than it already is in terms of just being a demon-slaying badass, but it does a good job as is."

522,maku,"Sep  3, 2020",10,"This game feels like a fantastic evolution of Doom 2016 although it demands way more from the player than the previous game. To me this is an absolute masterpiece, probably best shooter ever. Beat the game on nightmare about 5 times at this point, can't wait for the DLC and more master levels."
523,tommeysalami,"Mar 20, 2020",8,"First of all, let me say that this is a great game for a fast paced adrenaline shooter. You'll find many people crying that they didn't just copy and paste DOOM 2016 to this game. If you want the that version, go play that version. These are the same people who buy FIFA every year. With the new installment, they try to innovate where they can and make the game fast paced by limiting ammo and encouraging glory kills and the use of equipment. The platforming segments are easy and short (10 seconds of jumping) and people who complain about it probably couldn't finish world 1 on mario. It's crazy to see a good developer trying to make their game better than the last installment get criticized for making the game different. It's fun, the music is outstanding, the gunplay is smooth and great. The campaign is almost doubled in length and the graphics look good. Ammo is limited but the developers understand that and added many ways of increasing capacity and ways to get more ammo. I guess some people dont like chainsawing demons. Anyways, its a fantastic sequel filled with fun, adrenaline fueled moments. People who rate this negatively are just upset because the game didn't cater to their wants specifically instead of what the community wanted."
524,AngryShark92,"May 27, 2020",9,"May 27th, 2020 - Revised to a 9/10, as Denuvo Anti-Cheat Software has been removed in PC Patch 1.1. Well done Marty, and the rest of the id team for listening to the community. Hoping for smooth sailing from here on out. May 15th, 2020 - Updated to a 0/10, you cannot add Denuvo Anti-Cheat software that has kernel-level access in a May patch when it did not exist in the original March 20 EULA, it is a breach of trust and should be considered illegal. I advise anyone on PC to steer clear of this game until this Denuvo Anti-Cheat software is removed. This software does not belong in a mostly single player experience. TLDR Points: + Gorgeous world design+ Great difficulty balancing+ Decent story with lots of lore+ Superb in-game soundtrack+ New demons are a lot of fun+ Excellent gunplay+ Incentivized exploration+ Incredibly well-optimized performance+ Listens to community feedback - Occasional crashes and bugs- Platforming gets annoying after multiple playthroughs- Melee attack rendered useless due to blood punch mechanic- Requires Bethesda Launcher- Soundtrack launch mess is disappointing- Twitch/Amazon Prime drops isolate parts of the community- Arcade-ish design is a bit of a step down from Doom 2016- A few glory kill and unique death animations have been cut from the game Doom Eternal is an FPS experience unlike any other, and is quite the gem considering the state of the gaming industry at the moment. Fast-paced, smooth-running, run & gun/rip & tear gameplay that is an adrenaline pumping masterpiece that will fuel any power fantasy, and with an absolutely glorious soundtrack accompanying it, Doom Eternal is one HELL of a complete FPS package. I have to point out the aesthetically pleasing environmental design by the team at id software, it is an absolute treat to experience all the different areas of the game and the amount of detail that went into them. It is also worth mentioning that the team is also capable of listening to fan backlash and admitting where they went wrong and fixing it without condemning the community, there truly aren't many companies left that would do this for their games. As for negatives, some of the levels (looking at you Urdak) have an unnecessary abundance of platforming puzzles, the game has BSOD/crashed on me a few times and can cause corrupted save files, Twitch Prime drops are deeply disguised micro-transactions, and the colours of the pickups are starting to make me feel like this game is less serious than its predecessor. Overall, Doom Eternal is an absolute treat for FPS fans, and alongside its own predecessor, its one of the few good FPS games that have been released in the past decade, it is an incredible experience that I would recommend to any FPS fan. It is a 9/10 for me, the only major downside being the bugs and crashes that can occur and ruin Ultra-Nightmare runs, hopefully there will be a fix for this in the future. P.S. Thanks for removing Denuvo!!!"
525,genesis518,"Mar 22, 2020",9,"PLEASE ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN. I feel like a lot of people either misunderstand this game or had unrealistic expectations. I found the game well balanced and intriguing. Doom Eternal expands on Doom 2016 in gameplay and story and does so in a way that adds new depth to the saga and ties in the history of the entire franchise very well.There is more map navigation, which was certainly in its predecessor, but the incorporation of climbing and the use of the dash was a smooth yet challenging new way to give the levels a sense of greater scale, whereas in Doom 2016 the use of double jumping and climbing onto ledges kept the game maps tighter. This may have been the best choices for both games given their respective settings.The combat has been tweaked in such a way that it almost forces a player to use there entire arsenal, rather than just a few favorite weapons. This is done by giving the enemies weak point that can best be exploited by certain weapons with certain modifications. And the use of melee is a must in order to preserve ammo for when it is needed. No longer is the relentless ""spray and pray"" type of gameplay rewarded as much as it was in Doom 2016.With the evolved combat system and map navigation Doom Eternal requires more critical thinking that Doom 2016, which may tend to annoy some players.  I can understand that. In the beginning I noticed that my style of play that I used for Doom 2016 didn't really work, and it continuously forced me to adapt.If I have to be critical I would say that the story, as it gradually unfolds, only really starts to make sense after the half way point. Until then I found myself asking, ""Why am I here and doing all of this again? Why am I going after these hell priests? Where is all of this going? The developers seemed to make the story a bit more convoluted by trying to tie the game in with the original pc games of the 90s and Doom 64. I think the franchise would have been better off treating Doom 2016 as a completely fresh reboot, whereas Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal function as a reboot in graphics and gameplay only mirroring Doom and Doom 2, so it makes the whole thing seem a bit strange. Since they are both a reboot and sequels at the same time.Still, I just played the whole thing from start to finish and had a lot of fun. Which is ultimately the primary goal of any game."
526,Shinod,"Mar 21, 2020",9,"This game gives you and absolute adrenaline burst, gameplay is frenetic, fast and even more visceral than previous DOOM, there are changes on how you progress through the game that reminds me more to the Shadow Warrior remake back in 2013 (which was superb) than any other game of the DOOM franchise, for some people is bad for me is fine. There a plenty of upgrades you can do, very similar to DOOM 2016 but with some minor additions. This game is a blast and totally worth it if you like blood, gore, fast paced shooting and to be out of ammo 45% of your time."
527,Ahoj,"Mar 20, 2020",10,Game of the year!!! I dont know why so many people dont like the game. It is super fresh etc. 10/10!
528,vert343,"Mar 20, 2020",10,"Let me put it this way, DOOM Eternal takes DOOM 1993 and turns it into a modern, complete experience that is absolutely worth playing. It's quite arcadey but very fun and the combat is INTENSE. Some people complain about the cut-scenes getting in the way of the gameplay but they can all be skipped so its a moot point. It's also brutally difficult. DOOM 2016 on Ultra Violence was pretty standard difficulty, while I kinda struggled on Ultra Violence this time around. To me this justifies the arcadey elements like the extra lives. Hell, if you renamed the extra lives ""Death Shields"" then nobody would complain because thats what they really are. You would die, you get your health bar reset and a few seconds in invincibility to get away from whatever was trying to kill you then its business as usual. Some of the enemy types *can* be annoying but most can be dealt with in various ways and the Super Shotgun is the ultimate multi-tool in this game as it can be effectively used on just about any demon while other weapons can be a little more specialized. Game feels great to play with visceral, unrelenting action and weapons that feel like I'm firing a mid-sized SUV out of a handheld cannon whenever I fire them. Some demons can be a bit tanky, by design or otherwise, but you usually have weapons to counter those demons before they show up. Also, the chainsaw is your best friend."
529,Anikrage,"Mar 22, 2020",10,"Doom Eternal summarised in 1 word is perfection. The game is superbly optimized allowing even the players with lower end systems as me have an equally enjoyable time. I played it on 1050ti and i5 with 8gigs of RAM and the game ran smooth and flawlessly without any compromise in visual quality. The gameplay is an improvement over the 2016 soft reboot and sets an benchmark for all fps henceforth. The game effectively hands the player a wide range in arsenal which the player must skillfully execute to create a perfect blend of movement and shooting, the Doom dance. Overall the game is perhaps one of the best fps shooters ever made and the lads at Id software did a phenomenal job at it. The game just kicks ass, left and right. it is not for the faint hearted nor for the people who play at easy difficulty levels. Play it at nightmare or above for the ultimate doom experience. The game is the best Fps and thats a fact!"

535,tdebug,"Apr 24, 2021",0,"Childish boomstick. Kinda entertaining at first, but becoming repetitive rather fast. Everything what we hate is there, respawning enemies, checkpoint saves, enemies fighting to each other as a decoration as they never actually kill each other.Platform jumping in the game deserve a special notice - extremely annoying and stupid part.Special kills is a routine, as you need to finish almost every enemy with it to get a ""prize"" - ammo, which is btw very limited. Honestly, I will try to get a moneyback."
536,NLA1997,"Mar 24, 2020",9,"Good game. Not as good as DOOM2016 for objective reasons such as:- Bad pacing, no need for platforming or the focus on story, focus should be on combat.- The need to constantly find ammo or lesser devils to refill ammo is horrible and ruins the combat experience.- Should've kept the DOOM2016 graphics and artistic features.-etc."
537,Erunamo,"Mar 20, 2020",6,"There is some good and bad in this story... Good: The game runs extremely good.Some weapons feel great.The combat has a crazy pace of the old Quake and Unreal Tournament games. Bad: The story seems a little off, as if it should not be shoved in your throat so much, Doom 2016 did this much better.You are forced to use the weapons THEY want, not the ones you do.The ammo economy is painful, boring and annoying. You basically always run out of ammo for multiple weapons, resulting in you having to use the chainsaw or using some stuff you dont like to use.The platforming is just too much... it is great to have mobility and to sometimes have to reach something. But the double jump, double dash into a dash recharge and another double dash into swinging on a bar and then catch on a wall is simply not something you enjoy, let alone want in a DOOM game... I am not really happy with my purchase, I wanted to support the devs by buying for the full price, but I should not have. The team clearly did not know what they wanted to create, so they made something you sorta enjoy sometimes, but lots of other times you just roll your eyes with a ""oh god, not this again..."""
538,Bishy,"Jun  2, 2020",3,"I have about 2 hours in Doom Eternal now. I've been looking forward to this quite a bit since I played Doom 2016. However, this game feels like just another shooter with a bunch of modern gaming BS thrown in - skins, gimmicks, fluff, etc. Start with the sound track - I think I haven't heard barely any decent music in the 2 hours that I've played so far. It hasn't ramped up once into the great metal soundtrack that is supposed to come with it like Doom 2016 did. Next with the combat - it's functional. Doesn't feel as brutal as Doom 2016 was, but at least it works... until they put you in the purple goo that makes you move at a crawl, unable to jump, unable to dash (or boost or whatever), and fight tanky enemies... because for some reason, I want my mobility to be taken away in a doom game. Then some of the areas are incredibly cramped - both the arenas and transition areas. Who's idiotic idea was it to put me into a hallway with one of those spider demons with no room to move before I even had the boost function? Who's idiotic idea was it to take away my mobility so drastically in multiple parts of the game? It feels like I'm just grinding out from one area to the next. Add on the fact that there are now jumping puzzles. I play doom to fight, not to figure out how to jump around some falling platforms. There's a lot of this style of gameplay now - it's fluff. They're not fun, they're not challenging, they're not mentally stimulating, they just waste time. And then we get into the pacing. Doom 2016 didn't have a ton of lore/story in it which was fine for me. It would be fine with it too... if the cut scenes didn't cut into the combat and slow down the pace considerably. And the doom guy doesn't even seem angry any more. He just seems apathetic and doesn't want to listen to anyone. Doesn't do a ton of random smashing of anything unless it's a glory kill. Add in the puzzles from before and the pace slows down even more. Then also add in the fact that they actually encourage cheesing in multiple parts - sniping from a distance instead of the close up fast pace combat from Doom. I just... what? And then I'm really nitpicking here, but the textures, colors, and design used is just kind of arcade-ish and looks like a cartoon. This is not a doom game. I can still go back to Doom 2016 and get absolutely lost in the battle/chaos. In this, I feel more like I'm checking off lists and such like so many modern ""shooters"" feel. The brutality is gone, the fast paced combat is mostly gone and just replaced with frustration and cramped environments, it's just not good. I gave it 3/10 just for being functional. Other than that, I wish I hadn't spent 60$ on this. In addition, I forgot the greatest sin in this game. It requires a bethesda account to play, even though it's a single player game and the actual online portion of the game is heinously unbalanced and terrible to play."

541,TwoEars,"Mar 23, 2020",7,"For me a step back compared to Doom 2016. * Limited ammo, chainsaw gets boring and repetitive* Cutscene story interrupts* We're supposed to take the story seriously now, but it's trash* Story connects badly with Doom 2016* Doom Slayer speaks in flashbacks, serious misstep imho* Soundtrack much less hard hitting, few memorable songs* Too many jumping puzzles* Atmosphere is somehow less intimidating than Doom 2016 and more cartoony* No pistol* Many weapons lack punch compared to Doom 2016* Can't even melee some of the basic enemies to death, Doom Slayer feels weak* Some enemies are bullet sponges* Too much focus on playing ""the right way"" with tactical play and enemy weak points etc.* All guns in the game are revealed right away, no sense of discovery* UI is pretty bad and intrusive* Level design is overall worse Doom Eternal fundamentally misunderstands what made Doom 2016 so enjoyable for many; sometimes you just want to use the super shotgun, kill demons, feel powerful and listen to heavy metal. And Doom 2016 was also great because, while it did have good and interesting lore, it also laughed in the face of its own story. But with Doom Eternal we're suddenly supposed to care about the story. The setting and atmosphere is also much less intimidating, in Doom 2016 we saw the remains of a Titan and were told of the epic battle which ensued between the Doom Slayer and the Titan. This was a big deal and we wondered how the hell the Doom Slayer managed to defeat such a beast. In Doom Eternal everything is much less mysterious and intimidating, great beasts like the Titans are just casually walking around. For me about the only thing better with Doom Eternal, compared to Doom 2016, is the new graphics engine."

Most of time you doing two things - jumping and ripping demons with hands or chainsaw, because you always out of ammo or health. This game designed as number of quicktime events, connected with stupid platforming - jump after jump after jump e t.c. Wow effect for youtube videos, but it's plays not as good as it looks! And they absolutely killed all atmosphere of original Doom series! Hey fat taco, it's isn't CARTOONISH VIOLENCE! Because it never was! It's post-truth of Bethesda marketing department and you KNOW it. This game is just pain in the ass, it's how it plays, without any balance and anything interesting if you playing on lesser difficulty than Ultra-Violence. It has no place for unique tactics or something, just quicktime events and jumps, because game is teleporting demons right in your face! For fans of Osu and other jerk off games, they absolutely ruined it. Exploring? Nooo! Jump by platforms and play goddamn arcade **** when shooting and close combat is 50/50. It's Doom? It's revolution of FPS genre?! Are you fkn serious?! Formula is simple - weaker Doomslayer, less ammo, more attachments and more HP to monsters! Doom '16 has a popular Arcade Mode - Doom Eternal is arcade mode only. ""Geniously""! I hate how this guys declined everything from classic Doom games.

Jumping puzzles are a pain in the ass, it's no fun at all having to run across half the map to retry the jump only to fall down again (as there is no saveload for some reason). The combat is ok, but somehow feels downgraded from the 2016. The purple goo where you can't jump is another dumb idea in this game.

But no. - I don't need MMORPG-like cartoonish design.- I don't need infinitely respawning monsters.- I don't want you to limit my ammo this much, only to force me to use specific gameplay features.- I don't want to see those rainbow fountains of ammo all the time.- I don't need whole game consisting only of arena-like levels.- I don't need you to tell me which weapon is right to use.- I don't need tons of abilities with cooldowns in a shooter.- I don't need big shiny question marks on secrets and arcade-styled powerups.- I don't need this much platforming.- I don't want this weird way of storytelling. I simply don't get why we couldn't keep the formula of Doom 2016, where it was so satisfying to crush monsters' sculls. Where is it all gone? And where is all this storyline coming from? Why do we need this generic fantasy nonsense in a Doom game, what is it, Harry Potter fanfiction? And also why do I need to watch monsters fighting each other without taking any actual damage? Is it supposed to be funny? Thanks, but no, refund, I will rather play any other Doom game. This one is not just a bad Doom game, this is not even a shooter. This is First Person Mario-Dota-Slasher, a new kind of genre, which I defenitely do NOT like. And it is a shame they spoiled great Doom series with this awful game. PS. What those positive reviewers are even talking about - ""resource management"", ""strategic thinking""? How about this strategy - ""press E for ammo, press C for health"", does it sound smart to you? Resource management existed in classic Doom games where you had actually to learn level to find hidden ammo, or otherwise you would just die, because there was no infinite farming. Modern mass-market ""gamers"" would just cry, I believe, so here you have doom eternal."

548,Masterhummel,"Mar 21, 2020",7,"It's alright, but i can't really warm up to it. It's very, very arcady. Some people might like that tho. The world design is great but neither the character nor items or consumables seem to fit in. Pickups are either super-bright, colored like candy or bob up and down while violently flashing. It might not sound severe but it is really irritating. Like... the chainsaw you rip out of a guys body in Doom 2016, or the rifle you tear from a dead soldies arms. In Doom 2020 they just hover on the ground in the dedicated weapon room at some point in the level, flashing wildly. This diconnect carries over into the sound design and animations. For one it's really strong and snappy but now and then you have this comical sounds - like when some headshots or ripping out a cacodemons eye will make an audible 'pop' sound that could come straight out of a kids tv show. It might sound super-petty but imagine listening to a metal opera and every now and then the lead goes 'hyuck-hyuck' like Goofy. Gameplay wise it's good with even more emphasis on movement and a lot more enemies to fight and manage. The pistole is now gone which ... i can understand, but the replacement is that you now always have 1 fuel for the chainsaw with which to kill lesser enemies. The resulting candy explosion is your main way of regenerating ammo. And that's something that does not work for me. When i fight a big demon it's just tideous to turn around and look for one of the endlessly spawning minor zombies so i can get some ammo back. By now every now and then when it happens i roll my eyes with a sigh. Doomguy itself started bulking and went from just an angry guy who had enough of this **** to stereotypic antihero with a heart of gold, that constantly gets told by everyone how awesome they are. They really go out of the way with pampering the player.  Not my favorite design choice. All that said, it's still a good shooter. It's still an id shooter and they managed to get some fun new gameplay mechanics that act as modifiers on the existing combat. If everything of my complaints sounded like minor issues, you might want to give it a try."

Main way to get ammo/health- Melee does no damage, unless enemies are staggered- Forced to use chainsaw constantly- Super annoying platforming, instead ditching it (already bad in 2016) they put it on steroids- More linear maps than 2016- Ugly menus and HUD. No matter how much you change colors. Disabling it gimps your gameplay- Worst of all, the hideous red LOW AMMO bar, blocking your view (you'll see lot of that)- The font used everywhere makes Comic Sans look good- Literally, the UI designer must be blind or retarded or both- Confusing, nonsensical story nobody cares about.. constant cutscenes break the action- Doom guy isn't as brutal anymore, he calmly listens to the idiotic speeches the NPCs give- No pickup animation for guns, instead collect ugly floating neon icons -> teleport to tutorial- You're forced to use all guns, by being out of ammo constantly --> time for chainsaw- Ugly garish rainbow colored pickups pouring out of enemies- Guns are ugly 90's style floating pickups now, instead of grounded look of 2016- Graphics not really that impressive, art style is cartoony compared to 2016. Technically maybe better graphics, artistically NOT better- Music is good, but not as good as 2016, Mick Gordon going through motions, nearly all of the riffs suck compared to 2016 Avoid and save 60€.

553,Avadon,"Mar 20, 2020",3,"Incredibly disappointing sequel. Combat pacing feels mangled as you have to constantly glory kill and chainsaw kill due to the low ammo capacity. It's no longer a fun way to replenish the ammo of your favourite weapon because you overused it a bit in the last arena, no, you have to constantly do it to stay alive. The aesthetic also feels way off. The UI is horrendous in many different ways, and the graphics frequently look washed out and cartoony. I also really hate the enemy weakness system they have in place. Certain enemies are weak to a specific weapon, or rather weapon upgrade, if used in a specific way. Unfortunately this doesn't give you a minor advantage, it turns them into bullet sponges if you don't kill them exactly the way the game wants you to. This is not how Doom should work. Enemies should be weak to the way you move, not the weapon upgrade that you use. In this case, instead of keeping your rhythm up, the game forces you to just fiddle with your weapon selection ALL the time. Add to the above an abundance of tedious platforming and the facepalm-worthy excuse for a ""story"" and you get a very mediocre, frequently annoying shooter that scores even lower due to the shoes it has to fill. Skip it."
554,Krieger4,"Mar 21, 2020",2,"DOOM 2016 was a coherent game where every gameplay element existed to keep you immersed, keep you in the action, keep you going. You'd kill dozens if not hundreds of demons before realizing what happened but the adrenaline was pumping, the music kept you on the edge, and you'd know you caught a break when the music finally slowed down. Only then could you take a moment to realize what's around you before moving the only way you could: forward, where more action awaited. DOOM 2016 knew what they were doing and why, there's even a GDC talk about it, available online called ""Embracing Push Forward Combat in DOOM"". DOOM Eternal took those gameplay elements and turned them completely around. Instead of filling you with ammo you were low on, it restricts ammo acquisition through the chainsaw, which is on a ****ing cooldown. Instead of rushing forward in the action and feeling like a god amongst demons, you're forced to hide behind pillars while the cooldown comes back so you can start fighting again. - They removed ammo drop from takedowns, which used to refill ammo you were critically low on- They removed the pistol with infinite ammo so you can cause staggers, deal takedowns and get more ammo- Melee does no damage, or no significant damage, so you can't cause stagger with that either- They put the chainsaw on a ****ing cooldown In the mid 2000 the video game industry realized that, while health regen was nice for the player, it caused one big issue: players would now spend half their time hiding while the action was supposed to be going on. Since then, a lot of mechanics were put in place to stay player friendly, but not kill the action. Such as splitting the health bar in 3 so that you would never gain more than 1/3 of your health, reducing how much time someone spends hiding. I guess DOOM:Eternal game designers didn't get that memo. I'm pissed. I wanted DOOM 2016 improved. I wanted a few cool things to do, but really, I wanted more of the same. What I got is a disgrace. On the upside, the visuals are nice and the music is still pretty good. On the downside, I didn't even talk about the invisible walls everywhere because they couldn't do level design where their platforming would work without also opening up a bunch of potential ways to go around the intended path, so instead they patched everything with invisible walls."
555,Nerves82,"Mar 20, 2020",3,I am so disappointed by this game. It is dull. All the sharpness that was introduced in 2016 is just lacking here. I have no interested in playing a shooter where you are note given ammo to shot with. Everything about this game is just lame.
556,OzoneTheGreat,"Mar 20, 2020",3,"Fails to capture the experience that made the first game so great. It's trying way to hard to expand on a game that has no room for expansion. Doom is not an open world game, it's not a deep story that requires lore.The previous game had a great, self contained story that complimented the actual game. I loved it because it because of its simplicity and focus on making fighting seem like a dance without crutching on gimmicky crap and more importantly without having some kind of lore. It's trying to be more than it is, which is sad. Not to mention the graphical fidelity is far lower than expected, most likely because they tried to make it huge and open instead of the closed arena style combat I loved so much about the first one."
557,meisobear,"Mar 22, 2020",1,"This game was such a disappointment. I picked up Doom 2016 in a sale after hearing repeated good things about it - I thought I didn't have much to lose. I was positively surprised the entire time through and keep going to play it. I've 6+ hours in Doom Eternal so far and... it's just so boring. You don't play Doom for the story as such, but Doom 2016's story was paced perfectly to build tension and the ominous atmosphere. Doom Eternal's story has made me cringe repeatedly. They've taken Doom and turned it into a weird satanic cartoon. So, ok, let's ignore the story and get to the action. Despite overhauling the weaponry so you can now set demons on fire and chainsaw more frequently, it's somehow less visceral. The chainsaw in Doom 2016 was a great tool you had to deploy tactically for great pay off. Eternal's is just another process you have to go through from time to time; it's necessary work, not a fun reward. Just avoid this game and play 2016."

562,PswayZ,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"It's a decent game but it didn't feel like DOOM 2016. The combat felt like they really dialed it back for consoles. Even though Doomguy is faster (in theory?) It really slugs along. The biggest goof so far seems to be the ammo. There just isn't any ammo. No ammo, it becomes all run, and no gun. Having to chainsaw every minute and have no good melee mechanic (or pistol!) really sucks. If you run out of ammo, and there is a strong demon you can't chainsaw, that means it's time to start over. Which ruins the already slowed down shooting. So it goes from slower, to stopped. And don't get me wrong DOOM 2016 had it's issues with some checkpoints but it never felt like a chore to play. It felt like a challenge. The other issue immediately is the problem with the tutorials constantly popping up and cutscenes. This is DOOM not Metal Gear Solid. There is NO TIME TO BLEED. LESS STORY MORE SHOOTING. Demons are invading Earth. That's all we need to know. Doomguy doesn't have a single purpose except to kill monsters. I don't need to know anything else. Sure cutscenes are skippable but it feels weird having them at all. I was two hours in and I was STILL getting tutorials. IN DOOM. It might be some kid's first FPS but it sure as hell was obnoxious to be taught how to use a flame thrower in a literal simulated room an hour into the game. Come on ID, give us the guns and ammo and we point and shoot. That;s how this works. Other than that the graphics were improved and the music felt good but it felt like a hollowed version of the fantastic reboot. They should call this DOOM CASUAL because even on harder difficulties it's not hard because it's hard, it's just hard to want to keep your eyes open. Do yourself a favor and play DOOM 2016 and try Eternal back to back. The difference is night and day."
563,uphold-rascal,"Aug 16, 2020",4,"Disappointing sequel. Doom 2016 was an exercise in restraint. Gameplay and story were streamlined. Doom Eternal developers thought that adding more game mechanics and things makes a better game but it makes the gameplay unfocused and frustrating. Too many mechanics (glory kills, blood punch, chainsaw, freeze bomb, flamethrower, dash) and you are forced to use them if you want to survive. There's too little ammo (your shotgun has 16 rounds at the start) so you have to constantly use the chainsaw animation to get more. Platforming is boring and doesn't add anything to the game other than padding the level length. The story is in your face and the writing is cringe-worthy. You can only start having fun after dropping to difficulty level, obtaining all the weapons and buying all the ammo upgrades. If you liked all the Doom games in the past 20 years, it will be hard to adjust to this. What's wrong if you just want to shoot a demon in the face without having to worry about all the additional mechanics."
564,Promotheus,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"I'm not sure what this is, but it certainly is not Doom. There is so much gimicky AAA-game garbage in this thing I don't even know where to begin. The fights feel like they are not about shooting and dodging, it's about quick time eventing your way through and using the weapons that you are supposed to use instead of finding your own strategy. Doom 2016 was something different from the original Doom formula, but it still was a good and entertaining game. The last stages of this game are soooo boring and you are so over the whole thing by the time you get there it's not even funny. I can't remember the last time I played a game this repetitive and uninspired. Instead of the near future-aesthetic of Doom 2016, we are now suddenly in some sort of Warhammer 40K-universe with knights and castles... Where did this come from? John Carmack said stories in games are pointless, but here we are dealt this clichéd and tripe garbage of ancient demons and artifacts, who gives a **** about this except a 13-year old who still will just play Fortnite anyway? I guess the worst part is that I've never felt this old when playing a game before. I feel as ancient as the Khan Maykr, and my torment when playing through this was worse than being in hell. This is what we get now. Doom was about using your wits and dodging the enemies. Now you have to push the R to make Doomguy flamethrower the demons and then kiill them so you get the armor shards."
565,Cygon,"Mar 21, 2020",2,"I'm really disappointed. DooM 2016 was a fantastic game. It had great pacing and enabled a variety of tactics - positioning, crowd management, ammo conservation and deciding how to deal with each group of enemies anew. All this while telling a great story, through exploration of humanity's failed ambitions on Mars. You really felt like the lone outsider who ignores all plans and advice because he's seen it all before. DooM Eternal feels uninspired and like it barely avoided becoming a generic loot shooter. Right upon launching the game, you find out that you'll either sign up for Bethesda.net or the game won't let you play. After all, you need to claim your ""rewards"" check out how you're now the Super Amazinglicious Slayer Level 159 with special weapon skin number #34 or whatever :-( Behind that is a very repetitive and gimmicky arena shooter. For some reason the DooM slayer now has an unexplained ""sanctuary"" from which he launches ""missions"" and some voice is telling him what to do (and he actually complies...) Gameplay-wise, you'll find that you can only carry enough ammo to defeat 4-5 low-level enemies and that the game is utterly overloaded with gimmicks. Poor Doom Slayer can hardly walk 100 steps without having to watch a cutscene, grab a weapon mod, collectible, new punching skill, new special ability, stat upgrade etc. And swinging around on poles, grabbing onto walls? Doesn't really work for this game. I'm loosing the will to continue playing... I've already got a flamer (R), chainsaw (C), fist (E) / blood fist (E) that the game continuously forces me to use to get ammo/health. I wonder how many more ""moves"" remain to be dumped on me (certainly wall running and grappling hook are still out there) that get in the way of enjoying the game."

I hate jump puzzles and granted they make sense in some games...

568,AllNewSuperfake,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"If you like this playstyle and visuals, you are certainly in for a treat. But if you are not comfortable with it, you won't be able to force yourself into liking it. My problem here is that most of the time, especially whenever you get into a brawl (not shootout, there is surprisingly little shooting happening), you are no longer in control of your movement since you beam from place to place, get stuck in animations that also reset the camera every time, and even when the action calms down you still get to do some light parkour that has the same flaw. It's like the game is constantly trying to play itself and I'm only in the way. It is technically flawless and certainly looks fantastic in a video, but I just can't get used to it, and I never really feel in control. While it certainly gives your actions a severe impact, it always left me feeling slightly disoriented, and while the constant finishers are very well done, you can only be impressed by them so many times. I'm also not too fond of all the tumbling fortnite-esque icons whenever you slay an enemy. In a DOOM game I expect the room to be littered with corpses when I'm done, not sparkling in rainbow colors. The visuals overall are are a little too playful for me, but that is once again up to your personal taste. Just be aware that it won't get better (or, depending on your view, worse). There's a lot of atmosphere, but it never felt scary or disgusting or at least claustrophobic. While the sound design is borderline perfect, the music wasn't too memorable either. To be honest: I have a hard time understanding the hype. But I guess 8-year-old me would have uttered a lot of ""cooools"" and ""woooahs"", so if you can get in that mindset (and I envy you for it), this is a game for you."

There's no freedom on how to approach a situation, now you have to figure out their combat puzzle. The platforming is ridiculous. I wanted to play Doom, not Super Mario or Donkey Kong. It was supposed to be a fps, not a parkour puzzle game. It's a boring, cartoonish waste of money."
570,BreakerOne20,"Mar 20, 2020",5,"I had high hopes for this one. The graphics, environments, and music are pretty awesome I must admit, but that is pretty much all this game is.Maybe I went in with the wrong expectations, but the gameplay is just too frantic. You run around trapped in circles in smallish arena rooms with very limited ammo trying to shoot demons that spawn from everywhere. When you run out of ammo (and you will constantly) you have to cut an enemy with a chainsaw... which also has ammo... to get more ammo.The story is told using codex entries which disturbs the flow of the game.  I felt like I really wanted to explore the cool environments for loot and lore, but there is none to be had.The platforming elements did not impress me.Maybe this is a really good shooter, but I don't really like ""pure"" shooters, and this was not the game to change my mind."
571,123456,"Mar 23, 2020",5,"Really wanted to like this game following the amazing 2016 DOOM. However, it just sucks. Almost without exception the new additions to the game suck. The storyline is this serious religious cult/DOOMGUY origin story (I have no idea if it is set before or after DOOM 2016) which you can either ignore or read all about in the codex, either way it doesn’t make a lot of sense so save yourself the bother and skip school. The combat is similar to 2016 but with some more buttons to press. The flamethrower is quite fun, but the glory kills seem graphically toned down. The mechanic is also a little clumsy by forcing you into melee a stunned demon for the health they drop, you are almost always putting yourself in danger. This was also true of 2016 but due to the more cramped maps it feels more apparent. The part that absolutely ruins the game is the Marauder. This boss has no business being in this type of game at all. It’s like he escaped from Dark Souls. DOOM was about fast paced shooting, running from a ton of different types of enemies and using the terrain to your advantage whilst you pick off the demons. This guy is completely contrary to all of that, slowing the pace down and being so much more difficult to kill (not impossible by any means) than any other demon in the game, including bosses. In addition, if any other demons are present it’s even more challenging as he takes so much focus, again unlike another other enemy. It’s a huge speedbump in the gameplay. And then there is the platforming. Why did they add all this climbing and jumping and dashing – this isn’t even DOOM anymore it’s Spiderman. For every combat section there is a puzzle platformer or parkour section. These make sense in ruined city sections or areas which are supposed to be off limits, but I’m supposed to believe the only entrance to this floating temple or whatever it is, this religious hub, is asking people to bounce and swing and vault their way across platforms to get to church? It’s just designed for the sake of platforming, without any logic. It’s like they made the perfect DOOM in 2016 but they had to justify their own jobs so they added a load of unnecessary things to put a new spin on it, whilst leaving out some understated but powerful elements, but it’s totally unbalanced. For instance, in 2016 DOOMGUY was this hyper violent, no time for your bullsh*t character. He broke everything to that was key to the mission, didn’t care about the instructions or requests he got as everything was literally going to hell anyway. This wasn’t a lack of a script or story, it was a pretty powerful message, a middle finger to authority and matched the games intense violent combat with brutal, and often amusing, narrative. It was also very easy for the player to follow and enjoy and kept the fast pace. In Eternal you have a story that seems to be missing it’s beginning. Then DOOMGUY seems either stoned or bored by the whole thing, and there is no humour whatsoever. You lose control of your character constantly for these cutscenes to play out, interrupting the flow of the game as you just wonder around priests talking about something you didn’t research before the scene started. If you do like platforms and puzzles there are a ton of secret items to find which sadly has very little appeal to me, not because of the concept but just because the main game is so tedious. The music doesn’t feel like it kicks as much as 2016, but that could be because I’m not enjoying the game as much. It certainly doesn’t stand out though. Visually it’s very well made – if anything the later levels are overly done. It does create a real other worldly sense, but it’s not really a world I find appealing. The hellscapes return and look great, as does burnt out earth cities. The gothic citadels look very nice, but it doesn’t fit with DOOM to be wondering around a damp old castle when this is sci-fi horror. Sadly I can’t recommend a game I was desperately looking forward to in 2020, it takes a modern classic, tries to enhance it, and by doing so it wrecks what made it a classic to begin with."
572,GwenDu29,"Mar 21, 2020",3,"first time I played arround 3 hours before it pissed me off and uninstall it, but I gave it a second chance played around 2 more hours and entirely giving up I was so mad that I deleted my save to never touch this ""thing"" again.I'm really disappointed because I really enjoyed 2016 doom but this one is not fun at all, you always have to do the same boring loop glory kill => chainsaw to stay alive and have ammo because they decrease really fast and most of the time you die extremely quickly even in medium, and you have too much stuff to deal with like grenade launcher, flame thrower.They are too much upgrades in this game (Runes + mods + weapons points + armor points  + Health/ammo/Armor, platform phases are really bad and the game design is not really good ( sometimes you looking for exits for minutes).It's clearly different from the fast Fps of 2016 and even if you liked doom 2016 you may not like this one, test are not enough I advise you to see some gameplay video to have make your own idea if you want to buy this game."
573,LunevZlodei,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"I don’t understand how THIS simulator of piano and ammunition collection can be called DOOM.No fun, no fun action game, you just run around and try to **** find bullets while the ****ing chainsaw is on cd.Absolutely unnecessary puzzle games that break the pace of the game, inadequate number of bugs and softlocks for AAA games."
574,bulrag33,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"to make a resource for survival out of enemies is complete nonsense ... it’s exactly doomguy locked with demons, and not vice versa. well, platforming hammered the last nail to the coffin lid. it' not Doom, it's ****"
575,gibber,"Mar 21, 2020",1,"This game has nothing from previous Doom. Played almost 4hrs. Story plot is flat, this arcade mode kills all the fun, and why I have to use weapon that developers intended to think is great, otherwise you are dead really quickly. A lot of power ups, pickups, tips. This game is overloaded with chaotic ideas. Doom was about story, violence and guns. This edition is just about flying around using jumps, rods, dash , walls and other s**t. Beginning was great, but more you advance, more frustrated you are. Wasted money and time."
576,baskalex,"Mar 21, 2020",4,"I LOVED 2016 version. I hoped for a great sequel and followed all the hype. And what we get is not a doom game, it's as far from it's 2016 predecessor as it can be. The pace is slowwww now. You are always distracted by some stupid notifications, camera flyovers and cutscenes. The ""story"" is a joke they made up to connect totally unconnected areas you are teleported all the time., the style is quite different. Gameplay is like ID devs had a brainstorm all the time and it was like ""uh oh, lets add this thing and that and all this stuff on top"". As a result we have 5 different upgrade systems - for weapons, for weapons upgrades, for the suite, for the runes, for the ship + all the cosmetics etc. And if in Doom 2016 it was quite clear and useful, here it's just a mess. Platforming ... why? Who wants jumps and ledgers and wall-climb in Doom? Then we have ammo-armor-health system. Could you imagine that you will be constantly out of ammo in Doom? So that instead of shooting demons and having fun you must constantly think when to set them on fire, when to use chainsaw to get ammo etc? And what if you are out of ammo AND fuel for chainsaw? That's it, you are dead.So for everyone who was hoping for a sequel for a great 2016 game, this is NOT it. It's sumthing slow, cumbersome and overloaded upgrade nonsense."
577,SpiderJerusalem,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"Overall downgrade compared to DOOM 2016, don't know if it's just my computer, but controls stutter constantly, slow loading, ""teleporting"" enemies, at least cut-scenes were more or less optimized.I wouldn't recommend buying game now, before they fix terrible performance issues."
578,faroukthehedge,"Mar 28, 2020",6,"Good but not great. Pros:* Engaging combat loop that encourages you to use the right tools for the right times and target the right spots.* Large levels packed with optional content and reward exploration.* Beautiful scenary, visually gorgeous looking and varied environments. Cons:* Heavy reliance on locked and wave-based arenas to pad out the length of the game.* Combat loop can feel restrictive and repetitive with having to harvest resources from enemies all the time and watching the same animations all time.* Too much platforming that feels shoe-horned, not exactly bad platforming but it can become annoying if you're not into it.* Confusing story and plot, thankfully it can be mostly ignored. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to any FPS enthusiast, but not at its current full price."
579,FULLYADAMATTACK,"Mar 22, 2020",7,"The absolute beauty of Doom is how simple it is, and yet complete.  Doom Eternal loses sight of this basic tenet of the Doom experience.  Everything Doom 2016 focused on throwing aside story and unnecessary extra and getting to the main course.  (illustrated in an early animation of doomslayer throwing away the story queues by use of force)  But Doom Eternal seems to go the exact opposite direction.  It's like they got a group of teenagers together in a room and asked them what they wanted to see in Doom and they all asked for more complication and unnecessary story.  It's not a bad game.  But it's not pure.  It's not joyous.  It's a very modern shooter with all the complicated trapping that come with that."
580,faircritic,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"Overhyped piece of generic crap.I don´t find it interesting, innovative, neither exiting. I´m amazed how low the press is always promoting garbage like this. Enemies are the crappiest design. This game is just another fps and inferior that the previous. I don´t giving a 0 because there's worse around, but this game is mediocre and more of the stupid same thing."
581,dominath,"Mar 22, 2020",4,I loved the last game... This Doom makes me feel that I'm from an action-fantasy anime of some kind with a pinch of extra glimmer and shine for kids to enjoy. I think the fans are very disappointed. PS: the soundtracks are still good tho.
582,rage77,"Mar 21, 2020",5,"Ok so after a number of hours in, I don't know where I am story wise, half way? 20%? 75%?I feel a bit disappointed.In DOOM 2016 I felt badass! All them demons were my **** and I was there to make them pay!Now I feel like I'm just doing jumping puzzles half the time which are increasing in difficulty so you barely know where the **** you're supposed to go and the rest of the time I'm fighting for my ****ing life. I'm their ****ing **** now. I even went down in difficulty and it still feels hectic as **** and not that I am in any way shape or form in control of anything.I guess this might be purposeful. I could be squishy in the first half of the story for a reason and later go crazy bananas overpowered. I'm hoping.If not then this was a downgrade from 2016 for me. I can see what they wanted to do with the game. But I doubt this will pay off.2016 was a great balance of fighting, running and jumping.This is so off balance, it's like someone forcing you to have a paintball battle in a tiny little playground with swings, carouselles and slides but the floor is lava and pieces fall off if you stand still for one second.**** just too damned busy.My two cents."
583,Lytbringr,"Mar 22, 2020",6,"Having just played Doom 2016 with my wife I gotta ask id why they changed some of the things they did. The FIRST level had me fighting Cacodemons, an enemy from mid-2016, extra lives seem out of place,, and hand-holdy, like they knew the game was too hard at first. Why can't I one-punch stagger base zombies or imps any more? I can punch a concrete wall, but have to bunch zombies half a dozen times to stagger, 2016 they were legit fodder. In 2016 keycards were attached to bodies and had a story, here the first one I found was just... floating in a garage. I feel like rather than continue to do new things, id felt a need to bring in some old (or antiquated in this case) elements. I find it hard to see this real and sometimes surreal apocalypse setting, followed by a neon green 1up in an elevator shaft. Adding climbing while removing crouching seems odd, and why is your icon on the green map ALSO green? In 2016 you were yellow. Thank you for sharing this video, I think part of my problem comes from having played the previous title all week, so some of the new/odd-feeling design choices hit harder. I miss punching, though. Tl;Dr: They tried to hard to do some weird stuff, and it hurts the game coming from 2016."
584,Troopski,"Mar 22, 2020",4,"I played for 3 hours and have requested a refund. Im sure some people may like it, but I am not willing to pay full price for a few reasons. If you wanted a sucessor to doom 2016, this isnt it.-Action is broken up by slippery platfoming and cutscenes.-The arenas and map design seems cluttered, i get stuck on emenies, invisible walls, ledges and fences too often, which causes death (playing on UV)-It is a little cartoony, strange choice.I may pick it up for half price."
585,Lithariel,"Mar 22, 2020",7,"I never played Doom 2016 when that came out and that ""Glory Kill"" Mechanic didn't look interesting to me at all. I also didn't that Level setup of having a ""Arena"" style room where you fight then exit into some connective corridor into the next ""Arena"" room. But i did play the original Doom and Doom II back in the day. Excessively. I seen Doom Eternal on YouTube where one of the Developers showcased it, and praised all of those nifty ""Combat Puzzle"" like elements. The graphic looked super interesting, borderline gorgeous, in a style just like the Quake games where, if you ever played Quake 3 Arena ... some Levels here look directly from there. Broken Church Cathedrals, destroyed Cityscapes intertwined with weird demonic flesh growing. Scary and yet pretty. So what do i like about it? The Music is pretty good, if you like light, scary Metal, it fits right in with the Graphic theme ... which is also good. I like both quite allot, those where the main draw to this game.I also like all the different things you can do with the Weapons Alternate Fire, all upgrades. It really feels very good to shoot those Demons, seeing their body get ripped to into pieces, flesh flying off, revealing the intestines and bones underneath. What do i not like. The first thing i dislike, is those ""Corridors"" between two Combat Arenas. You can Double Jump, Double Dash(even in mid air), grab certain kinds of marked walls and crawl up like Spiderman (which doesn't fit into this game at all) and there are horizontal Poles that you can jump towards that then give you speed and height. I would like to just SHOOT DEMONS and not have to deal with a First Person Jump'n'Run, I not know those segments did bore me quite allot. They where not particular hard, just boring and annoying. Then the actual Demon Shooting. The ""Arenas"" in which you fight Demons are super tiny and once you are inside Demons will spawn all around you in waves and you get attacked from all possible angles. If you stay still for more then 2 seconds you probably die, so the name of the game is to keep moving around that Arena.But that's not all, the amount of Ammunition you can hold at first is VERY tight, so you permanently run low on it. This forces you to kill one or more of hose ""Fodder Demons"" with your Chainsaw, which is a skill that recharges with Demons you kill, meaning if you miss too much you are screwed. What the base Gameplay Loop in those Arenas is, is first seeing which Major Demon is around you. Then switching to a Weapon that allows you to hit that Demons weak spot, while dodging the Fodder Demons.When you start to loose too much Health you have to shoot one of those Fodder Demons, which then starts to blink so you can Glory Kill it to gain Health back(or, search for a Medikit in the area).You also have to keep an eye on your Ammunition and Chainsaw skill so if you run low on Ammunition (which you WILL constantly) you need to run up to a Fodder Demon and use the Chainsaw to gain Ammunition back.And lastly you have that ""Flame Belch"" shoulder mounted Flame Thrower that you can use to set Demons on fire which then drop Armor Tokens when you damage them, or kill them (though there are pickups too). Overall, i do not like those Jump'n'Run segments between two Arenas and i not like the Arenas size, they give me anxiety and claustrophobic vibes.Also I still dislike all those mechanics surrounding ""Glory Kills"" to regain Health, using a Chainsaw to refill Ammunition or to set Demons on fire using the ""Flame Belch"" Cannon. The combat is allot more frantic then it is strategic, though there IS a very Strategic gameplay as to how to beat those bigger Demons. Too bad, this disappointed me. What i wanted, was a simple game with challenging Levels that i can run through and kill Demons. Just like the Original Doom.And yet there are good starting points right here. Just trash the Jump'n'Run segments, ditch that ""Arena"" style combat and make a big Level where you let the Player run around, kill Demons, select upgrades and what not."
586,aberro,"Mar 22, 2020",5,"At first I was hyped about new Doom announcement, then after seeing trailers with **** rap music, **** slogans and **** skins, I became wary, and now, after 2 hours in game I'm kinda dissapointed. It's not, like, thrash bad, it's just... empty. Soulless. Like yet another pixelated platformer or yet another survival with craft. Developers tried to attract as many players as they can, so they've just stuffed this game with everything, but ended up with just pile of garbage. Arcade shooter, mixed with mario brothers jumping, with mobile games grinding, points, bonuses, etc, with moba silly skins, and flavored it with hellish surroundings. Level design is mediocre, invisible walls here and there, but not where they need to be, which was mitigated by respawning. Constant mix of level styles is eye-poping, decorations and decals have no logic whatsoever, seems more like levels was randomly generated from presets. Once you finished yet another battle and stopped for a second, you realize that you feel almost zero immersion. This game is ok if you want to strain your spinal reflexes for hour or two after work, but nothing more. I've recently played Black Mesa and sometimes I forgot to eat and I underslept for three days - this is how good game should be played."

There's enough level variation  (Earth vs Mars for example) for a 20 hours gameplay. Though level design isn't the reason why someone should pick up Doom Eternal. Combat: Combat is where Doom Eternal shines. The fast paced combat is so good that I can literally play it again and feel the same adrenaline rush again. The combat sparked few opinions about 2016 vs Doom Eternal but I personally haven't played Doom 2016. Without 2016 in context, I found the combat to be super fun. Bosses: This is where I'm taking off a point for Doom Eternal. As much fun as Marauder boss fight is, the last few boss fights felt boring and repetitive and honestly didn't feel like doom eternal fights at all."

On olemassa myös muita käytettäviä aseita, kuten Plasma Gun, Chaingun ja Heavy Cannon vain muutamia mainitakseni. Kaikki nämä aseet edellyttävät ammuksia, ja voit löytää niitä kaikilta tasoilta, mutta voit myös hankkia ammuksia tappamalla demoneja moottorisahalla.

621,Pontifice6,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"A fast-paced, chaotic action shooter with a wealth of content and a long campaign."
622,Monogony8998,"Mar  6, 2021",10,Best game I've played last year. Dam awesome and what a joy to play. Movement and combat soo smooth.
623,Bathophobia51,"Mar  6, 2021",10,Blows Doom 2016 out of the water in every way. Combat is a lot more cerebral and the AI is very challenging. You actually have to solve a combat puzzle in Eternal instead of just spamming the super shotty or gauss cannon to fight everything like in 2016.
624,Eggwhites4,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"As a sequel, Eternal delivers on many fronts. From the diversified visuals along with the environments they represent, to the nuances and mechanics of the combat system being *greatly* expanded. Eternal is as rewarding and complex as you make it."
625,Vibrometer7048,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"The gameplay is amazing and well known to be amazing. Doom has always been a combat first type of game. If the game isn't fun to play, then what's the point, right? And although the gameplay is the star of the show, the story beneath it all is friggin brilliant and well written. I love how most of the narrative is told through the codexes in 2016 and Eternal."
626,Ashen96,"Mar 14, 2021",10,"Extremely fast paced. The most intense shooter on the market.Fantastic enemies, awesome soundtrack, fun game design.Keep moving, keep switching weapons and keep glory killing and chainsawing people for health and ammo.Play on a difficulty that challenges you."
627,Strider615615,"Mar 14, 2021",10,"Best non-open world single-player game in my opinion, and easily top 3 single-player."
628,Cmdrmark784,"Mar 14, 2021",10,"This game is absolutely phenomenal. By all means, you should play it. The people who say that your creativity is limited in this game because of the weak-point system are just wrong, definitely try it for yourself. Don't listen to the people who say that you HAVE to play it on Nightmare, they're just wrong, play it at whatever level makes you feel like the ultimate demon slayer"
629,Bnahabra30,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"This is for sure the best FPS I've played in my life, it's beautiful, the songs are a perfect match, weapons are fun etc.."
630,Demiurgic95,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"Once a player learns the rules of the game, once he understands the interplay between weapons, abilities, and enemies Doom Eternal becomes vastly more enjoyable than Doom 2016."
631,Antanoshin835,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"It is so much more complex, dynamic, fast, and filled with adrenaline that in harder arenas you feel like an action movie hero despite - and even because of - the fact that you're usually one mistake away from death."
632,SuperiorSlave99,"Mar 15, 2021",10,My favorite game of all time this game is the closest thing you can get to crystal meth.
633,Bobbyreaper10,"Mar 15, 2021",10,Really amazing game but all it needs is more master levels and mod support.
634,Choryanmj5,"Mar 15, 2021",10,This game is a true masterpiece. The best shooter I've played in my whole life.
635,Dirtywizard44,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"It's the culmination of 25 years of FPS games. Intense, fun, and brutally difficult in parts. You'll die a lot but it never feels unfair and retrying is always enjoyable. If you like FPS games you probably already own this. If you're new to FPS games you should get DOOM 2016 first as DOOM Eternal is the sequel."
636,Iceborn50,"Mar 16, 2021",10,Amazing game. Never has game make you feel like such a badass like this game.
637,Billybigbro92,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"One of the best first person shooters ever. Feels like StarCraft 2 as an FPS game. So much to manage and worry about. Simply perfect gameplay constantly. The campaign is a perfect way to learn all the weapons, movements, strategies, abilities, and more."
638,Metatier206,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"Amazing game. Reminds of God of war 3, Quake and Doom 2. Top tier arena shooter."
639,Drjaydenm621,"Mar 16, 2021",10,A great FPS that provides a good challenge and keeps you on your toes. You will need to play the way that the game wants you to play though.
640,Missinghorn022,"Mar 16, 2021",10,Hugo Martin helped me to see. My eyes have been opened. Let this game help you to see. Rip and tear... until it is done.
641,Speeddemon9,"Mar 17, 2021",10,"If you like fast-paced FPS shooters from hell, then there is nothing faster or more intense than this that I know of. The best game in the DOOM series yet. Although DOOM 2016 is still awesome, DOOM Eternal is one step ahead. Action non-stop, mixed with some small puzzles and collectibles. Highly recommended!"
642,Lucid30,"Mar 17, 2021",10,Easily one of the best FPS of all time. I don't know how they made it even better than Doom 2016. You get a chain saw and a hook harpoon attached to your double-barrel shotgun.
643,Phinehas91,"Mar 17, 2021",10,"Doom (2016) ramped up to 1000. Better, mechanically deeper and harder. Endlessly fun."
644,Happentrack895,"Mar 17, 2021",10,Beating the game on nightmare difficulty took about 20 hours and it was really fun and challenging.

652,Oxfordrokz64,"Feb 17, 2021",10,Doom is boom. And this Doom eternal is the doomiest boomiest game yet. in Doom Eternal you play as the guy from the first game except this time: ALIENS.

656,Ginglyform4,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"Jogo incrivelmente divertido. Já joguei todos os jogos DOOM e este é de longe o melhor (em termos de diversão). O que quero dizer com isso é que o jogo NÃO se leva a sério às vezes. Ao contrário dos jogos Wolfenstein mais recentes, DOOM Eternal faz isso BEM. O exagero sobre tudo isso realmente contribui para a experiência geral do DOOM e a história, embora apressada, é MUITO divertida e interessante. Claro, você não está jogando DOOM para a história."
657,Urolith102,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"Die Waffen, Fähigkeiten, Modifikatoren, Feinde, Rätsel usw. usw. machen dieses Spiel so unterhaltsam wie es ist. Sie haben eine Vielzahl von Feinden zu kämpfen, von denen, die Sie kennen und gerne töten, bis zu einigen neuen, die in einem DOOM-Spiel noch nicht gesehen wurden. Die Waffen sind alle ziemlich normale DOOM-Waffen, aber sie fühlen sich so ... gut in diesem Spiel an, dass dieser Teil schwer zu erklären ist."
658,Palamate5554,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"Doom is very good, I like doom. Doom is eternal, I like eternal. Doom is slayer, I like slayer. Doom got demons, I like demons. I dont like muscular doom guy because im not gay, but the cacodemon do be lookin kinda smexy"

664,Herpetoid5,"Mar  2, 2021",10,"De game neemt alles wat in DOOM 4 werkte en verbetert het gewoon verder, de strijd is sneller, de muziek slaat harder, de plot is dikker en er is zoveel meer te weten en te begrijpen, de wereld is groter, rijker met meer verkenning en nieuwe mechanica in termen van gameplay en beweging zelf."
665,Clochard5769,"Mar  2, 2021",10,"Doom faz o jogador se mover mais e pensar mais ao longo do jogo, especialmente em combate, levando a um tipo de jogo mais divertido e envolvente, os melhores momentos que você pode ter neste jogo se eles não estivessem lendo as peças do códice, então eles estão o grosso disso quando fogo e ferro, o Slayer e os asseclas do Inferno estão frente a frente, é surreal, é incomparável e é um trabalho de magia."

670,Clancy238,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is one of the best Singleplayer shooters I've played in a long time, so much to the point where I beat the main campaign three times (twice on Ultra Violence, once on Nightmare). The combat flow in this game is so fast paced; making use of all the weapons at your disposal as well as switching between various mods to counter the weak points that Demons have, which makes learning all of the Demons weaknesses that much more satisfying."
671,Darkslayer905,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"This game is just amazing, the soundtrack, the fast paced combat, going through all your weapons until theyre empty, chainsawing a dude and repeat until it is done. Play it on Ultra Violence for the perfect experience."
672,Taelun15,"Mar 17, 2021",10,This game really makes you feel like Doomguy. 5 outta 5. Best shooter I've played.
673,Emididcat3,"Mar 17, 2021",10,"Oh my god this game not only looks gorgeous and is more challenging than its predecessor, but whenever I play I become the unstoppable Exodia as I rip & tear demons across different dimensions while heavy metal blasts in the background.

674,Rkingsboro2497,"Mar 17, 2021",10,Love the game it is my first shooter game and it was difficult but i enjoyed it the music and challenge was amazing.
675,Dnamer90,"Mar 20, 2021",10,Great game. Big improvement over Doom 2016 but its more demanding and has higher skill gap. Requires you to turn on your brain and think rather than mindless shooting of Doom 2016.
676,Lordshimra20,"Mar 20, 2021",10,Awesome intense first person shooter action. fast paced and in your face. like other DOOM games just jacked up.
677,Digestingorb47,"Mar 20, 2021",10,Best game of the decade no micro transactions no bs. Hope they release mods support soon.
678,Volpe6668,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"All in all its among the best shooters Ive ever played, though I gotta admit, DOOM2016 I liked the dark setting better. On the other hand Eternal is closer to the original DOOM in terms of flashyness and gameplay is way better."
679,Thade2032,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"Certainly a favorite FPS, extremely fast gameplay that forces you to make quick, and important gameplay decisions in the thick of battle leading to fluid, and satisfying gory mayhem."
680,Spidergnomes752,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"The gameplay loop of Doom Eternal requires more of your attention than Doom 2016 with the way it forces you to use every trick and weapon to complete each combat encounter. I personally think this was a great move, and the two games stand side by side as some of the greatest single player shooter campaigns of a generation."
681,Phantom89,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is a more challenging game compared to 2016 DOOM. This game has far more engaging fights, a lot of action, moving, dodging, weapon & character customization. The story is decent (tho you most likely won't play this game for it's story), graphics are good, level design is detailed and often looks breathtaking, demon and character models are well done (demons look more damaged and bloody as you deal damage to them) and audio is great too. You may be overwhelmed from the beginning by a lot of demons and various game mechanics and die at least a few times, but you push thru frustration you will improve, learn game mechanics, demon weaknesses etc and enjoy the game a lot more. I recommend this game for anyone who likes fast paced challenging shooters and of course to all DOOM series fans."
682,Skipper110,"Mar 20, 2021",10,Great and fun game. Only the Bethesda servers are annoying sometimes. Other than that it's a must buy.
683,Three_kornhole3,"Mar 21, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is soo good. Best game I've played in long time. Chainsaw goes brrrrrrrr

686,Xaelath220,"Mar 25, 2021",10,The Ultimate FPS Experience. Nothing beats this game. Soundtrack and gameplay is pure masterpiece. If you want to push your skills to the limit then DOOM Eternal is for you. I recommend playing on Nightmare difficulty even if you're a newcomer for the best experience.
687,Rlongw26,"Mar 25, 2021",10,Easily one of the best first person shooters I've ever played. Really replayable too.

692,Mainkiller7,"Mar 28, 2021",10,One of the true landmarks of an amazing game - such a beautiful form and what makes DOOM the father of all FPS games that exist today and still manages to show it can do it all better then any of them.
693,Randyab04,"Mar 28, 2021",10,Brilliant gameplay start on the easy level first to get the feel of the game. Then work up from there.
694,Travious80,"Mar 28, 2021",10,One of the best games i've ever played. Love it what a great game and modern classic.
695,Misterbelvede64,"Mar 28, 2021",10,"Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, and the Ancient Gods DLCs are some of the best games I've ever played. I've enjoyed every minute of the time I've put into them. These games are shining examples of what happens when highly skilled developers take the time to truly understand their audience. Highly recommended."
696,The_Peig_Lord8,"Mar 28, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is a direct upgrade from Doom 2016. One you've gotten the core game play dynamics down (glory kill=health, flamethrower=armor, chainsaw=ammo) you should be able to counter any demon that comes your way. All in all this game is addictive and definitely a must get."
697,Spluush60,"Mar 28, 2021",10,Funniest thrill ride I've played. It's a great game You should buy it the dlc's are good too.
698,Bananaboy640,"Mar 28, 2021",10,"If you love skill based action games, get Doom Eternal. You won't regret it."
699,Doomhauer3,"Mar 28, 2021",10,"Definitely has made it up to one of my favorite games of all time. Once you play eternal there is no going back to DOOM 2016. Eternal perfects the formula with some new mechanics and takes what you remember best from the old games (high speed ripping and tearing) and leaves out what you tried to forget (running around confusing maps looking for that one stupid key card you cant find anywhere). If you dig silly, convoluted lore and backstory the game has you covered there with codex entries. It doesn't force the story down your throat so if you hate that stuff you can just rip and tear until it is done."
700,Snnkz24,"Mar 28, 2021",10,Probably the best FPS I have ever played. I usually play competitive multiplayer games but I can use this as aim training sit down and relax on nightmare mode. The mechanics are pretty unique can keep you engaged for hours.
701,Joker66,"Mar 29, 2021",10,A Masterpiece of the FPS genre: 10/10. The OG of runnin and gunnin. Enough said...
702,Theplatinum40,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"Overall just an amazing experience with some of the most engaging gameplay I've ever experienced. Obviously, the metal music is one of the best parts of DOOM, it really makes the game. Overall, it has a hard learning curve that is very rewarding once learned, and it is a spectacular title overall."
703,Nschaefer1221,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"No doubt that this is the best game in this series so far, but you still can't beat the original."
704,Morlian08,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"The Story. The Graphics. The Speed. The Gore. This game is amazing. Helps when all I want to do is ""Rip And Tear, Until It Is Done"""
705,Fades8700,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal was the game created to complete what was Doom and its story, this continues with what was Doom (2016) and improves it. A great improvement, pure action, violence, and metal (OST). Rip & Tear!"
706,Gregnogg29,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is what every action game's combat strives to be. Doom 2016 was great and introduced many new ideas that worked well, but what Eternal did was take these ideas and further flesh them out to create something incredible. They saw that the main idea of the game was to never stop moving so they made you faster and gave you more ways to traverse i.e. monkey bars, dash, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grapple hook on your shotgun. This can even be seen in the dlc (especially part 2). They saw that people liked the crucible blade but didn't like the fact that you have to wait for a pickup to use it. For me, it became more of a a rarity so I didn't end up using it much unless I knew that there was a pickup by me. But the devs looked at this and created the Sentinel hammer which recharges whenever you perform 2 glory kills or pickup a refill. As well as many different enemy ideas that focus on much more specific weaknesses such as only being vulnerable to a specific attachment on your shotgun. Though I've never really liked enemy's where you have to wait it out for them to attack just to expose their weak point and doom has a few that could use a little more of an offensive approach (I don't have too much trouble with marauder but that's just because he's very defensive and tries to attack as much as possible). Lastly one of my favorite additions that they add into the ancient gods is swinging from your grapple hook in the platforming sections. The base game had some pretty good platforming but the grapple hook really added some new spice to further flesh it out (I just wish they used it in some of the battles). Doom Eternal's combat is fast, refreshing, and something completely new that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great shooter filled with many incredible moments and well made dlc."
707,Lordnadtor90,"Mar 29, 2021",10,i liked doom 2016 a lot but this game makes that game look like slow boring piece of trash lol.
708,Demertech889,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"I love this game, it is strategic and fun. Violence is a massive part of this game and it is awesome. The game can be difficult on the higher difficulty's and can pose a real challenge or you can play it on a lower difficulty and just enjoy it."
709,Catdung_6,"Mar 29, 2021",10,"An overall excellent game, with interesting and intense gameplay and interesting puzzles. Definitely worth the 60 bucks."
710,Ekaspari932,"Mar 29, 2021",10,Game is great and people have already said everything about why its great. The id tech 7 is great engine runs great and looks amazing.

713,Goldenblyat244,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"There was a lot about this game turned me off and kept me from giving this game the go it deserved, such as glory kills etc - but I have to say it is easily the best campaign shooter I've played since Titanfall 2."
714,DiamondStriker2,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"A really good one of the many Dooms, it is beautiful and exciting! I love this a lot."
715,Lamoman9,"Mar 31, 2021",10,"Much better than 2016. I felt Doom 2016 was kind of mediocre and overrated. You could beat the game on hardest difficulty spamming supershotgun and it got very repetitive by the middle section. The levels got bland and samey. This game is massive improvement especially gameplay wise in every single way. The levels are great and varied. Combat is deeper, more tactical and allows for more varied playstyles which is 2016 contrary to the many morons who claim this game is restrictive. Ammo is not an issue once you start upgrading ammo, weapon switch, and upgrade Praetor Suit Explosive Piñatas and Thicker Skin. This game is a masterpiece."
716,Ironman40,"Mar 31, 2021",10,Way better than Doom 2016. I felt this was an improvement pretty much across the board.
717,kilLTek,"Jan 22, 2021",9,"Easily a FPS MASTERPIECE This game played on Nightmare and especially on Ultra-Nightmare is the Dark Souls of First Person Shooters (FPS) . Doom 2016 was a nice introduction but Eternal (DE) is evolution. I played through Doom 2016 once and it was cool but for me it had no replay value. Eternal is something different. This is a Metal Concert, the definition of adrenalin fueled gameplay and you are constantly in the mosh pit! Levels like Nekravol, holy **** This is what I expect when I hear DOOM, You fighting Hell and Demons fearing YOU - just great stuff and the game looks gorgeous at all times and runs extremely smooth! The story is completely optional but after having so much fun playing the game, I wanted to know the story behind it all and it is fascinating; it feels like a biblical comic - creative stuff!And the music... just perfect! Mick Gordon delivered once again! It is punishing and brutally hard. You have to learn how to fight all these different demons in different constellations and in a way which suits YOU!You have to view the game as a sort of a live action combat puzzle, you cannot just use one weapon and get through every level - especially not on higher difficulty.On Nightmare it is really frustrating at times, but there is always a way to 'Git Gud' as in Dark Souls or Sekiro.This game is made to be mastered. To get better.This is not a game which you play through once and you seen it all, done it all - no. I actually wish that they made the game more like Sekiro - only one difficulty: NIGHTMARE, and well Ultra-Nightmare for the elite players. This way the message would have been clear for everyone - this is a skill based FPS, not some cookie cutter walk through the park experience (which honestly everything below nightmare is, once you've played on it). It is no exaggeration if I say: If you can play Doom on Nightmare, you are ready for all other FPS games.It's like the ring to rule them all. Going back to games like CoD feels almost boring. The dynamic and multitasking aspect which DE offers is unmatched.Freeze 'em, burn 'em, shot 'em, nade 'em, and use the right weapon with the the right attachment to kill 'em. Manage your chainsaw loads and grenades; what runes do you like the most, when to switch them up? What suit points to use first? Did you master the weapon switching yet? Can't progress at a slayer gate? Go on Youtube, look how the Pro's doing it. Be **** amazed, 'cause seriously high-level Doom Eternal is a league of its own. And no, you don't have to shot all those weakpoints, you could just shotgun/ballista or heavy cannon/rocket your enemy's in the chest or ice bomb and use the chain gun or any other weapon combination you have in your arsenal and you LIKE. The possibilities and combinations are almost endless. Almost every week players find a new way to kill the marauder. Platforming is part of the equation, that way you learn how to maneuver in those big arenas. But yeah, sometimes it is definitely annoying.The only negative aspect I can think of is, when DE is not working properly: 'no target', no blood punch registration and bugs here and there but this is rarely an big issue, but still worth noting. What is lacking for me to give it a 10/10 is the lack of training tools to master various demons and fights like they implemented various training scenarios for the player to learn chainsaw, ice bomb etc.The demon prison aka the 'Ripatorium' could have been a way more useful tool if you could go in there and customize your fight aka decide for yourself against which demon you want to fight and learn how to beat them more efficiently and learn their attacks in an isolated environment.This is a thing which still bothers me, even after hundreds of hours of playing, that I still don't quiet understand how much damage I get from various attacks from different demons. And you have almost no chance to learn that in a big arena fight if several demons are attacking you at the same time.A Load Checkpoint system or quick save system would have been great, to train various instances without having to replay the whole level or to use 3rd party software to train for Ultra Nightmare. At this point I feel like all people who wanted essentially a Doom 16 v2 are done with their grieving and real FPS connaisseurs are more and more understanding the greatness DE offers. And finally, the community and devs. The communication is just fantastic! A really healthy community with such a caring game director - Hugo Martin - you love to see that and I honestly never seen such communication with any other AAA title.  And mind you, I am pretty late to the party. My personal rating: 9/10"
718,Williow9,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"Best game in the entire series by far, and this comes from a hardcore old school Doom fan."
719,Stretchbut8,"Feb  1, 2021",10,Pros:-Great soundtrack-Great level design-Good variety of weapons-Decent length-Brutal as Hell-Super graphics-You only use violence to interact with your environment-Within 10 seconds you shoot demons-High replay value Cons:-Lack of moding-Multiplayer is forgettable
720,Whitemonkey2,"Feb  2, 2021",10,"This is a brilliant game about three things: moving fast, killing demons, and metal. It does these three things so ludicrously well that it is impossible not to recommend. Plenty of thinkpieces have discussed at length why exactly this game is so good on such a purely visceral level, so I'll leave it to them to give you the details. Suffice to say, this isn't to be missed."
721,Daniel912,"Feb  2, 2021",10,"Rarely do we get to see a AAA title where every aspect of the game in centered around one single element, in this case, combat. Art direction, sound design, story, movement, level design... everything here is built to create the best FPS experience possible, and DOOM delivers. This is definitely one of the best FPS campaigns in recent years."
722,Smegil258,"Feb  2, 2021",10,"Great graphics, excellent story, awesome gameplay and pretty good optimization. Almost everything is really well done in the game and there is nothing bad in it. I would recommend this masterpiece to everyone."
723,Hijukaing314,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"All in all, from a gameplay standpoint it's one of the best SP FPS games ever, and a clear improvement over Doom 2016 in all of the ways that matter most. There's really not much else like this in the modern market. In an age in which arena shooters and movement based shooters are dying and the market is overwhelmingly shifting towards slower, less intense genres like tactical shooters and Battle Royales, it's nice to know that a game like this can still be made and find success. I'll get sappy for a second and say this: Thank you, id Software. You're the only AAA developer that still cares about the things I value in a shooter."
724,Jeffery_lubin3,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is a masterpiece of a game, with significant improvements that makes it vastly more enjoyable than Doom 2016. New mechanics introduce new gameplay opportunities and increased movement, while the demons of Hell increase in strength, numbers, and ferocity."
725,Trytung_but_ho2,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Quick Pros and Cons List ProsAdditional mechanics, allowing for more options in combat and faster movement, further increasing the intensity of Doom’s refined gameplay.A brand new album of music from Mick Gordon that is the same high quality from Doom 2016An improved, well optimized engine with better graphicsGood variety of areas in the campaign, ranging from Earth, Hell, and otherworldly dimensions ConsI ran into a few bugs, including one game breaking one with invincible demons."
726,OverdoseonK2,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Simply put, the greatest first person shooter ever made and a must play for fans of the genre and the Doom series. Very few games feature enemy and weapon lineups where each and every tool at your disposal has a huge strength and weakness from situation to situation."
727,Paintrain711,"Mar  2, 2021",10,Was für ein Spiel. Als Fan von Old-School-Shootern ist dieses Spiel ein Hauch frischer Luft.
728,Nojisn23,"Mar  2, 2021",10,"I can't recommend this game hard enough, but one thing is for sure, it's too good to be real."
729,Dolandusk1917,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"If you think this game is too hard go play ""Call of Destiny: Hide Behind Cover Edition"" and leave the real games to the big boys."

732,Stridor22,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"Pros:+ Environments are breathtakingly badass. [Seriously if hell looks like this then sign me the ♥♥♥♥ up!]+ Fast travel makes collectables more bearable. [It's unlocked for the current level, but only for the current session, so if you finish the level you'll have to get back to the end of the level before you can fast travel again every time. It's a cool but flawed system that collectable hungry games should implement.]+ Looks and runs flawlessly. [No issues here, id Software sure knows how to make great engines.]+ More challenging than Doom (2016). [It has a much higher skill ceiling than 2016, mostly because of the way the game is designed.]+ OST [Certified banger.] Con/Pro:+/- The way the game is designed it almost forces you to play a certain way. [You want to main 2-3 weapons like in Doom (2016)? Well too bad! You're going to have to use everything in your arsenal.]"
733,Brad_likSuborn3,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"Tai, ko gero, yra viena maloniausių patirčių, susijusių su vieno žaidėjo žaidimais. Pirmiausia buvau skeptiškas ir maniau, kad „Doom 2016“ man gali pakakti vien todėl, kad „Doom Eternal“ įgūdžių ribos tikriausiai yra per aukštos mano skoniui. Aš buvau neteisus,"

741,Eunomia413,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"Okay so the only problem is this is the first game I played that will give me a headache. Not because it's frustrating- but because it feels like I'm on a roller coaster. Except, instead of ups, downs & loops, it's constantly flying through the air, shooting meat off of Demons and ripping their bodies open."
742,Esperanto979,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"The game is intense, and one of the few that deserves a title ""Action Packed"". On easier difficulties, you can play at a more relaxed (playing Doom to relax?) pace, but when the difficulties are higher, it's on."
743,Circumflex524,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"The graphics are beautiful, the game runs so smooth despite being so fast-paced. The music is beautifully orchestrated with the events happening on scene. For sure, the game is a power trip, and it feels good."
744,Sonatahoad19,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"The story is fine and interesting, but you don't really play Doom for the lore. My only complaint is I actually don't like the multiplayer from Eternal, I prefer 2016's style. I may be in the minority there, but I would recommend this game for its single-player experience only. Its multiplayer is more of a cute knock-off, to me."
745,Rotocracy812,"Mar  3, 2021",10,"Најбољи фпс у последњих 10 година који не жртвује ништа да би био пријатан и задовољан. Доом Етернал је ремек-дело, има добру музику, добру борбу и изненађујуће добру Доом причу која нема Цитизен Кане-а, али је веома забавна. Обично вреди цене, али је неопходно купити приликом продаје."
746,Tigerism1,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"One of the best DOOM games ever made, I have truly enjoyed playing this game and I honestly believe I will never get bored or sick of it! Amazing to play!"
747,Nosebag94,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"I give it a 14/10, and I have played every DOOM game there is because even though I wasn't around when it started, I am glad I was introduced to it at a young age!"
748,Youngberry24,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"Quake'in, Doom'un düşmanca kadrosu ile şiddetli, yatıştırıcı tavrıyla evlenen ham beyin yoğunluğu. Bu oyundan zevk almak, belirli bir zihin çerçevesi, kendinize meydan okumak ve anın sıcağında düşünmek için belirli bir isteklilik gerektirir. Ancak, kendi şartlarınızda karşılaşırsanız son derece ödüllendiricidir. Neredeyse her silah, Doom 2016'nın 2 silahlı oynanış tarzının tanıtımının tam aksine, önemli bir role sahip olduğunu hissediyor. Oyuncuyu ekipmanlarını akıllıca kullanmaya iten cephane sayıları büyük ölçüde azaltıldı. Genel olarak, bu farkı tanımlama şeklim, Doom 2016'nın silahlarını herhangi bir zamanda çok fazla sonuç olmadan kullanılabilecek bir oyuncak seti olarak ele almasıdır. Doom Eternal onları bir araç olarak görüyor ve başarıya ulaşmak için onları iyi kullanmalısın."
749,Maudlin3697,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"Not only does DOOM Eternal have an amazing combat system and AI, it also mixes certain elements of puzzle solving alongside gut-wrenching, adrenaline fueled combat that will surely eradicate any stress that you have and leave you craving for more blood and guts."
750,Troikaloox253,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"The music plays a big part too, the combat music can even make you wanting to 1v1 with the Sun ! It sets the mood to this game brilliantly.I think the brilliant gameplay coupled with outstanding graphics and innovative story makes it a clear legendary game."
751,Zaribameow22,"Mar  4, 2021",10,"Ikke bare har DOOM Eternal et fantastisk kampsystem og AI, det blander også visse elementer i puslespillløsninger sammen med tarmknusende, adrenalindrevet kamp som helt sikkert vil utrydde alt stress du har og etterlater deg lyst på mer blod og tarm."

Играо сам Доом 2016 и сада, уласком у Доом Етернал, био сам узбуђен и знао сам да ћу доживети ремек дело, али вау, ова игра је поезија. Амбијент, музика ове игре, начин дизајнирања мапе, ток борбе, све је само чисто блаженство које треба доживети. Ова игра вреди сваког пенија. Једина лоша ствар ове игре је та што имају могућност да утишају музику, хахаха. Све шале осим ове игре су историјске."

759,Aboulomania7558,"Mar  6, 2021",10,Doom Eternal building upon the gameplay and level design of 2016. The deeper and more challenging gameplay can be tough to grasp at first but it the payoff is one of the best shooters of the last 10 years.
760,Trevmec1024,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"Игра основана на игровом процессе и дизайне уровней предыдущих игр. Поначалу может быть трудно понять более глубокий и сложный игровой процесс, но в итоге получился один из лучших шутеров за последние пять лет."

764,Patrinkuru1870,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"Buy it. It's an instant classic and one of the greatest FPS games of all time. Worth every penny. Goes to show how good a game can be when it's made by people who love it, respect it, understand it, and most importantly, PLAY IT. Only issues is we need mods."
765,Splenial126,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"Amazing game. Using different weapons/mods carries real benefits this time around because certain enemies are easier to take down with certain weapons. For example, cacodemons are tanky to most weapons, but are weak to the sticky bomb and ballista."
766,Voltinism69,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"The arsenal as been balanced down to the wire, both by weapon tweaks, mods and external factors like the Chainsaw being less of a cheese KO for tough baddies and more of an ammo factory that can be used for an invulnerable state. Glory kills are more varied now, you have more options for tackling various foes, enemies are more aggressive, both old and new. I could go on for days about Eternal, but really just wanted to put a good word in for it."
767,Elapseyer_76,"Mar  6, 2021",10,Blaast het vorige spel op alle mogelijke manieren uit het water. Gevechten zijn veel meer cerebraal en de AI is erg uitdagend. Je moet eigenlijk een gevechtspuzzel oplossen in plaats van alleen het super shotty of gauss-kanon te spammen om alles te bestrijden zoals in het vorige spel
768,Messianism32,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"Upon beating Eternal, especially on Ultra Violence, you may feel confident that you've become good enough at the game.

773,Cybervitcher007,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"One of the best first person shooters (if not the best) from 2020. Frantic action, a huge arsenal of weapons with decent progression and a lot of different levels with a variety of enemies to rip and tear. And good optimized too."

776,Doomerguy1128,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"Overall DOOM Eternal is a damn good time and with its badass soundtrack and fluid combat, its super worth picking this game up. Its honestly miles better than the already AMAZING 2016 DOOM and the game on higher difficulties can be super difficult while giving you a blood pumpingly good time. I highly recommend picking it up if you're into super fast paced shooters."

785,Pugglekaiser64,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"Played the base game along with playing DLC 1 and 2. Its honestly one of my favorite games that I have ever played. The DLC's alone expand more than I could have ever imagined and could be a separate game on its own. It also does not have any micro transactions! You actually earn the ♥♥♥♥ by playing the game on different difficulties through the campaign, gamemodes, and multiplayer. This game proves and serves as an example that you don't need microtransactions in triple A games."

The gameplay feels pretty fluid and taking down the enemies when they are swarming about in an arena like setting gives a gladiator like experience."
788,Kwi_lizard96,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"The Perfect Christian's Game It's time to do the good lord's work and exorcise some demons, via means of a chainsaw and shotgun. While the sequel to the holy grail of FPS games takes a more fantastical tone than it's predecessor, it improves on the gun play to the point where it does for FPS games what its predecessor did for this franchise.Not without it's flaws but the overall experience can be described as pure unadulterated fun. Can we get a moment of silence for the gaming journalists who hadn't been forewarned about the marauder before trying this game? Amen brothers"

794,Srchizo84,"Mar 23, 2021",10,Holy crap this was this game breath of fresh air. Even better than Doom 2016. Probably the best FPS i have ever played.
795,Daniel800,"Mar 24, 2021",10,"At first I was put off by the playful mood and the difference in feel from Doom 2016 but after a few hours of playing I fell in love with the game. Each weapon has its purpose, each enemy has its weakness and its up to the player to perfect their own style of play. I don't love ALL of the changes from 2016 (not a huge fan of the swimming mechanic) but overall an incredible game."
796,Herzog42,"Mar 24, 2021",10,"This is the most intense shooter experience I have had in the last few years.It is so much more demanding and frenetic than Doom 2016, coupled with the blasting soundtrack it is an experience like no other."
797,Gamer600,"Mar 25, 2021",10,The sophistication and fluidity of the combat in this game is amazing. Doom 2016 is crap compare to this and any here claiming otherwise is blinded by nostalgia for that game lol.
798,Nexileo4007,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"its a good fun game, just annoying that you pay for an expensive soundtrack that has a game attached to it."
799,Swinglive67,"Mar 25, 2021",10,"Downloaded and played the Doom previous to this one and its worth playing both, fun game where you can jam out and destroy and kill everything and if you want to make it difficult for yourself you can do that too."

803,Friend5,"Mar 26, 2021",10,"First of all, let me just start by saying the soundtrack on this game is AMAZING. The Best Soundtrack Award is there for a reason. An absolute blast from start to finish and one of the most polished games I've ever played. Visually stunning environments and animations. Immaculate pacing with just the right amount of puzzles/story/lore interspersed between sessions of heart-pounding action that is only enhanced by excellent use of the soundtrack. Challenging enough for every level to be an adrenaline-filled rush but not so difficult as to be frustrating. Same goes for the collectibles, bonus levels, etc — everything is compelling without being intrusive. I was also amazed at how well they managed to capture the spirit of the original DOOM games I played as a kid in a modern format. (For example, I never would have thought that in 2021 I'd be playing a shooter with no reload keybind, but somehow it just works.) Did I mention the game has a great soundtrack? The genre and thematic approach isn't for everyone, but even as someone as someone who typically prefers games with a lot more depth than DOOM has (story-driven RPGs, strategy games, stealth action-adventure, etc) I still loved it it from start to finish. It's easy to pick up and put down at a moment's notice whether you have 30 minutes or 4 hours to blast through hordes of demons. In a time filled with buggy, unfinished, forever-in-early-release, oversold and under-delivered games, it's refreshing to see one so refined and filled to the brim with attention to detail. Overall, an exquisitely crafted game and worth your hard-earned dollar even at full price."
804,Kingbooger94,"Mar 28, 2021",10,"Don't whine about the game, don't whine about the game being too hard, and especially don't hate on the others for not being able to complete the combat loop's. #RipAndTear #NeverGiveUp #ShootEmUntilTheyDie"

817,Bigthorn7,"Mar 31, 2021",10,"A lot has already been said on why this game is masterpiece of an action game. This post is for new players and debunking the garbage negative reviews and lies on this site. I've never seen a game have such weak and poor takes against it like Doom Eternal. 1. Hating on this game for having a more cartoony artstyle really? Doom was never a serious series until Doom 64 and Doom 3. The enemy designs and art style is paying homage to Doom 2 you stupid morons. 2. Second is the muh low ammo. Yes in the start of the you have a low ammo count. The game is trying to teach you to be more cautious about burning ammo like a brain dead moron and is nudging you to basic weapon switching. The game also is guiding you to target weakpoints of enemies. None of this is mandatory its just the game teaching you this stuff in the start of the game hoping that you learn these lessons later in the game. You can still beat this game on Nightmare spamming 2 of the same guns later on but the start of the game really tries discourage players from doing that because that is objectively a boring stupid way to play. You can also brute weapon switch against enemies and never need to target weakpoints because of the insane damage output you can give to enemies. The game has very high skill gap which is a sign of very well designed combat system something you don't see in most games. Once you upgrade ammo, Praetor Suit points in Explosive Piñatas(get ammo from explosive barrels) and Thicker Skin(damage resistance from barrels) this game floods the player with ammo. So this complaint is obviously from people who never actually played much of this game. Also one Chainsaw pip will always regenerate and levels will always have ammo or fodder zombies around. 3. The game forces me to play one way. This is a lie. This game actually has soo many different weapon mod combos and playstyles its actually crazy. Doom youtubers like Under the Mayo still is finding new weapon mod combos 1 year after the games launch. 4. Muh platforming and puzzles. Doom 1 and Doom 2 had platforming and puzzles. Admittedly these games had simple forms of platforms and puzzles due to nature of them being not real 3D games. It wasn't until Quake 1 did id implement vertical platforming. John Cormack and John Romero would have 100% made a level like Nekravol if they had the tech to do it in the 90s. I also don't get it. So do you morons really think walking in a boring corridor for 5 mins is better than more complex jumping puzzles? The platforming is honestly really easy and breeze. The fact that there a people that struggled with it is sad. The purpose of it was to give players a break from the combat(which there is a lot of in this game), allow for more complex level design, and to sharpen the players air maneuverability skills for the large arenas in the game."
818,Midlifecrisis99,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"Bethesda & id have done it again. They've managed to make an amazing sequel to Doom 2016 by building up on 2016 gameplay and adding more depth. The end result: one of the best shooters on the market, and one of the best shooters of the last 10 years."
819,Randomacess8215,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is a 'game' in the purest sense like it has always been, it's about nothing more than going in and having a blast, few games have brought me fun like DOOM has as I've already completed the campaign, and I certainly will replay all of it very soon just because the core gameplay is so much fun!"
820,Jacennor79,"Feb  1, 2021",10,Game of the 2020.Exquisite attention to detail and level design. Perfectly paced. 522 hours in and every Ultra-Nightmare run is still FUN. This game is FUN.Legendary sound track.
821,Midwitowner7341,"Feb  1, 2021",10,Massive action shooter that returned to the roots of classic - you run you kill you rip and tear. Hard day at work? Play this. Your friends left you? Play this on Nightmare. This game is sometimes like therapy session but with heavy weaponry and badass music.
822,Onlyusemeblade9,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"Everything you would want classic DOOM to be, but with modern graphics and technology. Welcome to hell."
823,Skynut9,"Feb  2, 2021",10,"This game exceeded my expectations. I thought it was gonna be a pointless game where all you have to do is slay some demons...BUT this game is definitely one of the best i ever played(now even my favourite), it offers you a large amount of different enemies and weapons. Great music, a pretty decent lore, a lot of secrets, bosses that actually think and the super satisfying/disgusting glory kills."
824,Lacktmp3,"Feb  2, 2021",10,There's not much to say about this title. It's DOOM in a modern jacket and it managed to improve on pretty much everything. Even the music is great.
825,Baincapital666,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Extremely challenging and crushing on ultra violence and nightmare difficulty, but totally manageable and balanced if you know how to play properly. This game will have you spitting out your own teeth and bleeding from your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but you'll love every minute of it."

827,Bluelettermedi5,"Feb  4, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal makes DOOM 2016 seem like a game for toddlers. It's faster, harder and better. There are however complaints which I find overdramatic and strange: ""This is not DOOM 2016"", ""No ammo for anything"" or ""Game restricts how you play"". There are hints of truth in every complaint of course, but only if you do not look at the whole picture."
828,Lizliadlcigs0,"Feb  4, 2021",10,"Gameplay could not have been better. I have always hated playing shooters on harder difficulties, because that would warrant abandoning your balls for the sake of taking cover every second. Here, it is more organic with the movement system of dashing, jumping sprinting around the arena. Every weapon matters and moreso after unlocking certain mods.as enemies require you to use specific ones to take advantage of their weak spots. I do not understand why this is a bad thing for some people."
829,Youmyname343,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms."
830,Champian3,"Feb  5, 2021",10,Doom Eternal cured me of my pathological horniness and has diagnosed me with a habitual anger disorder
831,Keanudeven4,"Feb  5, 2021",10,"Yes, Doom Eternal is much much harder than 2016 for anyone just starting into it. It's an edge lord's game and I say that with a light heart."

833,Richie1345,"Feb  5, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is an epic joyride That I was happy to be on. Doomguy is back to defeat the demons again and save the world but he came with some new equipment.
834,SoundPulse3,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"It's fast paced, challenging yet fair, and full of fantastic design. I've heard people call Doom Eternal a chess match and I can see why."
835,Gyoff7,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"What an epic game. The soundtrack carries action pieces to greater heights and the ambience doesn't hold back punches either. A climbing ladder of constant challenge, new curve balls and constant learning results in a methodical, cheeky dance at the devils door, where everything in the audiovisual department is fuels a spectacle you create by sheer skill and prowess."
836,Frycook2,"Feb  6, 2021",10,I gave up on FPS as a genre quite a long ago. Not the biggest fan of Doom 2016 but this game was way better and much more deep.
837,Bloodsucker666,"Feb  6, 2021",10,This game has certainly earned a place in my top 10 FPS titles of all the time !
838,MKultra1,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"Such a challenging game, but it won't stop you if you'd prefer to take a breezy tour through metal album landscapes and demon guts !!And dont forget to put the difficulty on Nightmare ..."

840,Markchrist3399,"Feb  6, 2021",10,Make sure to have a combat knife to shave with after every play session because you're gonna grow so much hair that you will be able to make a rope out of it to hang demons from the ceiling.
841,Slurpie35,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"Game is super good! I really like the mechanics and effects, also the graphics is suuuper cool and the optimalization is just KreyGasm"
842,Whitewolf93158,"Feb  6, 2021",10,"As a sequel, Eternal is magnificent. It manages to expand without changing what made its predecessor awesome. DOOM’s core remains intact: the gory combat, bloody imagery, frantic pace, and super satisfying gunplay. What has changed is the coating. We’re presented with a new gameplay loop that builds upon that of DOOM 2016. Not everyone will like it, but I sure did!"
843,Darktryaid66666,"Feb  7, 2021",10,Man if this game doesn't get you to beat your meat furiously then I don't know what will

846,Jokerhenchmen04,"Feb 15, 2021",10,The game is like meshuggah album meets Doom 2 meets dark souls. **** absolute dank.
847,Regolith4,"Feb 17, 2021",10,"Positives:+ Incredibly detailed and satisfyingly challenging levels filled with fast-paced shooting, gore and some platforming.+ Beautiful graphics outlining the pretty, gory and sometimes ugly world of Doom. Demons feel as real as they ever have in the latest installment of the series.+ PC optimization is remarkable - the game runs well on a vast range of hardware and even on weaker machines looks and plays surprisingly solid, once again id software does an applausable job.+ Amazing soundtrack to accompany you through the whole campaign.+ A nicely challenging video game, rare thing to say for a lot of 2020 titles. Negatives:- The game has loads of weapons and modifications for each of them. That would be overwhelming to most people I imagine, learning all of them is quite the task, so during my playthrough I used only a handful of them, which work with my playstyle.- Battlemode does not sound that interesting to me, sure you have other players with you, but the amount of demons you get during the campaign would be quite enough. That said I have not actually played it, as the campaign is what matters to me.- The ""story"" is more serious, so to speak, in this one, which doesn't appeal to me and I would imagine it won't appeal to others too. Doom has always been gameplay, AKA slay everything in your way and have as much fun as possible type of game for me."
848,Klaxonster507,"Feb 19, 2021",10,Holycrap this game is amazing. This is the best single player FPS and that I've played in years.
849,Hydrargyrism46,"Feb 19, 2021",10,What is Doom Eternal? Short answer. Pure unadulterated badass demon slaying action!
850,Doucme1243,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"A well executed spin on the shooter genre, that aims to teach both new comers and veterans a different and unique way of approaching encounters, not only in this game, but all FPS out there."
851,Extispicy79,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"It excels at everything the 2016 Doom introduced and pushes that to a highly more adrenaline fuel rush than anything you've experienced before. It's faster, it's bigger and it's more Doom. It's a true blast to play!"
852,Hylactic4437,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"There is far more to unravel in Eternal than just ""here is gun, make demons go boom"". The game requires strategy and reflexes. When you hear that heavy metal music, it's time to fight like hell with both brains and brawn."
853,Misaunter980,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"At first glance you might think the combat is chaotic and all over the place, and truthfully that is how it's going to feel at first because you are just starting to learn ""The Doom Dance"". Allow me to explain. The combat in Eternal is a rhythm of satisfying executed weapon swapping, dashing, jumping and kills that puts the player in a coordinated mindset to always be on the move, shooting and managing ammo, health and armour. And this dance will be learned and understood the more you play. Don't let yourself be discouraged. You will get the hang of the visceral nature of Doom Eternal. It may at first feel the game is forcing you into a certain play style, it's actually teaching you to better manage and control the situations you are faced with."
854,Clinology645,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"This masterpiece of violence is going to be all you're thinking of when you are finally ready to use every tactic you've learned along the way. It's a grand spectacle of fantastic audiovisual communication to the player. The idea that no matter how much you replay it, the game challenges you to invest the time and experiment and use different methods of clearing each arena, proving how well the new formula works where you want to perfect these mechanics because they reward the player and feel accomplished for their effort. Very good game design on all fronts, and the soundtrack is fire!"
855,Juralkbg199,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"Un giro bien ejecutado en el género de disparos, que tiene como objetivo enseñar tanto a los recién llegados como a los veteranos una forma diferente y única de abordar los encuentros, no solo en este juego, sino en todos los FPS. Sobresale en todo lo que presentó el Doom 2016 y te impulsa a una descarga de adrenalina mucho mayor que cualquier otra que hayas experimentado antes. Es más rápido, más grande y más Doom."
856,Huiupavis333333,"Feb 19, 2021",10,"Walka w Eternal to rytm satysfakcjonującej wymiany broni, skoków, skoków i zabójstw, który wprowadza gracza w skoordynowany sposób myślenia, aby zawsze być w ruchu, strzelać i zarządzać amunicją, zdrowiem i zbroją. Im więcej grasz, tym więcej się uczysz i rozumiesz, jak tańczyć. Nie zniechęcaj się. Dowiesz się o instynktownej naturze Doom Eternal. Na początku gra może wydawać się, że jesteś zmuszony do przyjęcia określonego stylu gry, w rzeczywistości uczy cię lepszego zarządzania i kontrolowania sytuacji, z którymi się spotykasz."
857,Anoesis90,"Feb 21, 2021",10,"Purists will say that the difference between this and the original Doom series is so wide that this blurs the boundaries of what game you can call Doom or not. But hear me on this, I DON'T CARE! This game is like Quake and Painkiller both better games than original Doom or **** tier Doom 3."
858,Adoxography954,"Feb 21, 2021",10,"I'm an FPS vet. Old school. I remember when Elite was a bunch of black and white lines on a tv screen. Our imagination made up for the shortfalls. We don't need to any more. And Ive waited so long for games to look like advertised. Stand anywhere in Doom Eternal, stop and look around you. Look at the sky, the clouds, the floor. Look at the detail, design and layout. Don't take it for granted. Looks like hell on earth!"
859,Stadial836,"Feb 21, 2021",10,"This looks beautiful, it really does and every credit to the devs. 10/10Gameplay on the harder skills is tough as nails, you'll be swarmed by enemies and weapon switches can't come fast enough. Bind your weapons properly, it'll be fine, trust me. It reminds me of Serious Sam, Quake, Unreal Tournament 2004 all rolled into one."
860,Oneiric60,"Feb 21, 2021",10,"If you liked DOOM 2016, then DOOM Eternal is going to satisfy you. There's some slight differences and some new mechanics that make it feel more modern. While I prefer the old school style of DOOM 2016 for the simplicity, Eternal is still an amazing addition to the series."
861,Gauleiter425,"Feb 25, 2021",10,"Amazing graphics, intriguing lore and story, topped with gameplay that has the perfect mix of challenge and fun make for easily one of the best games of 2020."

863,Diestrus56,"Feb 25, 2021",10,"This is such a great game, it does improve on everything that Doom(2016) did while also introducing a lot of new mechanics that makes it really worth getting."
864,Algicide693,"Feb 25, 2021",10,Game is simply a masterpiece. Same as Doom 2016 in fact even better. Love it.
865,Bluser_Cuckoo1,"Mar  6, 2021",10,"The best fps i've ever played, i've played for hours in offline mode because my internet sucks, but it is one h e l l of a challenge. get this game!"
866,Doxdy31746,"Mar  7, 2021",10,This game is fantastic. The gameplay feels even better than DOOM 2016. The story is good but I wouldn't necessarily say it's the reason to play this game.
867,Codon_car129,"Mar  7, 2021",10,"You must learn your ways with every weapon and move quickly and efficiently in every fight, or else, the demons will swarm and overwhelm you pretty easily. Dual shotguns won’t always be the best combo (sorry DOOM 2016 MP :P). Demons have different weaknesses and exploiting them is the easiest way to succeed. And even knowing all that, you’ll still need quick reflexes and some level of trigger discipline to get out alive of most of its combat."
868,Pale_Tumid84,"Mar  7, 2021",10,"Very challenging, very fast pace, very well optimized, beautiful. I recommend you to play in Ultra-Violence for more badassery."
869,Fossaquark205,"Mar  7, 2021",10,"I liked Doom 2016 aesthetic better but as overall game Eternal is better. Gameplay, movement and level variety is soo much better."
870,Naruhota,"Mar  8, 2021",10,"Good game, from the gameplay, introducing new weapons and enemies, to the soundtrack, it's just a good game. To go in deeper, this game starts off regular into intense with a lot of enemy's, and you unlock new weapons and the game wants you to keep adapting and you feel like your getting stronger as you start defeating the larger enemy's in less time and then you get introduced to even bigger enemy's. Also, there are puzzles to solve kinda like a strand-type game with platforming and having power-ups like extra lives, and every enemy that you kill can rather give you an armor boost, more health, or even more ammo and more. The story is also engaging and good."

880,Solidsnake852,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"Best shooter I have ever played. Hands down, the best action, movement and feel for a shooter.One of the most awesome soundtracks. Solid gameplay with mechanics on glory kill==health, chainsaw==ammo, fast movement and different feeling on the various guns. Adding the crazy platforming and battle maps that revolve around movement and fast pace and you have the best action shooter probably ever at the time of this writing. Plus lots of demons to squash, shoot, cut, maw, explode in many different ways!"
881,Capnlyssa920,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"Easily one of the best FPS I've ever played. Great visuals and performance. Information is communicated clearly to the player even in the most hectic of fights.

901,Kajolica395,"Mar 21, 2021",10,"There are pros and cons with Doom Eternal. I really enjoy the story arc of Doom eternal and the map design is well done. The missions challenge the player to come back and continue to gain more skill as well as to explore the levels. I also enjoyed the challenge of the Ancient Gods Part 1 expansion pack. However, When I played the Ancient Gods Part 2, It was not as challenging as I had hoped. Especially the final mission and boss fight. I was expecting much more of a challenge for what the objective was. I encourage the team at Bethesda to increase the difficulty of the second campaign expansion."
902,Feokl22,"Mar 21, 2021",10,"Вы продадите душу дьяволу, чтобы пройти эту игру на кошмаре. Особенно дополнения Ancient Gods. Там без святой воды вам не справится уж поверьте."
903,XenSakura,"Mar 22, 2021",10,"Very fleshed out gameplay loop, detailed and interesting environments, intriguing story that raises questions, satisfying and interesting gunplay and interesting enemy design which Doom is known for.

904,Fakewater95,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"Perfect timing for stay-at-home! Love this game. Combat is amazing, graphics are great and movement is smooth."
905,Moox54,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"- proper sequel to Doom(2016) - super tight movement, the addition of the dash mechanic is one of the reasons which makes this a superior experience compared to its predecessor. - map design is out of this world, incredibly fun to roam around. - game runs super smooth and seems very well optimized"

908,Lordheckburger3,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"Excellent combat. One of my most enjoyable gaming experiences. Even after completing the game, I needed to go back and replay the levels so that I could unlock as much as possible. On top of all of this, the soundtrack really completes the game. Now I can tell my friends about the great times that I had slaughtering demons while headbanging!"
909,Venergance74,"Mar 23, 2021",10,One the best games in recent memory. The levels are really cool. Combat is amazing.
910,Yaysie23,"Mar 23, 2021",10,Easily the best single player FPS ever invented. Throwing cover out the window and heavily embracing a brilliant system where you gain health by killing enemies... I have never had my heart race with such intensity while gaming. Each kill animation is a delight to watch. This is my 2nd time purchasing DOOM ETERNAL (I had it originally on ps4) and its so much tastier on pc. DAMN WHAT A SPICE!
911,GreatChronic42,"Mar 23, 2021",10,"If you're looking for a solid single player shooter that will help you become better at shooters in general once you learn to work with the game rather than against it. Look no further. From a community that is normally very helpful(some not so great nerfs kind of has a fire under the communitys ass atm) to the AMAZING Developer team that always has an ear to what fans are saying. Doom Eternal has outstanding audio design and the visuals will take you from breath taking beauty to stomach turning horror while always looking pixel perfect no matter where you are ripping and tearing. I have MANY hours played in this game and im yet to touch the multiplayer mode so that should speak for itself on the replicability of the game. Pure fun all around, definitely would recommend to anyone at any price. If you are fortunate enough to see this game on sale, don't be a fool."

It forces you to think, but also gives room for a lot of creativity once you learn how to use your tools. each level is beautiful and the shooting feels amazing. I really recommend it for people who love skill based shooters. I also suggest coming in with an open mind. There are a lot of mechanics to learn but the game does a good job of teaching you with tutorials (you can turn them off if you want to, but I suggest playing with tutorials on for first time). the tutorials are short and do a good job of explaining the mechanics. Once you get in to the gameplay loop and get in the zone it feels amazing to play and I haven't played a shooter that was so much fun in a long time"

927,Facontroller74,"Mar 24, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal isn't just some random old first person shooter you see publishers funding month after month. It isn't some modern military shooter. It's a puzzle game - nay, a rhythm game disguised as an FPS. That rhythm being a quite literal chainsaw metal soundtrack carried by the game's immaculate level design. The enemy design is the strongest I've ever seen in a game. Each one offering something completely different and unique opportunities to destroy them. Every arena is a glorified flowchart where you're assessing your ammo, health, and armor reserves at every given moment. Not to mention the dozens of demons that are always in your face, ready to be shot at. Doom Eternal is a masterclass of modern video game design and the best non-VR FPS to have ever been made."

932,Hudrewudre60,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"Its Great, At first I could not handle the chain gun + flamethrower + grenade + dash + supershotgun hook at the same time and quick weapon switching but this changed with some time. The arachnotron (spidey thing) was a challenge one of the first big enemies, 20 hours in and I crush it. Same thing with the maurauder as soon as you learn how to bait his vulnerability state/attack move he becomes easy and then when you learn how to quick weapon switch he is done. His wolf will be no issue after your aim and timing is dialed in. I really enjoy the collectibles. You can get a suit upgrade which shows you the locations of them. This negates the need for a tedious Youtube Video or not if you can't solve the puzzle. The parkours are hard at first small deviations from the required movement lead to failure but latter your timing is right and you will swing like tarzan. These pakours also help later in combat. They learn you how to move correctly and how to don't miss a ledge. It is great to overcome these hard challenges."

936,TitaniumDragon,"Jan 16, 2021",8,"DOOM (2016) was a game that took the “old” formula of FPS games and reinvented it for a new era. DOOM Eternal takes all of what DOOM did, and builds on it – for better and for worse. The core combat is excellent – you are encouraged to be constantly mobile, with a broad variety of enemies rewarding you for taking a variety of different approaches and using different tools in your arsenal. You are encouraged to both fight at a distance, to fight at midrange, and to fight up close by various different enemy types, which helps to mix up combat encounters and keep them fresh and interesting. You have a chainsaw and a flamethrower, the former of which lets you instant-kill enemies for more ammo and some health and the latter of which gives you armor, as well as your glory kills – badly injured enemies start flashing, and you can rush in and do a special kill on them for a bunch of extra health (and if they’re on fire, armor as well). But at the same time, many enemies can do a lot of damage up close, so you are rewarded for moving in, taking out some foes, then moving back out again, using cover to absorb ranged attacks, before moving to a new position to lay down more damage. You also have a pair of grenades – a frag grenade that does damage, and a freeze grenade that freezes enemies in a large area – along with a “blood punch”, another upgraded melee attack that you get by glory killing enemies, resulting in a powerful attack that can severely injure or kill demons and give you a bunch of health drops. In the endgame, you also get a sword, that instantly cuts any non-boss demon in half (and even some miniboss demons), though it has severely limited ammunition. It can all be a bit much to keep track of sometimes, but it ends up rewarding the player for mixing up their gameplay, and not just falling into the trap of doing the same thing over and over again. You have eight weapons, each of which has two alternate fire modes, and almost all of them are very useful against particular foes, rewarding players for using all their weapons – something I really like seeing. The eighth weapon, the BFG, has a second “mode” that is actually a separate weapon in the same slot, both of which use the BFG ammo – a rare drop, but it makes sense, as the BFG can wipe out most enemies in a single shot, while the other weapon can lay down heavy damage very rapidly as well. The only downside of the combat system is that the higher difficulty levels mostly function by making the enemies more bullet spongey and making you take more damage. While not the end of the world, it can make enemies a little on the annoyingly damage soaky side in Ultra-violence mode, the second highest difficulty level, and you can die pretty fast. That said, the combat is pretty well-balanced even on that mode, and I made it through the entire campaign without changing the difficulty level or using the optional temporary powerup sentinel armor, which serves as a means of helping players who get stuck. Still, there were some encounters (particularly optional ones) that killed me repeatedly, and some of the bosses were a bit frustrating. Indeed, the second to last boss was a low point of the game – while cool visually, the boss primarily functioned by making the ground do damage. While “stay out of the bad” is a classic boss tactic, it is less fun in a FPS, where you have a restricted field of view – doubly so given that the boss flew overhead, so the “bad” was not visible from your FOV on the ground while shooting up at her. However, apart from a few niggles, the combat was pretty good. The same cannot be said about the rest of it. The game has a story, but the story is confusing, as it does not pick up where DOOM 2016 left off, but some time later. Moreover, it just isn’t very good – the DOOM Slayer is not much of a character, having no dialogue, and mostly just seeming rather angry. Other characters talk AT you, but it isn’t very interesting. Moreover, what plot IS there isn’t particularly interesting even apart from the main character – it feels a bit generic fantasy, which is doubly weird given it is a sci-fi setting. The DOOM Slayer brushing off the story in the first game was funny, but it didn’t work nearly as well here, because they were more intimately involved with the goings on, the plot being more important but also more confusing and mediocre. It is even more awkward considering one of the levels is pretty much entirely story content, and while it finally makes the story make more sense, it doesn’t actually make the story GOOD. As a result, I’m left feeling like this was a pretty good game, but it was far from perfect. It improved on DOOM (2016) in a number of ways, but also took a step backwards in others."
937,Woantmsoap9,"Jan 31, 2021",10,"I believe there are two types of games: those that strive to send a message, and those that simply aim to entertain the player. DOOM Eternal belongs to the latter group; not that there’s anything wrong with it - quite the contrary. Because it excels at it."
938,Rippingtearing6,"Jan 31, 2021",10,"This game frantic relentlessness is often exactly what I'm looking for in a modern FPS.

All in all, it's a fun little game despite some imperfections here and there (one of them being the platforming) which don't manage to ruin the game if you're looking for some action and challenge.I highly recommend making a collection of the entire franchise because it's not only a classic but it'll also teach you to overcome your fears. You won't regret it."
944,Irondoom9,"Feb  1, 2021",10,"Playing it delivers the same cathartic craze the original Doom and Doom II did in the early '90s: overwhelmed by the horrors around every turn, but empowered with an impressive collection of weapons at the ready. But the new Doom is louder and faster than the old model. Its battles ask more of you, and its heavy-metal soundtrack causes your body to quiver from turbulent surges of adrenaline. From the outset two things are made immediately clear: you were born to kill demons, and you'll do anything it takes."

But Eternal you kill demons (Which I think is very appropriate) and not people! Why would you want to kill good hardworking individuals that have wives and kids?

957,Victorianera923,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"It's the raw cerebral intensity of Quake married with Doom's enemy roster and its violent, cathartic attitude. Enjoying this game requires a certain frame of mind, a certain willingness to push yourself and to think in the heat of the moment. But it's extremely rewarding if you meet it on its own terms. Nearly every weapon feels like it has a significant role, a stark contrast to Doom 2016's promotion of 2 weapon playstyles. Ammo counts have been massively reduced, pushing the player towards intelligent use of their loadout. Overall, the way I would describe this difference is that Doom 2016 treats its weapons as a set of toys, in which any can be used at any time without too much consequence. Doom Eternal treats them as tools, and you have to use them well to achieve success."
958,Fatcat931345,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Epic game with hyper-intense gameplay loop of constant movement, weapon swapping, and decision making.

962,Basedgod35,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Yes, there are some definite differences between Eternal and 2016, but nearly all of them are for the better. Combat is even more visceral, and while it may at first feel the game is forcing you into a certain play style, it's ACTUALLY giving you more control on how to manage resources. You have to play smarter, but you can also remedy any situation far easier than in 2016. Need armor? Cook em. Health? Stab em. Ammo? Saw em. It's so straight forward but very satisfying at the same time. And after experimenting a bit with weapon loadouts, you DO NOT have to use sticky bombs or zoomed rifle shots to disable demon weak points. It is preferable because it's much faster, but I was able to disable their points with different weapons or completely ignore them entirely, by overwhelming them with firepower."
963,Henirch900,"Feb  3, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is a masterpiece. id software (ID) has stuck to the same 27 year old formula that PC gamers fell in love with on MS DOS, and continue to improve on it with additional game mechanics, an upgraded engine, and new demons of Hell to slaughter while listening to excellent heavy metal music."

974,Kirill_Klimov,"Feb 17, 2021",9,"[DOOM Eternal: Fast and Furious] DOOM Eternal is a role model for all shooters that aspire to create an engaging and challenging experience for gamers. As a side note, it is important to mention that difficulty settings play a crucial role in the game because their adequacy to your gaming skills determines whether you would have a positive or a negative impression from the walkthrough. Conversely, the story is not the strongest part of the game; no, let me put it differently - the lore is quite rich and thought-through, but the game lacks in the ability to present this lore to the player in the appropriate manner. Be that as it may, DOOM Eternal is perfect in what it was designed for, that is - shooting and killing hellish creatures, both from the shooting perspective per se and its platforming entourage. For performing the demon executions, the protagonist a.k.a. the Doom Slayer has a plethora of different “devices”, ranging from shotgun and rifle to rocket launcher and ballista. Some say it is even possible to get the iconic BFG (however, unfortunately, I did not manage to obtain it). The platforming, in its turn, is not overwhelming but convenient and fun, thus presents itself as a cool addition to the main mechanics rather than as an obsolete burden. As a result, the seamless combination of the shooting and platforming helps to create a captivating gaming experience, not letting the player get bored. Nonetheless, for such an amazing “degustation” of the game, the choice of the game difficulty is paramount. Should you set your settings too high - and you risk ending up bogged up in repetitive grinding to get the necessary improvements without which it is pretty damn reckless to move on. Or, there is a possibility that one battle arena or some boss would prove unbeatable on the highest difficulty settings (dear speedrunners, not everyone is as talented as you are); hence, the frustration might even prevent an overachieving player from actually finishing the game. On the other hand, the easiest difficulty level is, well, too easy. Namely, there is never a shortage of ammunition, health and armor, and extra lives continue to pile up because a hard enough challenge never occurs. In this scenario, the possibility of leaving the game unfinished is also quite high because where there is no challenge, there is no excitement. In brief, I would recommend opting for the difficulty settings somewhere between the two extremes. A blot on the landscape - the story presentation. In my opinion, this aspect of the game is pretty weak. I mean, the cutscenes and short dialogues only present the story to the player on a need-to-know basis, like “here is your enemy, kill it”. This situation is pretty ironic because the game lore itself is worth looking into but is hidden under a large massive of text in the “codex” page. Yes, I know, DOOM is not an RPG with a divaricated dialogue system and a possibility of making important choices that influence the course and the ending of the game. And yes, maybe too much story would distract the player from holding on to what the game was initially designed for, that is slaying “alternatively alive” monsters. I just think a little more context would be in order. In any case, DOOM Eternal is a solid piece of gaming art, one of the best in its genre and, with the right approach, could deliver a cornucopia of emotions, ranging from anger and sort of “ambitious powerlessness” to exhilaration and happiness after clearing another stage. Even without knowing exactly why you need to do all of this stuff. 9 out of 10"

991,Montredbow1,"Feb 25, 2021",10,A new era for FPS shooters. Getting better at this game translates to all aspects of getting better in life. trust me on this...
992,Gynandroid4,"Feb 25, 2021",10,"After playing this for 1 hour I fired my boss and grew a beard Seriously, this is the most fun game I've ever played. The combat is faster than The Flash's season antagonist and the platforming is actually fun (it's sort of a rest from the combat, which does get tiring after a while). 10/10"
993,Pickdapoop24,"Feb 26, 2021",10,"Recommended, the same fun you will get from Doom 2016 but even faster. Little piece of advice, try to play the Doom 2016 first and then Eternal, it gets hard to return to the speed of the game from 2016 after playing Eternal."

1000,Yede_tigg57,"Feb 28, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal é a prova da destreza de tiro em primeira pessoa da id Software. Ele mantém o que fez DOOM 2016 um jogo tão amado, enquanto também corrige seus problemas; a variedade de níveis é maior e a jogabilidade é agradável até o final - ao contrário de 2016, que se tornou repetitivo nas horas finais. A seleção esmagadora de sistemas de atualização e seções de parkour incongruentes não são solicitadas e são um pouco estranhas, mas adicionam sabor à mistura e não prejudicam sua experiência. Se você gosta de jogos de tiro em primeira pessoa, DOOM Eternal é uma compra obrigatória."
1001,Yuniac58,"Feb 28, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal ist brutal, rücksichtslos, unbarmherzig und bedingungslos brillant. Ich hatte nicht erwartet, dass das Spiel so gut wird, und es hat mich von Anfang an umgehauen. Die Musik, der Kampf, die Geschichte und die Überlieferungen fallen zusammen, um ein Meisterwerk eines Spiels zu schaffen."
1002,Glorehole3,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"I have played 245 hours of Doom Eternal, pretty good so far. I might need to play it more to make an accurate assessment."

1004,Citizensnip7924,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"The over-the-topness of it all really adds to the overall experience of DOOM and the story, although rushed, is VERY fun and interesting. Of course, you're not playing DOOM for the story... The weapons, abilities, modifiers, enemies, puzzles, etc. etc. are what make this game as fun as it is. You get a plethora of enemies to fight ranging from the ones you know and love to kill to some new ones that have not been seen in a DOOM game yet. The weapons are all pretty standard DOOM weapons but they feel so... good in this game, that part's hard to explain."
1005,Acyrology974,"Mar  1, 2021",10,"I got about 17 hours out of this game. 20 at the time of review because I wanted to go back and get all the ""things"" I also tried the MASTER levels - SUPER fun but *MAN* I wish this was Co-op.... I did not try the multiplayer, nor will I ever. Look, if you like DOOM, this is a MUST HAVE."

1019,Ruf_bee_zy701,"Mar  7, 2021",10,One of the most well optimized games I've ever played! Always awesome to slay some demons. Beautiful world and character design. Only thing is even with the DLC its a bit short. Still a blast though!
1020,Bouncingmelons6,"Mar  7, 2021",10,"This game is great if you're willing to learn it. If you want to stick to play an overrated braindead shooters go ahead. Actually, don't even play DOOM games anymore if you'll act like that."

1029,Serigraphy5239,"Mar  8, 2021",10,"The game is one of the most funnest ive ever played. I love the demons designs, as well as exploring the lore, doing puzzles. Its more than just a fighting game, it is THE fighting game."

However, the way the checkpoints work, I can do a fight over and over again until I'm satisfied with how I managed to solve it. So if you're good at FPS games, you'll have plenty of opportunities to shine. If you're not but you have the fighting spirit for it then mission by mission you can claw forward."

1043,MrPajamas,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"DOOM (2016) brought the series back to life, so I waited for what the sequel to DOOM would introduce us to, this time with the subtitle Eternal. In short, DOOM Eternal improves everything from 2016. Right from the beginning, we have a view of our hero, who puts on a mask and doesn't keep us waiting too long and throws us right into the action. After all, this is supposed to be the case, and as I mentioned in the review of the previous part, DOOM, in my opinion, has never been so much about the story and it was mainly an event. Friends ... how to describe it. The action is here ... PHENOMENAL! In the previous game, I slightly complained that it could have been even faster and I got exactly what I wanted and even more! Weapons of luxury, as in the previous game, we just got a new toy in the form of Crubical. Ladies and gentlemen. Mowing these demons was indescribable. In addition to this news, there are others and one, oooh. The one thing ... that completely changes the game and that's DASH! Dash will give you the opportunity to move much faster and so the whole event is even faster, faster and even BRUTAL! We have added new animations in the game, and believe me, that's a different cut. How creative the developers were and what possibilities we massacre the Ememak. In short, the new glory killy is an ABSOLUTE gem, and imagine that the HELL SOUNDTRACK is playing into it. Overall, you feel unstoppable. The player feels that he simply has incredible power, or at least I perceived it that way. It is also worth mentioning the boss fights, which were already luxurious in the previous part at the time, but are several times better here. Locations have also undergone a change. Are we no longer only in hell, but also on Earth, in winter biomes, or even in heaven or where the hell are we? I admit that I don't know myself, but it doesn't matter, because I would just use spoilers unnecessarily and I don't want that. It is possible to spoiler here, because there is again a story, which this time is not harmful and in my opinion is much better than the one from the previous part. The developers simply found a kind of sweet spot dosing action and cut-scenes. Of course, there are also improvements. One of the novelties that players don't praise about the game twice is the jumping passages. Personally, I didn't mind, but for some it was a matter of slowing down the action and unnecessarily stretching the game. I personally disagree. The action here is unbelievable and has such a pace that it just won't let you breathe. So I could somehow calm down all the adrenaline in these parts, where you just jump. Well, I think I praised the game so much, so it's probably no surprise that I think it's a perfect FPS and an excellent game, which I recommend to both DOOM series fans and FPS fans in general."
1044,Easlin795,"Mar 12, 2021",10,DOOM Eternal improves upon just about everything that the first game set in motion.
1045,Flangio64,"Mar 12, 2021",10,Melhora quase tudo no jogo anterior. O único problema é onde estão os mods?
1046,Neochell97,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"The movement is fast and precise and each combat encounter progressively becomes more and more like a ""Dance of Destruction"" than the last by incorporating new, unique demons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The beginning stages of the game are plagued with ""the purple goo"" and tentacles that disrupt the flow of the game, but are much less common in the later levels when DOOM Eternal really comes into its own. A fast, aggressive joyride with some really cool retro-arcade mechanics are what to expect in Doomguy's newest title."
1047,Ontocyclic35,"Mar 12, 2021",10,Absolutely incredible from start to finish. Challenging but too much fun to put down.
1048,Hazelwolf123,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"Very action packed game, recommended if you like fast action gameplay. Good stuff."
1049,Slayerpro118,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"I used to be terrible at this game, a lot of deaths in Ultra-Violence. After practice, learning, and having a great time, finishing Ultra-Nightmare was fun. Events to keep players with fancy skins and other awesome stuff, gives this game more replayability."
1050,Fafrak25,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"Oh man. This game is so good that I can't even... The bonus is that it runs extremely well on Linux and even a bit better than on Windows(like 5-15 and my gpu is not that hot which is weird?) at the time of writing this review.Do I recommend it? Yes, but be warned that Doom 2016 is going to feel so slow compared to Eternal."
1051,Toastedcrayon12,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"i usually like to post joke reviews but this game is to good for that there's so much depth to the combat, the movement is great, the guns feel fantastic, the environments look fantastic, and it is very very well optimized. on my GTX 1650 it runs at 80-120 FPS on high settings and 120-144 on low settings not to mention the game still looks great at low settings. The platforming is pretty decent it's not amazing platforming but it's simple enough to never interrupt the pacing, it actually helps the pacing by working together with the exploration in between fights to give you something to do in between arenas rather than just walking. great game don't listen to the games journalists who claim it's boring. (also the ancient gods dlc's are good too)"
1052,Lemonke60,"Mar 12, 2021",10,"Even more fun than the already great Doom 2016. Well-optimized, iconic soundtrack, much more variety when it comes to both demons and the slayer's movement in comparison to the previous game, a bit more story oriented while still not keeping the aspect too dominant. I'm not too fond of fps games, but this one's perfect. My only complaints - platforming can get quite annoying from time to time, and the multiplayer mode is a bit lacking (but still, who buys a doom game for the multi!)."
1053,Chilltronic104,"Mar 12, 2021",10,This game is absolutely fantastic. I have over 100 hours in the PS4 version as well.

1060,Forclaz47,"Mar 13, 2021",10,Very good game. Close to masterpiece! Fast and fun. Good heavy metal / demonic setting. An over the top story that make me laugh. Shooting action like I have never seen before.
1061,Methuselah23,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"Slaying demons to heavy metal music. What more could you ask for in an FPS?In all seriousness, the game design is just incredible fun. They make you feel powerful while also appropriately challenged. The smoothness of mobility and combat is awesome. The animations, environments and attention to details really reflect the love and care this dev team put into the game. They improved on nearly every aspect of the first game and made it better. All around awesome."
1062,Coletremayne666,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"Cannot rate this game highly enough! Amazing! (pro tip, drop all audio to 30 and keep music at 100. Awesome sound track for ripping and tearing)"
1063,Moyedroblox8,"Mar 13, 2021",10,"Runs very smoothly on non recommended specs, i get 90-120 fps. Very good game, I am very surprised on how well it runs, very good game yes yes."
1064,Solostarian537,"Mar 14, 2021",10,Turn out the lights get pumped up and kill some demons to save the world. All to the score of awesome heavy metal music. Whats not to like.
1065,Larviparous82,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"Limitations inherent to game's rules (being it stricter ammo limit and bigger emphasise on cooldown-based abilities and mobility) actually promote creativity and technical skill of using different tools and weapons - if you don't believe me, compare videos of how the game was played at release and how it's played now, how less popular mods and weapons caught second wind when players start experimenting with them. Honestly despite being more punishing Doom Eternal has much more variety in combat than 2016. But it all takes learning and getting used to, player has to suffer for some time to overcome the entrance barrier and get into a mindset and skillset where the game becomes incredibly fun and some people just don't want to put time into the game to get there, which is completely their right."
1066,Ghostman2407,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"Este es sin duda el mejor juego de disparos que he jugado en mi vida, es hermoso, las canciones son una combinación perfecta, las armas son divertidas."

1068,Farrier904,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"The only quarrels I have with the game are:1. The glory kills get repetitive over time.2. Occasionally you'll get cornered in some way that you can't really recover from, and the amount of health you have means you sit there panicking for about 15-30 seconds (depending on the situation) before you die.Aside from those 2, the game is amazing."
1069,Drnebula5,"Mar 15, 2021",10,Where do I even start with this game? Among us but with demons and hell. Its hot.
1070,Badasscowboy21,"Mar 15, 2021",10,"At first I thought there is too much violence, but then I managed to realize that it's a well-developed game with a great storyline. Play at least 4 hours and you'll get the hang of it."
1071,Panda36,"Mar 15, 2021",10,Played a good 7 hours but from everything i saw and did it looked great and based off many videos the game is easily a 10/10 BUT. you HAVE to be aware that you need an up to date PC for this game. i had to refund it because i couldn't play past 15 frames. it is a very demanding game for PC hardware.
1072,Dom007,"Mar 16, 2021",9,"Very enjoyable for the most part. The combat,level design and graphics are its strengths and it's soundtrack is very good as well. Some of the levels could have have been shorter though and it's story also could have been a lot better."
1073,Tom3730,"Mar 16, 2021",10,I would recommend this game since it is full of nicer. In fact it's absolutely jam packed with nicer. Some would say its a nicer overload. I would say its Olidi.
1074,Grugfat288,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"The game itself on any difficulty is a gem. DOOM Eternal for me is tied with 2016, in my personal opinion its better in alot of ways too, but i know others hold 2016 closer to themselves. Its a HELL of a lot of fun in whatever mode you play having lots of different ways to play as well."
1075,Saltysugar89,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"I tried playing DOOM (2016) after playing this, and this game is infinitely better and worlds above the standard of all FPS games I've seen."
1076,Itsmelvan48,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"At first I thought Doom was a horror game and oh boy was I right. It is an horror game, for the demons. Best Single player FPS game I have ever played. Worth every single Euro I have spent on it. Such an Amazing game."
1077,Juice106,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"Did you just get off work? Are you pissed off? Did you just nose blast a rail of that sweet Columbian good-good? Then this game is for you. Yeah overall it's great if blasting demons is your thing, and you don't want the hastle of a deep story that you have to pay attention to."
1078,Woog420,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"Very fast paced gameplay, although the game does throw a lot at you in terms of abilities and upgrades, although once you get the hang of it, very fun game to play."
1079,Gigvanity696,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"I love the HELL out of this game. There are some aspects of the Doom immediately prior to this that I love. The simplicity. However, I feel that Doom Eternal is in general a much more challenging game. The action in this game never ends, and the music is fantastic. The visceral deaths feel so good in this game, and there are so many ways to kill your enemies. Weapon modifiers are well thought out and most of them are practical. Doesn't feel like your wasting your time upgrading your gear, and on top of that the game has weekly challenges keeps you coming back along with cheats that you can add to the game to change the pace of things. It's worth it. If it's on sale please buy it, you won't regret it."
1080,Quink_nitch140,"Mar 16, 2021",10,"PROS- Another absolute banger. The base game has some really amazing tracks and even though the DLC music was composed by different people it all fits into the gameplay like no other. - The enemies. Every enemy has a place and a reason to exist on the chess board. Some are incredibly punishing like a carcass up close. Others are just fodder meant for ammo or armour. But they all fit beautifully into the Doom dance. Even the Marauder. Just watch Under The Mayo's video about him if you're unable to confidently figure out a way to get through him. He's nowhere near as bad as others have made him out to be. - The shooting. Every weapon is fun to shoot, responsive and impactful. Enemies are pulled apart with the new gore system and no weapon feels underwhelming or useless. - The controls. Doom guy controls wonderfully (especially when you get the rune to control yourself in mid air better) and zipping around the arena with your dash, swinging off poles and meathooking yourself into the air is incredible. The sense of speed never feels like too much. - The combat. On Nightmare the enemies are relentless. This is where the Doom dance shines. You will likely have to get used to quick switching weapons, constantly flame belching, ice bombing and glory killing to stay alive. In 2016 moving in 1 direction wouldn't result in much of a punishment. In Eternal you have to be moving in all directions to properly avoid being hit and I love it all the more for that. Using your chainsaw as an ammo refill was a neat little addition that I personally grew to love a lot along with the flame belch for armour refills. - The visuals. This game looks even better than 2016. The vistas are incredibly, textures are higher, enemies are designed to look more closely like their original sprites and the detail on them in terms of textures and animations is top notch. - The performance. No game performs like Doom does whilst looking this good. I've never had frame drops from too much happening on screen nor have I ever encountered slow downs from too many enemies spawning in at once. Truly remarkable how well this game runs. Playing this on ultra, at 144hz at 3440x1440 is amazing. CONS- The story unfolds in a very expository manner. Entire concepts that doom guy would already know about are spoken directly to the player instead of being shown or leaving that information to a codex for those who care to read about it. - The crashing. I have had several crashes throughout my time and have never been able to figure out why. At 1 stage I played about 16 hours without an issue (my first playthrough). Then I had about 4 different crashes over about 10 hours of gametime. Just recently I've been practicing some Ultra Nightmare runs and it hasn't crashed once. Its been very inconsistent. - As of 16 MAR 21 you will likely encounter issues with the bloodpunch and chainsaw. The bloodpunch will sometimes not activate at all or you'll have an enemy highlighted orange for a glory kill but you'll blood punch it instead. With the chainsaw you could be closer than you actually need to be but have the game not register the attack and flash ""no target"" or you'll get the same message flash up if you try using it against a demon thats in the middle of some animations. The latter instance is inconsistent in of itself though as I've managed to chainsaw many imps whilst they were leaping between platforms. - Ground attacks from certain enemies have a tendency to activate infinite tracking at times. I've had some attacks fall short as I dashed backwards. Others rounded corners and somehow followed me into the air. It doesn't happen often but its frustrating when it does. - Conclusion: An amazing fps/action game"

1105,Strangealien300,"Mar 30, 2021",10,"Okay so after finishing the game 2 times,First on Please don't hurt me and second on Ultra-Violence It is time for a review! Should you buy this? Yes, overall it is Doom.Price might be a little bit high but it gets decent on sales. Okay let's get to the point! PC Requirements: Decent (At least 3gb GPU and a decent CPU) Graphics: Graphics are nice! Comparing Lowest and Highest graphics they look similarlike a difference between 2 graphic options next to each other in an order. What actually changes islighting quality, reflections etc. (which can be up to 6,7gb vram starting from 2.7gb vram) Sound design: All I can say is BEST MUSICS and Most seducing death, slaying, demon (and more) sounds Bugs, Glitches: There might be some that people encountered before but I finished the game peacefullyin my both 2 gameplays. Load times: it is not instant load, but it is nice. Story: They tried to do something, good cinematics and plenty of opportunities to see the Doomguy. How long? 25 hours Gameplay: it is nice and Fun beside some anger issues sometimes for some levels, but you must be moretactical instead for just shooting around like you have to first destroy guns of demons, make cacodemons eatbombs or use specific weapons on specific demons. Always have an eye on how many ammos you have, you will have to use the chainsaw so many times that you can't even imagine, now little demons are a source of ammo to use yourchainsaw on. About the fighting arenas, they are nice mostly, besides some odd wall placements letting you being surrounded and die (only a few designs like that). About some cons now: (weapons to be used: Super Shotgun, Ballista, Bomb) Marauders, the new enemies. They are hard if you are too far they use their super shotgunor send a wave with their axe made of argent enery, if you are too close they might wield their axe on you. Keep middle range dont attack in random times, they might use the instant-wielding shield and you will lose time reloading your super-shotgun giving you a death risk, so always attack when he is about to attack. If you are low on ammo/health, be rapid go chainsaw/glory kill or bloodpunch some little demon and get back to the fight. (you are not always encountering them but they are tough) Doom Hunters, they are dangerous until you destroy they rocket down there in the legs part. This rocket gives them a Plasma Shield and increases strength. After you destroy the rocket with Shotgun's minigun mod, rocket launcher or minigun(any tough weapon) he is now very weak and you can chill! So that's all for my review, it is overall a very nice DOOM experience like always. I give it a 10/10"

Really good game with some lore but not too much, many well made demons, many fun to shoot guns with many modifications, graphics are really good, you don't need NASA computer to play on highest settings, so it's well optimized, everything is just well made.The only bad thing is multiplayer, it's not as good as single, but I am reviewing singleplayer, because it's the whole game, multiplayer is just an addon."

1220,Model_Jb300,"Apr  1, 2021",9,"This is the fps of genre, you better listen to this you p*ssy. DOOM Eternal is my another favorite single-player fps, and i'm in love replaying this over 4 times already. DOOM Eternal take place after DOOM 2016 ending (I'm not going to spoiled it, go see for yourself and play DOOM 2016 what is happening at the ending) over 66% has been consumed by the demons. DOOM Guy and VEGA going to work their way and Rip and Tear. The intro is already a badass. The game go straight right in to the action. No more bullsh*t pistol. Pistol is ruining the pacing on DOOM 2016. In DOOM Eternal, you start with the Shotgun right away and go for 1, 2, 3 shot at the Zombies faces. And then, there is the chainsaw. Chainsaw has a ability to drop shotgun ammo, heavy ammo, cells ammo, and rocket ammo. I don't know why people are complain about ammo because of the shotgun clip size was originally for 20-30-40-50-60 max from DOOM 2016. DOOM Eternal's shotgun clip size will give you 16-18-20-22-24. In my opinion, id Software did a good job balancing the game and not to give this game more repetitive. It was a good changes. I don't want to hear you guys give a sh*t about an ammo changes! Press C for ammo bi*ch! Character model has been overhaul for the Classic DOOM looking. example for Soldier have bright orange eyes and dye green hair. Cacodemon blood was originally from red blood to blue blood. New and return of the enemy from DOOM 2016 : Lost Soul, Hell Knight, Baron of Hell, Mancubus, Cyber-Mancubus, Imp, Soldier, Cacodemon, Pinky, Spectre, Cyberdemon (was renamed for Tyrent), Cueball, Prowler (from the multiplayer of DOOM 2016 and now he was from the actual the first time in single-player)  and Revenant . The return of the demon: Archvile, Pain Elemental and Arachnotorn. BUT WAIT I'M NOT DONE YET! There is new demon in this game. Carcass, Gargoyle, Whiplash, Dread Knight, Mecha Zombies and Mayker Drone. We are on to boss fight you encounter: Doom Hunter, Gladiator, Khan Mayker and the gigantic Icon of Sin. I forgot something I'm I? Oh yeah. Marauder, this is the only enemy can hurt the pacing if you are new to DOOM Eternal. He can dash, summon a wolf. deploying his shield for his arm, throwing axes, and shotgun if you stand to close. For real, he can kick your a**. He is tough and annoying. Expert DOOM Eternal player like me. You have to keep Marauder at mid range until eyes flash green so you can deal damage to him. Marauder can even block your shot, I mean like block everything, he also dash way if you throw a grenade and ice bomb ("

1228,Robinjhoe,"Jun 12, 2021",9,"Basically what a game should be. It takes the foundation of doom '16 and builds up on it with more movement, more demons and more everything. Though sometimes it feels a bit ""too"" much, for what it wants to be, but i would be nitpicking at that point. Id Software have really shown  what it means to make a game that takes a few mechanics and fleshs them out as much as they can, with concentrated, thought-out levels. Maybe a bit too much platforming. Fantastic presentation with an insane soundtrack. The story basically puts you through 14 hours of endless, gory, wonderful, never-ending action. So if you like fun and fast shooters this ones the best in years."

Back on ground dash like madman to dodge incoming fire meathook again onto relevant. Let go of the hook to fly in air precision bolt, supershotgun, flame fire and than ballista to kill it seconds. Back on ground again freeze barron of hell with ice bomb. Blood punch, flame it, switch to full auto shotty attachment, baron of hell unfreezes but heavily damaged dash quickly to chainsaw nearest fodder demon, meathook onto baron of hell and let go to fly in air.

1235,Swordfish8k,"Aug  5, 2020",9,"Has some of the best combat in the entire action genre. Constantly moving non stop action makes you feel like you are on a rampage. Doom eternal does not pull any punches either the game is difficult especially near the end but the difficulty curve is also sloped in a way you naturally get better so that you are ready for those killer parts at the end. The only thing holding it back is the game will often slow down in between combat encounters, parts that could be taken out entirely and the game be better and the final boss feels gimmicky."

Also storyline is nonsense and very forgettable whereas original game story was very simple but still believable and effective."
1241,VDMueren,"Jun 21, 2020",10,"[NO SPOILERS] DOOM Eternal is an instant new classic. The developers focused on everything that made DOOM (2016) so great and took them to a whole new level, removing what did not work. Guns and progression are more balanced. Gun mods are remade and more fun to use. Hell levels can look more cartoony, fiery, and uninspired if compared with those from 2016, sure - I miss the brown, bloody and creepy look of Kadingir Sanctum, Titan's Realm and Necropolis - but the maps are now much larger and work better with the new rhythm, which thanks to the more limited ammo and new flamethrower and chainsaw system, is even more fast-paced. DOOM (2016) almost feels like a sandbox game right now. The new-introduced dashing mechanic works really well, and the platforming is just at the right amount, making your movement across the large open arenas feel like dancing with the devil, almost literally. It sets up a new FPS sub-genre at its own. For a lack of a simpler term, it is a retro-arena-rhythmic-frenetic-survival-metal-first-person-shooter. You won't be able to blink for the most part of the game. You won't be able to simply shoot at demons whenever you want and using whichever gun you want ignoring the ammo and health counters. Disobey those rules and then you are lost. If you want to take it easy, just play the previous game, it's fine. This game is made for those who want to feel like they REALLY are DOOM."
1242,EdgarMttz,"Jun 22, 2020",9,"Esperaba con muchísimo hype DOOM ETERNAL y la verdad yo considero que la espera valió cada maldito segundo, el juego es muchísimo mas frenético que su precuela, la historia es buena, pero no esperes un guion súper epico, porque no lo es, a pesar de que dijeron que el juego duraba lo doble que DOOM 2016 puedo confirmar que no es así, de hecho dura un poco menos, pero esto se compensa con una mayor cantidad de secretos, una rejugabilidad buenísima, un battlepass y un multiplayer que está 2/3 Si tengo que ponerle un pero al juego sería que una vez acabado el juego no se libera la munición de la BFG en todos los niveles como SI sucedía en DOOM 2016 y el Crisol también lo usaremos MUUUY pocas veces"
1243,oxyloged,"Jun 22, 2020",10,"Quite simply one of the best fps games ever made. This sequel is not afraid to push the envelope and evolve the gameplay but it does so while remaining respectful of the original. Combat now feels like a clockwork machine polished to perfection, run, jump, shoot, stab, jump, run, shoot, chainsaw, stab, grenade, jump, flamethrower, bloodpunch, jump, run, stab, it all blends together seamlessly and once it clicks, you find yourself at the centre of a beautiful whirlwind of ultra-violent destruction. The enemies are more threatening, the arenas are more dangerous, everything is bigger, better and faster than 2016. Several classic designs are also back for several monsters, weapons and items.The game isn't perfect, the early levels especially are not particularly fun as your health and ammo are severely limited and you don't have all your tools yet. But if you get past that, this is an incredible game and and an amazing experience. This game is most definitely a hard 10."

I have over 100 hours in the game and I am still enjoying every second of it. Some of the new mechanics and enemies take some getting used to, but once you are familiar with the game it's really, really fun. There is more story than previous Doom games, but I like it and some of the levels/story are really fascinating. This is one game which I cannot wait for the DLC! I really want more Doom!"
1246,Dhendro,"Jun 24, 2020",10,Played it so many hours. It was great and a whole new experience compared from doom 2016
1247,JumpingWolf,"Jun 24, 2020",10,"The user score is too low, possibly due to the mess that involved Denuvo anti-cheat for a week or two. That's no longer a problem, and the score needs to go up now. DOOM Eternal presents a beefy campaign for a modern shooter and raises the violence levels to over-the-top extremes. Multiplayer is unique and interesting. On a high-end PC, the game looks beautiful and obviously sounds orgasmic. The game's sound effects are awesome and make everything feel more satisfying. The soundtrack is metal af and nearly perfect. The single-player is a rare treat, offering about 30 hours of gameplay in one shot provided you search for all the collectibles. There are so many different demons, and the game ramps up the difficulty naturally, with the only unfair spikes happening if you take on the Slayer Gate challenges as you come across them. Enemies have weakpoints that you can exploit with certain weapons, all of which are fun and satisfying to use. Use equipment like grenades and flamethrowers to sustain yourself with armor and health pickups, and use the chainsaw to replenish your ammo. Ammo runs out quicker than it did in DOOM 2016, but the chainsaw is easier to use this time, adding to the mayhem. Harder difficulties result in more intense pulse-pounding action, and I do recommend setting the difficulty to Ultra-Violence to start. Doomguy moves fluidly by jumping and dashing, and he can hit enemies up close with the powerful, crowd-controlling Blood Punch. There are so many layers to the combat it's insane, and the demons you encounter will all have different optimal ways of dispatch. The progression system is nice and fun to partake in, though some may be turned off by the requirement of a Besthesda.net account. Multiplayer is fine but it isn't the game's selling point. While graphical fidelity in the game took a big hit when Devuno-anti-cheat was added, you can still occasionally see low-res textures if you stop to gaze at a wall up close. There's also plenty of lore in the game to get lost in, but some of the codex entries are laborious to read when I just want to get back to the action. Besides that, I do highly recommend this game. It's a whirling dervish of exhilaration for anyone who loves the idea of popping demon's eyes out of their sockets and thinks realism is for squares."
1248,Ulfhedinn,"Jun 24, 2020",9,"Thoroughly enjoyed playing this to 100% completion. Reviewed as single player only for now. Pure joy to play, more Doom 2016 with enough change to refresh. I grew up playing almost every Doom game (ports to consoles missed like PS port) and definately played every PC version as well as many WAD's and total conversions. This is still Doom, only slightly different, but still good. Just play it and have fun. Rip and Tear"
1249,dasert,"Jun 25, 2020",10,Amazing experience people may say its more cartoony and arcade like but i will disagree there is more violence than ever which is what fans asked for a lot more air movement and the only way to get anywhere in the game is to use all the tools at your disposal which takes practicing resource management and skill.
1250,Killtocure,"Jun 26, 2020",8,Takes some risks gameplay wise adding some questionable design decisions regarding certain enemies and platforming/jump puzzles. Overall it's still doom.

1258,Intense_epic,"Jul  6, 2020",10,This game is the best video game iv'e ever played.It brings the intense gameplay from 2016 and cranks it to 11.The game also doesn't let you use the super shotgun the entire game and makes you switch weapons which is a big problem in most games that id was able to fix.The movement and platforming is so much fun and the secrets are so cool to collect and will please any hardcore doom fan.They really made this game into a masterpiece by keeping the cartoony feel of the 1993 doom and mixed it with the intense gameplay of doom 2016 and made it more intense and fun.Every one who says it's bad because of the story or the new gameplay has no idea what doom is about or is the reviewer of cuphead who couldn't get past the tutorial.Doom was never about the story it was about fun and if you like the lore in doom id wrote pages of lore you can collect and read.I don't want id to think they made a bad game because of all these normies.Id if you read this keep it up and don't ruin doom by listening to these reviews.
1259,Socotroco,"Jul 11, 2020",10,"This game is amazing, it is the perfect mix of strong music, testoreno, violence and a great story behind I can not find fault, it is full of secrets from its graphics and enemies I loved it, it is a game that amuses you and makes you want to spend it With twice the difficulty until reaching the ultra nightmares, I loved the section that you can even narrate as a story and it will work."
1260,absolutelywtw,"Jul 13, 2020",8,"When it comes to common arguments against Doom Eternal, it’s always about low ammo capacity and forced ways to deal with demons. Sure, id could’ve just made Doom '16 2 and be done with it. But they went the hard way. Let’s quickly examine it. In Doom ’16 there’re no limits on ammo, so creativity shouldn’t be limited, right? Well, the thing is you would end up just using Super weapons, with occasional weapon switching and chainsawing. But you probably gonna get Rich get Richer rune and forget about chainsaw and other weapons whatsoever. Game doesn’t encourage you to use other tactics, so why would you? In DE with ammo limit you’re punished for using only one weapon exclusively. But you’re encouraged to mix them (and their respective mods) in combat. Once you start doing it, ammo stops becoming an issue. Seriously. But then what about weak points? Aren’t they contradicting the intention to experiment? Here’s a thing - it’s only recommended way to deal with demons. Sure, you can always throw a grenade into Cacodemon’s mouth. But you can also kill it with charged Ballista shot OR use Ballista + Rocket + SuperShotgun combo OR even keep it alive so you can flee from dangerous situation with meathook. It also applies to other demons as well. Once you understand all of it, only then you’ll start enjoying Doom Eternal. And also find out that it’s better that Doom ’16. Oh, and story is whatever, and Battlemode’s netcode is rubbish."

This isn't  a generic fps, and requires meticulous mastering of mechanics and systems to complete on the hardest difficulty.  This creates the potential for a power fantasy like no other, as whilst the hordes of demons feel threatening, with time you can develop into the most  OP killing machine that ever existed.  Plus they got rid of the real demonic invasion that was Denuvo anti-cheat. Winning."
1264,PMS_Jordan,"Jul 21, 2020",8,"Doom Eternal is a fantastic, fast paced, great shooter. When they added the anti-cheat system DRM into the game I was very upset since it was kernel level based and you needed it installed even for single player. However, I 100% appreciate the devs listening to us and removing that from the game. I highly recommend Doom."
1265,GezVares,"Jul 22, 2020",8,"The game-play is the best part, it's really well polished and thought out, so fun in fact I find myself going through the maps in the campaign over and over just for the thrill of the fast paced and diverse combat system evolved from the previous title. If you want a challenging game that forces you to think creatively and react fast, while also providing you amazing visuals, sound design and music, this is the game for you. My only complaints are with the story and some decisions with the art direction. The story seems totally disconnected from where it was left off in the previous title, the places and characters we interact with indicate that there's a lot of missing steps to this plot, almost like we skipped many chapters to get to this point and no context is provided further than a general recap of the major events between the previous game and this one. When it comes to the design choices for the graphics, I don't like the approach of sacrificing immersion for the sake of levity and clarity, like items floating in mid air and the generally soft, toy looking designs of some demons and locations. This gets worse when compared to the previous title, which had a more grounded approach to it's visuals and environments that locked you in a believable science fiction. In contrast to that, DOOM Eternal seems like it doesn't want to be taken seriously. Overall this game is absolutely it's worth in time and money just for the attention to detail when it comes to the combat and learning curve. It's a game I would recommend to my veteran FPS friends as well as somebody who never played a video game before, since I could never come close to express how much fun I've been having with it."
1266,max_monk,"Jul 23, 2020",9,Good old school DOOM. I played with my younger nephews all weekend. It gave them a lot of joy.
1267,jordanlearmonth,"Jul 24, 2020",10,"Let's just start by saying that this is a fantastic, exhilarating, and brutal FPS. As someone who had not gotten into DOOM before this, I was a little concerned with what I would think, but I loved it. I'll break it down into a few categories: Gameplay, Story, and Aesthetic.Gameplay: This game is so incredibly fluid. The controls make it easy to bounce around the battlefield and destroy demons every step of the way. It's easy to change between weapons, use equipment, and chain together attacks to wipe out the demon hordes. The bosses are challenging, the secrets are fun to find, and slayer gates provide a unique challenge with a promise of reward upon the completion of them all. The only downside that I found is how intense it can be. It's a game that I enjoyed playing for a couple of hours, taking a break, and coming back to, as opposed to grinding it all out in one take. That's just personal preference of a casual gamer though, your experience may differ. 9/10Story: As I said, this was my first DOOM experience so I didn't know if I would be engaged, but I loved it. The amount of lore hidden around the world was amazing, and truly brought the player into the world of the Slayer. I know some people disliked the use of cut scenes in this game, but I thought they were a pleasant respite from the action and helped to flesh out the story, especially if you didn't feel like reading all of your Codex entries mid-game. The Fortress of Doom also made the character feel more real than I was expecting. 10/10Aesthetic: Beautiful, brutal, grisly fun all around. Being able to see the damage done to individual demons is incredibly cool, and adds a pseudo-health bar that is so unique. the environments are massive and well thought out. I truly enjoyed looking at this game as I played it and took time to take in the scenery. Plus the music is so intense and perfect for the feel of the game. 10/10Overall, this is a fantastic game, well worth the money, and has huge replay value as you try to collect everything, play with the cheat codes, and master the game. 9.5/10"
1268,gbzmr,"Jul 31, 2020",9,"Doom returns after the success of the 2016 reboot and proves it is still possible for a sequel to learn the right lessons from its predecessor and evolve into a new chapter that is greater than the sum of its parts. There is a decent story that the game tries to tell, with some excellent voice acting and impressive visual set pieces.  However it definitely takes a little bit of a backseat to the action – which I think is a fair compromise for how incredibly well the gameplay is executed. Right out of the Hellgate, Doom Eternal wastes almost no time arming you with new mobility and equipment options unique to the sequel in order to acclimate you to it’s break-neck pace combat ecosystem.  Within the opening hours of the game you gain the ability to dash twice in quick succession, swing off horizontal poles for extra air mobility, set your enemies ablaze to produce armor drops, and launch hands free frozen or classic frag grenades.  There are more tools you pick up later on in the game, but this moveset is gained relatively early and becomes absolutely essential to carving your way through each mission in a shower of blood and a face-melting soundtrack. Though the amount of abilities and keybinds you are required to use on a moment to moment basis may feel intimidating at first - the rhythm of combat is something that becomes second nature to the player thanks to the stellar pacing of Doom Eternal.  You never spend too much time staring at a puzzle trying to figure out a solution, or wasting time backtracking because you are unsure of where the game wants you to go.  And as the missions progress, so does the variety of threatening demons in each new encounter.  As enemies get more and more aggressive, you learn that your best chance at survival is to use the arenas to their fullest.  When combat is in full swing, the amount of decisions-per-second the game requires from you is probably one of its most attractive elements.  Choosing when to launch a grenade to either obliterate pursuing foes, or create an opening ahead of you to get to that staggered enemy for a health replenishing glory kill.  Do you use your frozen grenades to create space to focus your effects on a bigger foe, or pick the upgrade that increases damage to frozen enemies to shred through a group with a few well placed rockets?  Remembering where that clutter of lesser demons is so you can double-back with your flame belch to easily restock some armor.  Do you equip the ability to give you reduced cooldowns on grenades, or the ability to refund dash charges on glory kills for a quick run in/run out heal amidst the chaos of a Marauder smacking you around the room.  All of these decisions are being made constantly through some of the larger fights, and coming out the other side victorious is pure adrenaline. Doom Eternal is best when playing at whatever difficulty pushes back the most, such that you are almost always about to die – but don’t.  When attempting the first mission on ‘Hurt me Plenty,” the game felt more like I was passively viewing the level play out rather than fighting my way through it.  Bumping up to Ultra Violence made it so that every fight I entered was not guaranteed victory.  The excitement of playing Doom is at its highest when you are constantly fighting for every inch you gain throughout a lengthy combat encounter. Managing cooldowns, chainsaw fuel for ammo refills, and frantically trying to create a glory kill opportunity when the game beeps in your ear as soon as you are at death's door is absolutely thrilling.  Every single time I came out of these battles bloody and beaten – and every single time it felt like I became a better player. Playing Doom Eternal was easily one of the best first person shooter experiences I’ve had in years.  It made every other shooter feel like it was running in slow motion.  If you are a fan of the fast paced twitch-shooters of old, you are guaranteed to have one Hell of a time here. Final score:  9/10"
1269,Royciphusleee,"Sep 12, 2020",10,"the game is not for sensitive, it does not guide you like other games and the story is quite good. In addition to making you aware of spending the ammunition you have, because it is the most precious thing you will have."

1274,De2nis,"Aug 12, 2020",10,"It took me a little while to warm up to this game. Early on, it irked me that forces you to focus a lot on arbitrary, non sensical mechanics: for example, chainsawing enemies to get ammo. Demons infighting is unnecessarily frequent. And I missed tearing enemies apart with my barehands.But once i met with my first jumping puzzle, I started to warm up to the game. Its a sophisticated experience that challenges you in so many ways. It's not the simple pointing and shooting of Call of Duty, or the mindless catharsis of Doom 2016. It's a really brainy, challenging experience.Soon my warmth became red hot. As another reviewer aptly said, you feel like an unstoppable force of nature. But what's truly a pleasant surprise is the story. When it comes together about 75% of the way through the game (after seeming disjointed and confusing), it's actually something incredible, and serves to answer an important religious paradox in a very edgy and powerful way.Doom 2016 was mindless catharsis. Doom Eternal is so much more."

1292,BenzoSt,"Nov  2, 2020",9,"The combat in this game is faster, more sophisticated, and just plain better than it was in DOOM (2016). The level design is more varied as you will travel to many locations over the course of the campaign. The sound effects are better and the music continues to get me really-super-pumped. Codex entries you find throughout this game describe a backstory of epic-ness.  But I have three minor grievances: first, the artistic tone was less grim and morbid than DOOM (2016); second, I didn't enjoy all the wall climbing and bar swinging; and third, I think there should have been more power-ups like Quad Damages and Berserks scattered around the levels."

1297,medal_of_honor,"Nov 17, 2020",10,"Best Doom game after Doom 3, Doom 2016 was too basic for my taste, but Eternal is really good. All my favorite demons are back."
1298,Disko-Kjell,"Nov 24, 2020",9,"From every aspect of this game, it grabs you by the balls and does not let go until you've desimated every enemy exisitng in the game. It's a beautiful mixture of explosive mayhem and elegant coordination resulting in a game that stands out. The primary focus of the game lies of course in the campaign. When it comes to gameplay, it refines the already great combat from Doom (2016) with some added features. You still run and gun with immense traversal features at your disposal.Many weapons from the previous game return, like the combat shotgun and the insanely powerful ballista, but a hand of new ones introduces themselves. Amongst the arsenal lies the plasma rifle and the Unmaykr, a holy weapon using bfg ammo to annihilate any species coming in its way, which can only be accessed by completing the Slayer Gates. But not only that, onto the super shotgun is now introduced a grappling hook, allowing for fast movement by attaching yourself to enemies, which makes the already fast gameplay even faster.Adding to all this is new enemy types as well, which allows for more intense encounters. Many classic enemies from previous Doom games make a return, like the basic soldier, the flying Pain Elemental and the daunting Arch-Vile, while new ones also debut, like the shield creating Carcass, fast paced Dread Knight and snake sounding Whiplash. All enemies from Doom (2016) make a return (with even a mini version of the Cyberdemon and the Spider Mastermind), except for the Summoner. Boss encounters introduces even more enemies. The Doomhunter is a power house, consisting of cybeorg technology and a lot of health to make your day worse, which later becomes a common enemy through the game. The one stage bossfights test your skills to the action, resulting in intense one on one fights. However, the enemy that stands out the most is the Marauder. Representing your counterpart, the Marauder moves fast, deals heavy damage and can block any attack you launch at him. It is only when his eyes flash green and he goes in for an attack that he is vulnerable to your strength. His design shuts down the player's ego, resulting in an enemy in need of total focus to defeat, almost remeniscing a martial arts fight between two masters. He works different to all other common enemies in the game, working as a building stone to defining you as a master at the game, almost how main characters in movies meet an enemy that punches them to the ground. Through pain and sheer perserverance, you learn to fight him like all other enemies, and he becomes an incredible part of the roster.All of these factors result in a combat experience much faster, more aggressive and more brutal. The game also intesnifies its difficulty. Simple punches of enemies is not going to do the trick (unless you use a blood punch), so focus lies on the arsenal. Since new gameplay options are introduced, the level design has to compliment the speed, and here the game definitely delivers. The only gripe with the design (which aslo lies in most FPS games) is that you sometimes get stcuk on an enemy, and in a game like this you do not want to stand still and lose a lot of health. Outside of that, the developers did an amazing job. The art direction is supreme, with every level and place feeling huge and marvelous, inciting magic to every location the game takes you to, which also is helped by the insane graphics elevating these destinations to beyond epic boundaries. The soundtrack has a return from composer Mick Gordon, rocking out even more than the last game, thanks to incorporating more groovy guitar riffs, heavy techno filters and introducing a heavy metal choir(!) to help the grand scope of the game's aesthetic. Mick Gordon has knocked ot out of the park one's again. As to story, the game has a big adventure, but much of the information lies in codex entries scattered around the levels, and what is shown is either hard to follow (unless you've read the codexes) or uniteresting. While the story has some bright spots, it could've used some more cooking in the oven, since the game focuses som much on the plot.Outside of the singleplayer campaign is also a multiplayer, introducing battlemode: A game mode where one person plays as the Slayer, while two other people control one demon each, creating a 2 VS 1 experience. The multiplayer is entertaining and refershing, reflecting the intense gameplay of the singleplayer, and surprisingly balanced, but it's missing a vast erray of optional game modes to keep the fanbase engaged in the gameplay. If Battlemode was introduced along side classic game modes, like team deathmatch adn capture the flag, the multiplayer would be better off and even more emphazised by the players, but I can still see a community building around the multiplayer.All in all, you definitely get your bang for your buck with Doom Eternal. This is a secure purchase to anyone who is a fan of the first person shooter genre. Rip and tear until it is done!"
1299,maomeowmoo,"Dec 12, 2020",9,I did not play the first doom very much only 2 hours. Doom eternal on the other hand i played and beat it. The only problem i have with this game is the length/replability of it. Once i beat it(17.4 hours) i did not feel the need to play it anymore. I bought this game for half off and for that price it is 100% worth it
1300,pcschmidt00,"Dec 18, 2020",10,"By far the best FPS I've played and improves on DOOM 2016 in pretty much every way. The gunplay was satisfying, the music was banger, and it's just full of content. Only main gripe is a few rough difficulty spikes here and there"
1301,Chomaiden,"Dec 22, 2020",10,"The story is not relevant but it is understandable since it is not the focus of the game, and even so, it fulfills the function of making you feel like a badass in the role of the Doomslayer.Do not be fooled by the first hours of play, once you progress through the levels, you get more weapons, and improvements that make the game a playable delight. No weapon is too many, each enemy has a weakness that requires a different weapon, which motivates you to use all weapons and improve them, which is an incentive for exploration to look for improvements, tokens and suits, which by the way, the levels They are very well done, so those slowdowns do not feel forced at all, and they are a pleasure thanks to the clever platform design and a few puzzles that, while easy, are still entertaining. The ammunition is more scarce than in the previous one which forces you to use the chainsaw intelligently. I would have liked to see more boss fights, but the truth is that the ones that exist are very well done, in addition to the fact that the construction of each level and the appearance of new demons makes the game not feel repetitive at all, even despite that there are not so many bosses.The game also has secondary levels and challenges that offer playable rewards and high replayability, and by itself the campaign is fun enough to make you want to replay it on another difficulty, in fact I liked the game so much that at the time I played on PS4 and now that I switched to PC I bought it because the game is worth it.If you like frenetic games that force you to use all your resources and think fast, this game is worth every peso even at its original price, and if you catch it on sale, do not think twice, buy it."

1303,reviewmassa1920,"Dec 30, 2020",9,"A helluva good time.  Addicting gameplay that requires some (not a whole lot) strategy.  Ammo is at a premium so you'll be switching guns a lot, certain demons require specific combinations to make it effective etc.  Just a flat out fun game to play.  Game throws a lot of mechanics at you (i never played the 2016 version) but before you know it you'll be zipping around destroying things.  Not a tactical cover shooting game and will take a bit of practice before you're on autopilot but then it starts to click and it becomes a violent ballet.  Oh and that soundtrack, just the cherry on top."
1304,EpicGamer1999,"Jan  1, 2021",10,"I'm fully convinced this is the best FPS ever made. It's uncompromising and radiates confidence in its design. It makes every other single player FPS game look primitive in comparison (including its 2016 predecessor), kind of like what Devil May Cry 3 did to action games. Just incredible depth and flow. Players who are slow to adapt and have scrub mindset tendencies neet not apply, it will eat you alive."
1305,HighTechGG,"Jan  3, 2021",10,"Nem tenho palavras para expressar, o jogo está ótimo, mais frenético que nunca e muito bem otimizado, incrível. No meu Acer VX5 I5 GTX 1050 roda 60 FPS Full-HD gráficos no alto. inacreditável. Como seria bom que todos os jogos fossem tão bem feitos assim, na jogabilidade, otimização e imagens. Parabéns..."
1306,1nvas1on,"Jul  9, 2020",10,"The Game was great i enjoyed it throughout the entire campaign, i disliked a bit the game forcing me to switch weapons however it was handled pretty good to compensate for it."
1307,ComedianPlay,"Nov 19, 2020",10,"Господи это лучшее во что я играл. Люди, которые хейтят игру, просто тупо нубы и не могут привыкнуть к большему количеству механик и более динамичному геймплею. Единственное что мне не понравилось, это тупорылый и бесящий мультиплеер, если бы добавили ароме батлмода еще и тдм было бы вообще идеально"
1308,ldj,"Nov 21, 2020",10,"This is everything a sequel should be. Almost every aspect of the game has been expanded. The combat is more intense and demands your full attention, this is a good thing. Movement and traversal are now more dynamic with the addition of double dashes, the meathook, and monkey bars. The new ways of movement make the platforming especially easy and forgiving since you do not die when you fall. I love how the boring method of combat by using only using one gun, like in DOOM 2016, is obsolete. The game encourages you to play in unique and and creative ways because of how different each enemy plays. Weapon switch combos are a thing glory because the game rewards the player for managing their ammo economy well. This is an experience best played on mouse and keyboard because of how fast you have to react to chaotic situations. The is also noticeably more brighter than 2016. I think this is a good change because you can more clearly see enemies, health drops, or ammo. It would be unfair if arenas were took dark and you got killed because you could not see a particular enemy. My favorite demon to fight is the marauder because you cannot engage him like other demons. Weapon switch combos are mandatory against him and a skilled player who knows the game well can cheese the marauder a matter of seconds. Like all the other demons, the marauder is smart, he won't just charge at you blindly and swing his axe around like a mad man. He wish dash around and punish the player for getting too close. BATTLEMODE is also really fun because it bring the Slayer experience to multiplayer. This unique 2v1 game mode promotes cooperation between the demon players while they try to out smart and trap the Slayer. No demon player can brute force against a Slayer. I love it when a game discourages the easy and obvious route to success. I wish more game developers adopted this concept into their games. There is also a fantastic modding scene who create new and interesting ways to play. A horde mode mod and custom master levels were create to appease the most skillful of players. For those complaining about the cut scenes, just hold R, you can skip them."

1310,Cidor,"Nov 24, 2020",9,"This game is very dynamic, and in my opinion this is the main advantage of the game. After completing Doom Eternal, I decided to replay Doom 2016, and after playing it a little, I found that it was difficult for me to play it - it looks slow after Eternal, and the weapon somehow feels worse ... However, in the new Duma there are several things that I have a complaint about. First, there are endless hints. As soon as you meet a new serious opponent, the game tells you how to kill him. WHAT??? WHAT FOR??? Shouldn't the player figure out the best way to kill the monster? But it's okay ... THE BOSS IS THE SAME! The game tells you how to defeat the BOSS! There is no excuse - the game keeps you like an idiot. And the second complaint is filing. If the last part was like science fiction, then this one looks like a fairy tale. We find the weapon floating in the air (in the previous part, we took it from the dead soldiers), everywhere there are some fire chains, like in Mario, and you can continue indefinitely. It looks somehow inappropriate for me, strange ... But nagging can be found in almost any game, and what I have listed is not very significant, in comparison with the coolest dynamic gameplay"

1315,Clewless,"Dec  8, 2020",10,"I get why some people don't like the fact that you have to constantly be utilizing your cool down abilities to have enough ammo, or health to survive. I had this same problem when I started the game where I was constantly running out of ammo, but once I realized I'm supposed to be using my chainsaw in every encounter to replenish my limited ammo, I started **** loving this game. Granted, I also really like games like Overwatch and Titanfall 2, which play in a similar way. The graphics and the music are also top notch. It feels like a ""next gen"" game to me."
1316,hughjphgames,"Dec  8, 2020",8,"Great game to play through, good fun for slaying demons. On the other hand, the story is fairly confusing, this is probably as much to do with poor communication of the story to the player. After playing the final levels you do feel as though you have accomplished something even though you're not really sure what. However, the graphics, music, and general feel of the game are really good and overall the game is just a load of fun slaying demons in hell. Recommend to anyone when the game is on sale!"

The guns, the sound, the music, the atmosphere, is outstanding. The graphics are pretty good for a 2020 game and the story was fairly palatable. I've said enough. Go play the game for yourself, I highly reccomend it, 9/10"

If you're pondering on buying it, you should get it. even on ultra nightmare, my PC is still hitting a clear 60 fps even though i don't even have a good graphics card. Right now, it's also in sale on steam for 20 bucks, and that was when I bought it. Overall, amazing graphics, intense gameplay, and a good story."
1324,AKAILP,"Dec 15, 2020",10,"Es prácticamente perfecto, la versión de PC tiene aparte mucho mimo y simbolismo por parte de los desarrolladores.Gráficamente es algo superior a su antecesor, no cuenta con raytracing o DLSS pero aún así luce muy bien.A nivel de soundtrack es magistral, prácticamente todos los temas son excelentes y muy memprables.A nivel jugabilidad es lo mejor que ha habido en años, no solo es disfrutable a mas no poder,transmite ese sentimiento de que tienes el control y que eres prácticamente imparable.A nivel de rendimiento es simplemente un trabajo impecable, no solo está increíblemente optimizado, también te permite ajustar cualquier parámetro hasta el más mínimo detalle mediante la consola del juego.A nivel narrativo no es muy destacable, pero se agradece que termine cerrando incógnitas que se originaron desde DOOM 3, aparte de agregar mucho al lore y dar una faceta más humana al Doom Slayer.El multijugador es peor que en la entrega anterior, no es malo pero es un paso atrás.Lo más destacable es que el juego sigue recibiendo contenido, tanto gratuito cómo expansiones de paga, es de agradecer que las mejoras no se reserven únicamente a quienes pagan una cantidad extra para adquirir la expansión, que también vale mucho la pena."

1326,Presher,"Dec 17, 2020",10,"One of my favorite games of all time. After completing Eternal Doom 2016 feels slow and easy. I finished the game + DLC on Nightmare diff but for the first playthrough I recommend going for Ultra-Violence which is challenging but forgiving, very balanced. Performance was great, even on my 6 y rig, visuals are amazing, sound design is just the best. Doom Guy is like a super hero in this game and you can see that right away in the opening cinematic. Environments are rich and unique. Modders have already made a lot of fun mods like horde mode. Developers support the game and it's obvious they are passionate about Doom. GOTY for me."
1327,ThatGuy845719,"Dec 20, 2020",9,"I'm going to preface this by saying, I've played the OG Dooms. They were one of the first games I ever had the experience of playing. So when 2016 dropped, followed by Eternal, I was ecstatic. On release day, I installed, beat & 100% the Campaign in one weekend; because that's how much I love the Doom franchise. As for Battlemode, I honestly never played or plan to play it. To me, Doom is about the Campaign, not the Multiplayer; even 2016's. Campaign is amazing, and while the now more challenging or arcadey aspects will turn some away; it's just as good as 2016. If not, better."
1328,BlackBleach,"Dec 21, 2020",10,"Very good! Love the Gameplay, the Story and the visuals. 10/10 would recommend"
1329,Oinkster,"Dec 22, 2020",10,"I have never had this much fun with a shooter. The story is beautiful nonsense that serves as a brainless vehicle behind the bombastic levels and I just love it for that. The gameplay has had more toys and mobility options thrown in that can make it feel a little overwhelming. Yet, once you have mastered the flamethrower, double jump, bar swing and weapon mods it becomes a delicious dance of buckshot and demon blood. Ultimately, this game is all about having fun and it just absolutely nails it. The issue that some may find is that it takes nothing seriously, so if you try to find some deeper meaning from the story or any form of nuance beyond the arcadey action, you'll come away dissappointed. Yet, for anyone going into this expecting the refined run-and-gun action of a pureblood Doom game, that is precisely what you will find."

1337,navid314,"Jan 17, 2021",10,"Disclaimer: I have played this game on PC and I highly recommend to use a Keyboard/Mouse over a controller to get the most out of this game. A extremely polished, optimized game that gives you an adrenaline rush like no other. This game is an improvement over its predecessor in every way. They made the combat more strategic and you have to utilize all your guns to get through the enemies. As good a game as 2016 was, I can't see myself going back to it after playing this. This is classic old school gaming at its finest: action packed, intense and unforgiving. Remember when you could get your a** kicked in games for not preparing? When you could die in a 15 minute boss fight after dealing off 95% of its health? When you got the full game and no added microtransactions? Yeah, that's Doom Eternal. I am a fan of this ID team and I'm looking forward to see how they plan to top this masterpiece!"

1340,ASGunvolt,"Jun 26, 2020",9,"This is truly a Renaissance for classic arena shooters, beefed up and roided to modernize it, and the Id team does the original a service once again. I needn't even mention Mick Gordon's part in creating this game, because the soundtrack outmatches 2016's in almost every way. The gameplay relies a lot more on movement and is a lot less forgiving if you're a stationary target. The collectibles system is also improved upon since 2016, giving you cheats and a lot more things to have fun with. Bosses are a lot more fun that just ""strafe and shoot"".All in all, would recommend if you're a fan of older arena style shooters, this game's developers truly respect the originals."
1341,Fordalulz,"Jul 10, 2020",10,"Awesome game. They kept most of the mechanics of Doom 2016, but refined them, and now it depends even more of our strategy as gamers. You have to be careful about your ammo and use all of our resources as smart as possible. Also the dificulty of the game has been enhanced and the platforms parts has been placed in the right zones. Simply perfect."
1342,Nitrocz,"Jul 29, 2020",8,"DOOM Eternal is really good game, but he has a few mistakes. Gameplay is very smooth and very good. The story is nothing much. So that you understand story, So you have to read it. Which comes to me nothing much. Battlemode isn’t big surprise snd he didn't inspire me. There is many kinds of demons. Some bossfights are not good and sometimes they are. And the end was a little weaker than the end of DOOM 2016. For me is DOOM Eternal best shooter game of 2020."
1343,Sanastusa,"Aug  1, 2020",9,"Doom Eternal - 2020 - Play Time: 17 hours A blood soaked action packed adrenaline rushed sequel to Doom (2016) and it delivers and all aspects. Combat feels more intense and punishing if you stop moving. A constant game of chaining together kills, switching weapons to hit specific weak points on demons, and using your chunk machine chainsaw to replenish ammo. The ability for this game to give you a power rush but at the same time make you feel helpless is a outstanding piece of work. Hats off to the team behind this game and all the effort they poured into it.My single compliant with the game lies with the story. Yes, why nick pick when the game is such a hit? Because if you have a story, it has to be fluid. Regardless of how polished and excellent everything else is. The game fails to explain how we got from Doom 2016 to Doom Eternal. At first I thought maybe I perhaps missed it in one of the lore books (After collecting them all and reading them), So I went to the internet. Nothing. No explanation as to the time skip, how we managed to snag a badass ship fortress? Some say it will be addressed in  a future DLC but I think that is vile practice for game development. Positives:+Boss Fights+Tough yet fun combat+Mods for Weapons Negatives:-Lack of story between games"
1344,etbasch,"Aug  6, 2020",10,"The game is very interesting in gameplay, it now has lore, beautiful cutscenes, amazing music by Mick Gordon, and what I liked about it the most is that it has unexpected twists in difficulty, that sometimes blow your mind, especially when you have no idea how to beat the next stage of the game, but after some time you figure it out. Urt is very interesting to complete challenges and find secrets, dome of which are very well hidden."

1346,Xenomorph_kills,"Aug 15, 2020",8,Gameplay is the reason to play this game. It feels smooth and fun as though it were an arcade game. The story is almost non existent besides killing demons. A must play if you are a fan of 1st person shooters
1347,Kaioh,"Oct  9, 2020",9,"Well, what can I say? If you thought single player FPS genre was dead Doom Eternal proves it's not, in fact it is one of the best FPS games ever made. Level design, soundtrack, gunplay, replayability - everything is just outstanding. 2016 was nowhere near as good as Eternal. New Doom even has a hub! For a full experience play it on Nightmare (especially if you're on PC) - sure it'll be tough until you learn controls, but in the end you won't regret investing some time!"

1353,dVice_User,"Apr  8, 2020",10,"I was really considering giving this game a 9 because of my personal preferences, however, I decided not to. This game is, I kid you not, probably the best game I've ever played, apart from Halo 3 or Dark Souls. First of all, the game play. The game play is ABSOLUTELY the best part of this game. In the 2016 DooM, the plasma rifle and the rocket launcher felt sort of... Just unlikable to me. Not in DooM Eternal, though! In DooM Eternal every single gun, every single weapon feels amazing to use. The Combat Shotgun at the start of the game is a lot weaker than the one in 2016, where you could shoot an imp in the foot and he would stagger, in this game you're required to get actual good shots on the demons, usually it's just a chest shot and a foot shot for a stagger, but that's 2 shots, out of like 15 shots at the start of the game. I'll skip most of the other weapons and just say that they are WAY weaker than their versions in DooM 2016, however I believe that's a good thing, as it makes you rely on your chainsaw a lot more, which is back again with some of the most satisfying and best kill animations in the game. There are of course, other weapons. The first other weapon you'll get is the grenade, which, unlike in DooM 2016, is far more required. The other weapon is the freeze grenade, this just freezes demon and I honestly just like it a lot. One of the last weapons you get is the Crucible, I love this thing. I love how rare the... Ammo? For it is, and how powerful, quick and strong it is. You've probably noticed a theme in this review of gameplay, which is that the ammo is a lot more scarce and guns are worse in terms of damage, which I think is a good thing. This isn't like DooM 2016, where the game gives you a power fantasy, in DooM Eternal, you earn the power fantasy. DooM Eternal is a lot more difficult, requiring better aim, precision and reflexes and it requires you to switch weapons in order to survive, and I've noticed that A LOT of people hate that, and I can see their point, but I personally love it. This isn't an easy game, it's very difficult, if you don't like that, then don't get it. Next, the enemies in the game. They're just amazing, but I mainly want to talk about the Marauder, because he has caused a lot of controversy, but I will TRY to explain why I think he's one of, if not the best demon in DooM Eternal. First, lets talk about his move set, it seems easy to learn, but it's super hard to master. He has a close range shotgun, a middle range attack that flashes green for a bit, and a long range axe swing. One thing that a lot of people don't notice, is that he doesn't just use his flashing attack at mid range, he uses it after he becomes an Olympic runner and runs up to you. He can do that at any range, mid range is simply the most likely. He is the enemy that effectively turns the game into a horror game when you turn around and see him. Also, something a lot of people don't seem to do, is attack after you do a partial stagger after his flashing attack, see, if you successfully hit him with something like a shotgun, he goes back for a second, this lets you use a variety of attacks, a sticky bomb, grenade launcher, but I like to use the Ballista. So, to deal double damage to him, hit him with a super shotgun, then quickly follow with a Ballista. Next, the story.Just don't. I'll admit this game tries way harder than DooM 2016 with the story, but it sort of fails. But while it did fail, why are you playing DooM for the story? This is a man who says ""Rip and tear your guts! You are huge! That means you have huge guts! RIP AND TEAR!"" If you don't like the story, hold down R. Next, the graphics.This game has stunning graphics, and it runs very well, too. Although it is kind of annoying that the texture filtering is apparently so detrimental to the game, I mean, I've never had it above like the second highest setting, and this is on a RTX 2060 on 2560x1440. To summarize, graphics are very good. Finally, I have to address many of the games complaints. 1st, the guns. This game does NOT force you to use any guns, you have a choice, use the effective weapon, or the one that's ineffective. This is something called difficulty and challenge. If you don't want that, and want to use the shotgun for every single enemy, even the Doom Hunters, good luck. This isn't an easy game, for gods sake, stop thinking it is, if you want it to be, turn the difficulty down! 2nd, the platforming. Oh boy... Why do people hate it?! It's great, there's honestly not much of it, especially not in the later levels, and even though there is quite a few of them at the start, it's fun!  3rd, the puzzles. I'll agree with this claim, I don't really like them. They're easy, however they are quick, easy and honestly more of a nuisance. To conclude, this game is not easy, especially on harder difficulties. This game is hard, the end. Also, I'm angry punches are useless. BTW the music is so amazing!"
1354,NecrovizorXi,"Apr 14, 2020",10,One of the most dinamic game which will be very high appreciated by hardcore shooter lover like me.
1355,dabrams88,"Apr 16, 2020",10,"OK, before all the naysayers come out of the woodwork.. I have one thing to say. Stop complaining about ""waa, waa, waa, mommy paid for the video game and the graphics arent good"" because these have to be some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a video game. Go back to the original doom and compare it to this and you will see that this game's graphics have time and hard work behind them and a HUGE team. The game is a 10 because its just great, end of story. I see people complaining about games because of x,y,and z. Well if yall didnt complain so much you would see that you're complaining is actually causing wars between gaming companies and whats regulating the pricing quotas of all games. This is a big box game, and that's what you are getting, the game is a stellar experience. I've heard some say that it's not scary, I want my money back.. It's not scary because you are a big boy now and grow the **** up it's not the same time as you played the original. It's an experience in of itself. So grow up, buckle your boot straps and settle in for an amazing adventure. XoXDeXoX"
1356,Decayingcorpse,"Apr 18, 2020",10,"I really enjoyed doom 2016  and I was extremely excited for doom eternal. It did not disappoint. It was fun from starting the first level to the final boss fight. If you just wanted to have mindless fun. This isn't for you. It requires to change your strategy if the way you are playing isn't work. It forces to become better.  The ammo management is a very good design choice in my opinion. It changes it up from doom 2016 where you almost never needed to think about ammo, That's the main thing going for this game. You need to fully think about your approach to it. You need to be open to facing difficulty. The marauder is good example. He was difficult my first time fighting him. But once I realized I can't just go in and expecting to pump several double barrel shotgun shoots in his face I got through it.  Instead of pumping a few shots in the mancubus with the double barrel like the doom 2016. It's smart to first freeze him, use the sticky bombs to disable his flame thrower and then pump several shots into him. It's way more fun to traverse around the arena. Such as the yellow pipes you can use it to move around and then use the meat hook to grapple your way to an imp and then proceed to use the chainsaw. I also generally believe it the level design is way better than doom 2016. Overall an extremely fun entry into the series. I would totally recommend."
1357,patheticpenguin,"Apr 19, 2020",9,"The game runs extremely smooth with none frame drops or lag. I found myself not really thinking when playing though many people complain you have to constantly think. After playing the campaign completely there was almost no bugs except the full-auto shotgun mod crashing the game. It gives a challenge when you have to get ammo, health and armor pretty frequently. Battlemode works well but it should get better matchmaking."
1358,Leplivo19,"Apr 20, 2020",10,"Best Doom game ever! absolute improvement over Doom 2016, graphics are beatiful, gameplay is so smooth it will make you go oooooo,you have to think how to approach every enemy so you don't get cornered, you have to know how to use every weapon, every ability and upgrades. The UI looks awesome too a mix of classic and modern. I got the game just when it came out and beat it on nightmare (if you want it to feel like a Doom game, play it on nightmare)."
1359,ShaMana,"May 19, 2020",9,"Doom is a great fun explosive experience. Some of the level design is a tad questionable but when it rocks, IT ROCKS HARD."
1360,gameking,"Dec  8, 2020",9,Best shooter ever. The parkour system and the collectibles are very good. The graphics and optimization are awesome. Just one thing is bad and thi one is the game is too long. I am very bored last 3 hours. But other things are very good.
1361,VGamingJunkie,"Apr 19, 2020",8,"Overall, Doom Eternal is very satisfying to play. There are a few blemishes, such as moving slabs when you're platforming and purple goo that is just there to cripple your movement but, on the whole, moving around in the heat of battle can be very rhythmic and heart pumping. One thing the game definitely improves over Doom 2016 is the aesthetic. Doom 2016 wasn't terrible, by any means, but a lot of the environments leaned on the generic side, especially the Hell levels. Doom Eternal, by contrast, cranks up the insanity factor which makes it seem closer to the Classic Dooms that were made to be abstract and goofy. The plot probably won't win any writing awards, but it serves the purpose well enough and it was interesting to hear what the Doom Slayer actually sounds like. VEGA is always a delight to listen to, and you can always skip most of the cutscenes if you really want to just get into the action. The little nods and winks to Classic Dooms, including being able to play Dooms 1 and 2 on the Slayer's retro PC, were also very nice touches. Overall, a surprisingly nice upgrade over Doom 2016, even if it doesn't always hit every mark perfectly."
1362,JuanLuisGG14,"Aug 19, 2020",8,"DOOM eternal is a brave sequel that improves the gameplay core a lot, although it is aesthetically worse and indulges in some okay mechanics like the platform puzzles . While it isn't bad, it feels like it slows the motion or cuts the flow. I expected the game to be longer too, the ending was quite disappointing. On top of all, i got performance issues and technical problems many times.BattleMode is good and has potential, even if there's no more than one mode to be played .Update: after the technical problemas are over, i feel less biased to give it a score, and i think a 7 was too harsh.This game's gameplay is way better than 2016's. Even if i'm partial to 2016's visuals aesthetically, Eternal is basically 2016 for thinking men. If you go and decide to explore deeply the mechanics and the nooks and crannies of the game, you will realize how much of a improvement it is. After you do that, the true Doom Eternal shows its face. Best part of the whole game: Slayer gates. Just an amazing action experience. I still expected a bit more, like more master levels, for example"

1372,Shibbal18,"Apr  8, 2020",8,"Gameplay and Music save this game. Definitely worth picking up though, dont get me wrong. The story was supposed to be the focal point but, while present, it still somehow manages to take a back seat. It's led a cast of forgettable characters that show up, expound, and disappear. Other than one moment in particular, you don't learn much about the canon. The platforming is fine enough to break up the combat, but gets too Mario 64 for its own good sometimes. The visual style of the game is way too arcade-y, and completely lost the grittiness of Doom 2016. The combat mechanics are good and make each encounter its own puzzle to figure out. But they gutted their multiplayer completely just to introduce a new mode, which currently is the only multiplayer mode available. No reason to cut out death match, this is Doom. Replayability is a bit low because of this. The content in the Fortress of Doom also is only accessible through there, giving you very little reason to 100% the game.  The whole Fortress of Doom is awful tbh. The Marauder also could have been implemented better. A very challenging boss encounter, but every encounter after that he slows combat to a crawl. Mick Gordon kills it though, this is 100% soundtrack of the year"
1373,haloha,"Apr 26, 2020",8,DOOM Eternal manages to pull off 2 things. 1. Being the kind of game that schools are describing to parents.2. Being the most video gamey game out there. Good game. Play on ultra violence or nightmare for the full experience. 8/10 because some areas are more annoying than fun AND because they force you to make a Bethesda account even when playing offline. Classic Bethesda.Still Good Game.

1377,Butane9000,"Mar 31, 2020",8,"First let me say that Doom Eternal is a great game. But it's also not perfect. Doom Eternal is less a first person shooter and more of a twitch combat platformer. The game feels fun to play but it's not a shooter and while it ""feels"" like a DOOM game it doesn't play like one. The guns all feel good and have cool modifications. However the game was over tweaked. The enemies you fight all have a ""weakness"" to a specific gun or gun modification. However some modifications were unintentionally hampered or made irrelevant by certain game play designs. The biggest one being ammo starvation. Doom Eternal's biggest problem is that it says it's a shooter but starves you of ammunition requiring you to do things other then shooting. They did this to create incentives to using the chainsaw. In Doom 2016 I saved the chainsaw gas for very large troublesome enemies so I conserved ammunition for the hordes of hell. In Doom Eternal the devs have create the perverse incentive to use the chainsaw because it's the only way to reliably get ammunition for your guns. Glory kills on weak enemies no longer reward ammunition but only health which on the higher difficulties is also a necessity. This makes the game much faster paced but also changes the game to be less of a first person shooter. So far quite a few of my friends have expressed regret at buying the game or have returned it. I enjoy it but I can definitely see where they're coming from. My biggest regret is how hyped I became for the regular shotgun rotating auto mod that makes it a chain gun with shotgun shells. This seems amazing however with ammo scarcity it renders the mod useless as you burn through your ammo in a few seconds. The same can be said for other mods like the plasma rifles beam mod. It requires you to hold it onto an enemy in order to blow them up. The problem is it slows you down and will likely get you killed. This is what we mean by over tweaking or as other reviewers have put it over engineering. And finally the plot. This game is a continuation of Doom 2016 but the inherent problem is it skips some much needed plot. How did we the Doom Slayer get to where we are in Doom Eternal from the end of Doom 2016? Otherwise the games god some heaven/hell plot with the concept of balance and corruption. The biggest thing the game has going for it is the big plot twist regarding the slayer (for spoilers sake I won't go into detail) however the cost for this plot is a level that's ""entirely on the rails"" that doesn't really engage you. Doom Eternal is definitely a good game, possibly even great. But it's not quite a ""Doom"" game."
1378,6_4_IVI_3_I2,"Apr 20, 2020",8,"The overall gameplay was fun. The flow of combat, level design and difficulty was perfect for a doom game. If you liked the previous game, you will enjoy this one just as well. The only complaint i can dig up if i really nitpick is... you can sometimes get buried under a horde of demons and get stuck unable to move. But as Dark Souls players would say ""git gud"" and it won't happen too often. The soundtrack once again, amazing. I've never been more awake playing a video game. Story wise... well that's where it kinda falls apart.Doomguy 2016 was a badass on a quest for revenge after his heart and soul were shattered.Doomguy 2020 is a mindless psychopath killing **** just because.something tells me the original writer didn't take part in making this game.Doom was never about story, but i always prefer games with stories because they allow me to see the world through the character's eyes. Feel what they feel. Use their motivation as my own.So if you're going to do a story, you better **** do it right.I started this game with the motivation of ""i was betrayed, time to kill **** and ended it with ""unga bunga, me smash, you go boom boom"". The only motivation i had for finishing this game was the compulsion to do a 100% run.A little disappointed that the fan theories and previously set Lore was all just... blood punched out of existence and all that remains is this new doomguy that i really can't relate with nor do i want to."
1379,Compile,"Mar 28, 2020",8,"confusing, i wouldn't able to figure out the story. previous was straighter"
1380,punch3871,"Mar 29, 2020",8,"I can only really complain about... 3 aspects of the game. Everything else, brilliant, even as I was being stupid about a ""puzzle"". 1st aspect of the game, I didn't really enjoy the 5 purple goo portions. Everywhere else you're free to run about as fast as you'd like. It just felt like an arbitrary addition to the game, but as it was only a handful of sections, it's okay. Just... It didn't feel right. 2nd aspect, the Kahn Maykr fight was... not as epic as it should've felt. The arena's getting flooded with fire and enemies are shooting at you, and that's fine, but the music falls short. It's intense, but it's action horror intense rather than the bloodpumping music that plays during combat encounters. I guess it applies to the final boss as well, but it fitted more there. 3rd aspect... Marauders... Hot damn, those **** are unnecessarily tough. Getting too close and you get a face full of shotgun. Getting too far away and you get a face full of axe. Shooting them leads to your shots ricocheting off their shield, and they have a spectral dog that has a wonky hit animation that somehow manages to bite me in the ass 9/10 times. They have what feels like 2 seconds of opportunity where you can get some damage in, but doing not enough damage means it's back to dodging and weaving. Getting a Glory Kill on these bastardised demons FEELS great, though, and those Glory Kills make you feel like you're in the mind of the Slayer himself. For some reason people are complaining about short ammo capacity. You get a Chainsaw before you burn through your starting 16 shotgun shells, and it's on recharge, meaning it's always there when you need it to fill your ammo reserves. If you somehow manage to run out of ammo before getting the Chainsaw and not being able to progress because of it... Please tell me how you managed that."
1381,Jawshoeaw1,"Mar 31, 2020",8,"This game is awesome. Lots of fun! I enjoyed everything about this game until...... Urdak happened. Urdak is the second to last level of the game. I seriously was in awe of how much fun this game was, I was enjoying it so much until this level happened. Urdak brought my fun to a screeching stop. It went from this fast paced fps with occasional platforming, to a gimmicky platforming game with some fighting and it also brought in new enemies that added to my frustrations. There was a specific jump section that killed me multiple times, not because I wasn't good enough but because it was horribly designed. Finally when I thought I was done with the level, it had the lamest boss fight to add to the crappy level. Seriously this level took all my joy for the game away, it made me just want to be done with game, and it ruined the final level for me The final level was actually really cool but I was so mad at that point. Urdak cost this game 2 points. This game was easily a 10/10 but that level ruined the final act of the game. Still having said all that hate, I still enjoyed 90% of this game. Definitely worth a playthrough."
1382,NerfShooter101,"Mar 29, 2020",8,"The game was fantastic, however I felt that compared to Doom (2016) there were less glory kills while the berserker power up is active. The campaign was incredible, the Fortress of Doom was a great place to view your collection. Ammo runs out too quickly until you get to the third stage of the sentinel crystal upgrades, recharging chainsaw ammo was a cool feature. The Battlemode was a bit underwhelming, however it was a huge step up from Doom (2016)'s multiplayer."

Competitive multiplayer i could understand.Two months after the game's release, a surprise mandatory update has been released that requires you to install Denuvo anti-cheat to play, even if you are only going to play single-player. This software runs at a hardware level and exposes your system to security risks.If you are running a Linux OS it will brick your game, if you running a Mac with a virtual windows OS it will brick your game. It has an adverse affect performance for many PCs.You will need to link you steam account to Bethesda launcher account which is a steaming pile of fetid garbage. As many others have said the game overall feels far less fluid and fun then the 2016 release, for a shooter you sure do a lot of melee.

1389,SuperkenGaming,"Apr  5, 2020",8,"Doom EternalGreat and greatly overratedDoom Eternal features 2 modes, an online competitive mode where a demon slayer is heavily unfairly matched with infinitely spawning player controlled demons that just isn’t really fun unless you’re on the demon side, so imam just throw that mode away and focus on the reason everyone is buying doom eternal.. its hefty 17 hour long demon filled campaign, and this campaign is really great… here you play as a demon slayer, taking on zombies and demons on earth as well as mars, going through a fairly linear campaign, but one filled with traversal and platforming, which is a very welcomed change.. however I feel this new addition takes a back seat to the straight up demon slaying, which on paper sounds fine, but ultimately it leads to an incohesive feeling world that feels like a bunch of random video game elements stapled together.. and this is Doom Eternals biggest issue…. Nothing feels purposeful, it feels mindless and repetitive from start to finish, none of the levels are memorable, the combat is constant, never giving you a chance to breathe or explore, it’s a headache… playing through doom eternal is an enjoyable headache.. but still a headache…combat that time around is much more enjoyable though. Enemies having their weaknesses, making almost every battle feel like a puzzle despite feeling mindless at the same time, rarely leading to frustrating encounters.. but don’t get me wrong.. those encounters do exist.. though rare.. theres one over powered enemy specifically that kills all and any fun youll be having with this game in an instant… more specifically in one area of the  game where youre trapped with him and a snake enemy, and no ammo or health really around… which brings me to another gripe I have with doom eternal, its health and ammo situation… ammo health and armor really feel nonexistent in doom eternals world, instead the game relies on you using your abilities to obtain armour and health, you can catch enemies on fire and freeze them, you have chainsaw enemies for ammo… but I just feel like id much rather have ammo drops after killing enemies than forced to find a small one I can chainsaw..wait for that chainsaw to refuel and do it again… the chainsaw system in general is a nonsensical mess… you can store up to 3 chainsaw attacks, however there is no enemy you can kill with 2 fuels… so whats the point… theres 1 and theres 3… and then you have enemies later on that cant be attacked with the chainsaw at all because theyre too big… these enemies should be reserved for 3.. and the middle large enemies killed with 2.. it just leads to fuel hording, and the payoff is never worth it.. but that can be said for this games weapons as well, youre given amazing weapons towards the end of the game, but rarely any fuel to use them, which begs me to ask.. why even give them to me in the first place.. especially the sword… this item didn’t come into play and was basically unusable until the final boss… but if this was that weapons only purpose, I suppose that’s okay… but I feel if that is the case you should’ve just waited longer to give it to me… All in all I do feel Doom Eternal is a great game, its fun zombie slaying to heavy metal, theres a crazy amount of weapons, and different ways to upgrade these weapons, customize them to your gameplay… but just don’t believe the hype… go into doom eternal expecting a great game and not an amazing game or a masterpiece and you surely wont be disappointed…But if you go in expecting game of the year, youre going to get smacked with level design and gameplay that feels plucked out of the old god of war games with guns stapled to itI give Doom Eternalan 8/10"

1392,LidlMan123,"Mar 28, 2020",8,"Great game, but honestly I liked 2016 more.While the combat is better, harder and more complex, the level design is worse.Honestly I didn't mind the jumping sections, but because of them the level design is far more linear and half of the secrets are so easy to find.In 2016 you had 13 levels and in 12 of them were challenges. In Eternal there are also 13 levels, but only 9 have challenges. The levels here are longer, which is both good and bad thing. On one hand you have more content, but on the other I felt it should have been 2 levels shorter, because it started to get really repetitive.The bosses are great, except Marauder. Screw him.I didn't play multiplayer cause i don't play multiplayer games, but its kinda shame that there isn't snapmap mode. 8,5/10"
1393,PanMrkvicka,"Mar 29, 2020",8,"The game is pretty good but also dissapointing but still not that bad. It has issues and everything has already been said like ammo capacity, weak points, some enemies and boss fights. Also the platforming isnt as bad as other people say its just unnecessary and boring but it take like 1 minute and its the easiest platforming ever so you dont even know its there."
1394,DreamCore,"May 23, 2020",7,"Compared to the previos Doom game I think this is a big step up. The levels all feel unique and are very well designed with exploration being really rewarding. There is a lot of mechanics to master here, and it takes time, but when you learn the flow of combat it is really rewarding. The performance is also flawlessly running at 60 fps in 4k with maxed out settings. The main thing that drags down the experience is that there are quite a few fights that are brutally unforgiving even on the easiest difficulty, clearly they had some inexperienced designers working on this project. I also would have wanted a bit more story through cutscenes and the like instead of through wall-of-text-logs that I can't be bothered to read."
1395,AngryBaneling,"Nov  7, 2020",7,"It's a fantastic game with a very addictive gameplay loop and a powerful soundtrack to go with it. I would say that it's a 200% improvement over DOOM 2016's gameplay loop. It has set the standard for future DOOM titles. If I had to give this game a definitive score right away, it would be a 10/10 based on the gameplay and Mick Gordon's excellent soundtrack. The main campaign's story is okay. There are some big reveals, unnecessary retcons from 2016, and unexplained time-skips. And frustratingly, there is no explanation whatsoever to bridge the gaps either. So we can only hope Id Software feels compelled to share with us how the Doom Slayer got to where he is at the start of this game. With that said, let me elaborate on the things I didn't like about this game. Let's start with the visual direction of DOOM Eternal, which I don't like. It's not on the same level as DOOM 2016, which had a refreshingly gritty and cinematic feel to it. Every level in 2016 had its own unique lighting in different areas of the level. It felt handcrafted and organic. In comparison, DOOM Eternal feels very inorganic and bland with the monotone global illumination setting for the entire map, across all levels. Some of the interior lighting looks good, but it doesn't measure up to DOOM 2016. And it doesn't matter if you play it on ULTRA NIGHTMARE graphical settings because the global illumination methods used in this game make everything look bright and saturated. Fortunately, it can be mitigated by downloading the 'Doom Eternal DeLighter' mod from Nexusmods. However, the lighting itself isn't as beautiful as DOOM 2016's, which means the result is still disappointing, if slightly less. The weird 8-bit platforming in this game is excessive and immersion breaking. The Cultist Base level has some of the most nonsensical 8-bit platforming I've seen to date. It feels like something 10-year-old children would enjoy. It's the same with gore kills as well. They feel more cartoonish than brutal. I heard Hugo Martin decided to go this route so that his children can play the game. Fair enough, I suppose. It's just not for me. ""Attack only when their eyes glow green"" enemies and bosses in this game are a cheap gimmick passed off as ""well-designed enemies requiring your immediate attention."" No, they're cheap gimmicks and nothing more. It's not about the difficulty, it's about the enemy design. If the Marauder is a ""well-designed"" enemy, why can't we use the Marauder's shield ability in the Multiplayer mode? Because it is stupidly imbalanced, and Id Software couldn't justify its use in multiplayer. My final rating for this game is 7.5/10. I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. DOOM 2016 was a more satisfying experience for me. DOOM Eternal's gameplay and Mick Gordon's new soundtrack are fantastic, but for every two steps forward they've also taken a step back."
1396,Wave0Cloud,"Apr  2, 2020",7,"Great game all around with various fun mechanics which you can choose to enhance during the game and with every time I fail I feel like I learned something. Completing these challenge gates also feel really amazing making the game really rewarding. With customization players can change pretty much every aspect of the doom slayer and his weapons like having more hit points, armor or ammo besides the Runes and the many other upgrades. The game has minor bugs and glitches which seem to vanish automatically and appear without reason in the classic Bethesda style. There where a few jumping areas which are fine but somewhat redundant. In general this is a amazing game which makes a lot of things from 16 better and adw new fun mechanics. Bethesda. Net is also a reason why this isn't a 10. Looking at other reviews I can seriously not relate how jumping, dashing and using your chainsaw wouldn't be fun, the player can do these things often as a way to balance things out and they reload quickly after time, making you never really run out of the starting weapons if you just use the damn awesome chainsaw. Eitherway the game just gets better from time to time and the only time I got lost is because I was not paying attention. EDIT: Due to Bethesda.net never working this review has been downgraded from a 9 to a 7. Great game like I said, but having to wait 3 times as long on loading screens because Bethesda can't have working servers or being unable to play the fun multiplayer is a shame.

1397,Jarvis,"May  2, 2020",6,"Good game, bad sequel. Doom Eternal is a very imaginative and unique take on the FPS genre which I can confidently say is unlike anything I've ever played before. The issue is, that includes it's predecessor. While Doom (2016) was this incredible romp to hell and back which managed to capture an atmosphere and tone which was perfectly immersive, grounded, and visceral, in both it's gameplay and visual aesthetic, Doom Eternal looks and feels much more like a cartoon. Not only is the art direction, writing, and general atmosphere much less realistic and consequential, but the gameplay is also so over the top and fundamentally different than the previous game that it both fails to capture that same satisfaction the former had conveyed, as well as also completely removing the player from any immersion they had in the game's universe. Doom Eternal's gameplay is much less inspired by the classic shooters of the 90's than 2016 was; with a heavy focus on scarcity of ammo and health pickups, it forces the player to constantly micromanage all of their weapons and abilities; exploiting enemies to get whatever specific resource they need, while constantly waiting for certain abilities to recharge. In the first half of the game where you're still collecting all of the weapons and abilities you constantly feel underpowered  and overwhelmed. The game doesn't really get to be all that much fun until a little over halfway through when you've finally both acquired most of the weapons and abilities and have learned how to use them; understanding how to juggle every type of grenade, learning which enemies can produce the most resources under which specific circumstances, and learning how rare each type of ammo is. Unfortunately, by the time you've internalized most of this, the game will be mostly over, and there won't be a whole lot of time left to actually enjoy this system. Then there is Id's confusing decision to implement Mario styled platforming into the game, complete with floating platforms which drop when you step on them, and spinning ropes of fire. The platforming is serviceable, when you get it down it does have a good flow to it, but it really doesn't feel necessary in this franchise, and it doesn't gel with the previous game's style. Then again almost nothing in Eternal does. Finally the art direction and story are just completely divorced from what we saw in 2016. The bright colors and frequent comic relief completely erode the visceral feel of the game; and everything looks like it's under a white florescent lighting, even if it doesn't make any sense in the context of the scene. Meanwhile a lot of returning enemies have been redesigned and honestly just look worse; with some of the more intimidating demons of the last game now looking cartoonish and ugly in all the wrong ways.  Then there's the story, which on one hand feels like it had more effort put into it than the last game, yet it somehow feels much more thin. Plot points and characters come out of nowhere, it makes no sense without reading the lore, and it honestly just is not good. It's supplemental, technically having effort put into it, but honestly not having any emotional thru line or compelling characters. All things considered Doom Eternal is a fun and imaginative game which I can tell the developers had fun working on and I cannot say I've seen anything like it; but in my opinion they changed so much that almost all of what I adored about the last game is gone. If this game existed in a vacuum it would be an 8 or 9, but this game is so disappointingly different from its predecessor that it just fails to be a sequel."
1398,Thesamepr1ncess,"Mar 20, 2020",0,"Не мужики. Вы конкретно оподливились вместе с бесездой. Вместо того чтобы бахнуть бабла в еще один срывающий башню проект, они вложились в рекламу. Я уже чувствую, что меня будто наебали в эльдорадо. Я не выношу когда мне говорят купленное мнение. Почему купленное? Потому что на любом твич и ютуб канале говорят по бумажке одно и то же. Если в видео говорится о 20 часовом геймплее, то эти 20 часов ты будешь стрелять и прыгать, прыгать, решать головоломки ( В ДУМЕ))))) ) и прыгать,  не знать куда прыгать. Часть 16 года была действительно мясной, было всегда понятно что нужно делать и куда идти, в этой даже добавили подсказку. Ну просто подсказку. . . В дум. .  . добавили подсказку . . да. ( это не самое важное замечание, но довольно примечательно и о чем то говорит ) Кроме того в перезапуске все локации смотрелись органично, локанично и обьяснялись законами физики и лором. В новой игре нет ни одной локации, в которой не будет летающего куска платформы. Эти платформы рушат любое погружение в историю и атмосферу, просто убивает впечатление от первой части ( хочется пройти ее еще раз чтобы освежить в памяти гениальный ремейк ) и разочаровывают ожидания от сиквела ( чему способствуют купленные обзоры (до релиза в том числе) ). В первой части была история, которую хотели закончить, а из завершения истории решили сделать мем, при чем такой однообразный, банальный и несмешной. Я никак не смогу сложить историю 16 года с историей этого говнеца, прямым продолжением которого его и позиционируют. А теперь для тех кто кайфует от ""настоящего мяса и драйва и вообще игра года ( века )"". Чуваки, есть концепт новой игры. Элементы этой игры взяты за основу из игры 90-х. И если ""игра 1"" позицианирует себя как серьезная, ""игра 2"" не должна сравниваться каждым вторым с марио ( при чем не только от огненных крутилок крутилок, а еще и по цветовой гамме ), она должна остаться такой же серьезной, она просто обязана быть с незначительными изменениями, как это было с Вольфенштейн: нью ордер и нью колосус. А если игра концептуально сильно отличается от предыдущей части, то это либо говно, либо игру просто следует назвать по другому ( НАПРИМЕР КВЕЙК ЕТЕРНАЛ ) Я ненавижу разочаровываться. Я разочаровался. Я не получил продолжение истории. Я получил открытую концовку, которую я вынужден додумать сам, потому что если я продолжу играть, я испорчу впечатление от истории еще больше. А еще я ненавижу додумывать концовки, потому что так как додумал я, это не так, как хотел бы рассказать об этой истории ее автор."
1399,5teve,"Mar 21, 2020",6,"Good, but actually worse than the previous version. Too many fiddly controls, and genuinely appalling platform run and jump bits come close to ruining the game entirely.  It's still great fun when it remembers what it's supposed to be."
1400,fatehasfans,"Mar 21, 2020",5,"So, after all the hype we get a below average generic bloatware shooter with a serious crisis of identity thrown in. How did they get it so wrong? Ofc they probably made a killing in terms of money (so maybe they didn't get it wrong) but the game is terrible, I'm sorry. It's hard to explain what exactly is wrong because there are just so many areas that feel off.  No disrespect to the creators and developers, I'm sure they put a lot of work into this game but I'm afraid it has the feel of a basement bin weekend Steam offer where I pay 5 dollars to install and then uninstall a dodgy FPS. Nutshell? - Gunplay: Generic and actually counterintuitive. Nothing feels consistent, ffs even thinking about it frustrates me. Pity I can't uninstall what's in my head! Gun progression should be punchy and satisfying from the get go. In Doom Eternal, start with shotgun and it's meh, switch to chain gun and it's meh and tbh I don't even know or care what the difference is in terms of damage because it all just feels meh. I don't have any affiliation to the weapons I'm picking up. It all feels the same - the weapons lacks any real identity, this stuff is supposed to be at the core of Doom. When playing it's just stop, start, stop, start, pop, melee, pop, pop, melee, pop, pop -- look around and everything is still alive/little happens, I want to turn it off already, feels like a chore! - Map design: it's like Resident Evil 1 meets Parkour only you can't parkour and 99% of the explorable areas are protected by invisible walls, yuck! - Actio …. ...nah sorry cba the game is just poor. Given the build-up, the hype, the people/company behind it, and the price and we get this bloated travesty? Utterly shocking. 5/10 -"
1401,Garbageman111,"Mar 22, 2020",7,"This has a lot of what made Doom 2016 great. More great combat, and amazing music from Mick Gordon, but they took away features and added a ton of new stuff which borders on bad to terrible. The new monster designs are great, and the weak point system works well, but the game doesn't trust you to figure this out and throws a tutorial at you every 5 minutes. I'm aware that this can be turned off, but it should be left off by default. There is also no noticeable increase to the amount of enemies on the screen, so consoles are still kneecapping this. The ammo thirst is really bad. You constantly run out, so the game forces you into using the chainsaw on weak enemies (which seem to only be spawned in for this purpose) to keep ammo up, essentially forcing you into a loop. People defending this say it is to stop you cheesing the super shotgun and use your whole arsenal, but I found you can still rely on the super shotty, and assault rife like in the last game. The Marauder is an example of how the ammo shortage seems poorly thought out. He is so tanky, that you won't have the ammo to finish him even on the default settings, so the game has to always spawn the cannon fodder zombies so that you can chainsaw them for ammo. I have no idea why they put such a large emphasis on the platforming. It holds your hand even more than the Uncharted series, only way more glitchy. It feels very jarring and in my opinion, it doesn't really work in the context of this game and just acts as padding. The added dash mobility is nice though. That works well. Extra lives also feels poorly thought out and incredibly frustrating, especially the way you just respawn into a pinky gankfest. It can make it easier to get through certain areas for the first time, but if you hit a wall and run out, then the only solution is to git gud, since you can't stockpile them and reload a checkpoint, so I don't understand why they were added. There is a lot more of what made Doom 2016 great, but even more stuff added that ranges from bad to awful while not addressing some of the key issues like monster numbers and arena battles. If you bothered reading this wall of text, I would say wait for sale if you liked Doom 2016, and pass if you hated it. This is just my own worthless opinion, but I don't endorse the direction the game went in. Oh, and the layer cake of DRM can get stuffed. Well done Bethesda."
1402,Achaern,"Mar 21, 2020",5,"Maybe the game is amazing and I didn't play it long enough to know, but as it stands, it became clear this wasn't a game I was going to enjoy much, if at all. I returned it after 45 minutes of empty frustration. -You have to play it online. In fact, when you launch it, you get a Bethesda.net login prompt but your only options are to accept and make an account and always play online, or to hit 'esc' and be offered the desktop. Now, I got around this by putting Steam in offline mode and this bypasses the login. But the game makes it extremely clear it's not the full experience unless you're online. I can make peace with being connected to servers, but the way they implemented this was poor. -The game isn't doom. It's called doom, lots of reviews saying it's doom, but it's Quake! It feels like Quake, you run like in Quake and the level design is much more like Quake with needing to find the right ledge to jump onto to climb up. You have a double jump now right at the start as opposed to unlocking it later, so the game puts you an area where you can get easily lost, running around looking for where to go right from the start. I spent 10 minutes trying to find how to get out of the hallway after the first room. That's mostly on me, but it was still frustrating. -You can fully, and easily, run out of Ammo. Even gas for the chainsaw, so you can be screwed and have no way to hurt anything, as the default punch does nothing but mildly stun the enemies. -The chainsaw and glory kills are teleports, you can literally skip 30' of space to do one, but there is no animation, you just *pop* to where the enemy is. I guess it's supposed to make the movement feel fluid, but it feels really jarring to me. -The users online mentioning that you have to use certain weapons weren't kidding. You start with the shotgun, there is no pistol. But, since there are RPG elements, the shotgun is weak and cannot even kill a former human with one shot (but you can kill Imps with one shot), since it's weak, you're always out of ammo. -The game puts you in greyspace tutorial arenas when it introduces a new concept. It does not let you play around in the real world to discover what it can do until after the rote tutorial. It can thankfully be disabled in the options though. -When you hit certain milestone checkpoints, like a certain ledge or location, the enemies often despawn behind you, meaning you never needed to kill them to progress, you just needed to 'get to that ledge' to save the checkpoint. Makes it feel more like you're checkpoint running than clearing the Earth of demons, since you don't always need to kill them to progress. I know you always had the option of getting keycards to finish levels, but this feels off somehow. -Based on the last point, sometimes you'll find doors you need to kill enemies until the door opens, but then the door might instantly close behind you, forcing you forward, always forward. I enjoyed being able to explore back through cleared areas in Doom, but that's no longer. I prefer agency. -Since you're out of ammo, and since the enemies are constantly spawning fighting each other, you feel like a man in the middle unless you draw aggro. If you draw aggro, you run out of ammo, so suddenly we're playing Doom where I want to find that cliff, get to that door much more than I want to stay and slay, and that's weird. -The story, what the heck (not hell). It starts in medias res, which doesn't work well for video games like this. Apparently some ancient king made the doom slayer and sent him against the demons or something. I know they got rid of the idea that you're a human marine in Doom 2016, but... but... now it's fantasy more than horror sci-fi. I don't get it.  It feels like you didn't have the experiences from Doom 2016, like it never happened. Maybe it's filled in later but I dunno.-I felt sad watching the intro where it was explained that Earth has been overrun completely. That means you failed in Doom 2016 I feel. I know that's a strange hangup, but it just 'feels' off. Maybe that'll change as game progresses, but I had no reason to keep playing. So, there might be a great game in there somewhere and boy it's hard to ignore so many positive reviews, but it's clear this isn't a game nor experience I really need nor want right now. Game ran well on my GTX 1060 i5-4690 and 21:9 screen."
1403,kun001,"Mar 23, 2020",0,I was never so disapointed from a game. They should have named it better: Super Doom Bros.Micro Management Edition for instance...
1404,PEnchan707,"Mar 23, 2020",7,"TL;DR = Too many projectile enemies, too many unreliable/random elements, platforming that detracts from the main experience and a landscape I couldn't connect with or care about - compared to the excellence of 2016 that is. I didn't enjoy this as much as the first game.  It's slick and has the good gunplay that you'd expect from id Software but it's all a bit off compared to Doom 2016 on the hardest difficulty. They've doubled down on glory kills and added a slew off other gadgets that mean you have to constantly run, gathering ammo, armour and health.  Everything you need to survive has to be gathered, apart from the usual pickups that are strewn around the arenas. This mostly works and makes for a real frenzy but there are a number of issues that damage the experience. 1:  Stopping to kill minor minions feels petty and gets in the way of the flow.  You know they're fodder and they disrupt the cadence of you trying to kill the more staple enemies, the ones which 'count'. 2:  There are a lot more minor enemies in the big encounters, presumably because you need them to gather items as mentioned above.  However, so many of them are ranged that they can easily fill the map with projectiles in a way that makes some of the damage you take feel random, even though you're constantly moving and dashing. 3:  Compounding this is that you can take damage immediately after the glory-kill animation finishes, even if you're spamming dash during the pause in gameplay.  You can often lose most or even all the health you gain and it's out of your control.  Feels off and not as satisfying as 2016, where you often knew what you had done wrong. 4:  Platforming bits are mainly mediocre and can sometimes lead to annoying loss of armour or health before a big battle. 5:  The landscapes have mostly abandoned any real feel of realism so it all feels a bit fantastical and unrelatable.  I preferred it when The Doom-Slayer was moving through more believable environments, even if they were sci-fi.  This feels like a group of unrelated areas made to be a playground for the arena battles, like Unreal tournament. Apart from these criticisms and dislikes everything is good and I do like the active resource gathering they have introduced.  A 7.5-7.8 is closer to what I would give. I think my ideal Doom would be a cross between Doom 3 (atmosphere, environment and story), Doom 2016 (combat and glory kills), leaning more towards the latter, and then add the extra combat elements of amour, health and ammo gathering that Eternal brings."

1408,lilkillpappy,"Jul  3, 2020",7,"sadly, there are multiple issues that prevent this game from being as good as it should be and prevent it from being as enjoyable as Doom 2016.1. Combat sequences are over too quickly. You either die in an instant or you kill all the enemies in an instant. They feel more like a flash in a pan than an epic knock out drag out fight.2. The platforming and environmental puzzles were not fun and added nothing to the experience.3. The Marauder is like a monkey wrench thrown in to the normal combat flow, but not in a good way. In a boring uninteresting way. Essentially putting the game on pause until you deal with it.  This thing was a very bad idea.4. Lack of boss fights, and easy uninteresting boss fights. Some of the boss fights in this game were the easiest part of the game. I was expecting some epic battles, but instead I get another flash in the pan.5. The story is too hyperbolic and way too mellow-dramatic. In 2016 they understood the point of the story and made it fun and simple. In Eternal they made the story too serious and it wasn't interesting enough to warrant that. Ultimately the story was missing anything that would grab or engage your mind in any way.6. Probably the most annoying thing about this game is how it forces you to play a very specific way. You have very little health or ammo so you're constantly having to push forward through enemies with specific tactics and weapons. They took away our choice of how we want to play this game. This is the main reason I won't be going back and playing it again. I would say those are the main issues with the game for me. I hope ID finds their roots again and does better next time."
1409,robrobot,"Apr 10, 2020",3,"Doom Eternal isn't that good.Doom 2016 was a game that intentionally and obviously threw out the story, threw out monotonous level design and replaced it all with fun, gratuitous and satisfying combat.Doom Eternal is a lot of jumping puzzles, **** level design, bad pacing, and obvious arenas where you constantly run out of ammo fighting cheap enemies en masse.""combat chess"" is what they call it. I call it lame. I just want to shoot **** until it dies. I don't want to figure out a strategy. There's literally enemies in this game that are immune to certain weapons. In. A. Doom. Game.What? Seriously I can't count how many times where I had to stand around and look at an empty, boring level to figure out where the next **** jumping puzzle is. Or figure out where a switch was to open a door. This destroys the pacing.Also there's whole levels dedicated to lore. You know what I'm playing Doom for? It sure as **** isn't LORE. What happened to **** keycards and doors and corridors? You, know, like a DOOM Game? Why is there vast open levels with invisible walls and **** Why do I need puzzles and jumping hazards? I should NEVER die in a fps to jumping. EVER. I'll say this: the art direction is fantastic. The combat can be really fun, at times. It's just too few and far between.Also the PC version is really buggy! I've fallen through the level. I've seen let's players fall through the level. Enemies sometimes just vanish. I've seen enemies get stuck in the architecture and die. You're constantly getting tripped up or stuck on the walls during combat. It's also crashed on me multiple times since it requires an always online connection?!? WTFI wish I didn't buy it for full price, honestly.

1410,EnigmaXtreme,"Mar 24, 2020",6,"Sometimes it’s better to have a game that only just meets expectations, gets average reception, doesn’t set the world on fire but mildly singes it, that way you are not expected to exceed even that with your next game. Take Doom, the 2016 version, being the first iteration in well over 12 years, and already one version, one horrible, uninspired, carbon copy of Resistance version meeting a bloody chainsaw in the backroom, the series already had high expectations with the original titles being the trailblazers they are and recent Mods like Brutal Doom But, let’s get back to the future expectations here, obviously, after DOOM 16 became such a big hit, winning awards from all publications, there were obvious expectations to top themselves with the sequel, more weapons, more glory kills, ballsier enemies, essentially making the whole game Bigger, and Better. Well…..they got the Bigger part down Booting up DOOM Eternal for the first time, my excitement and anticipation soon turned into confusion, into frustration and finally boredom. It seems that in an attempt to make a Bigger sequel in DOOM Eternal, the guys at ID threw everything at the wall and hope to god it stuck and well, I may want to recommend less fat in their diet because a lot sure did stick. It actually starts off on a positive note, throwing out the pitiful pistol and starting you off with a shotgun and chainsaw, the chainsaw even has a regenerating single gas tank so you aren't scouring the map for them again, but soon enough things start to fall apart. One of DOOM’s weaker areas has always been narration, it was never a priority during the more halcyon days of the internet, fearing a distraction from all the demon-slaying and bloodshed, the Doom story was tucked away in a tiny little corner where no one could find it, like, the original DOOM had a story, no really, I think it involved a pet bunny or some **** and does anyone even remember DOOM 3’s story? Did you collect all the PDA’s just to get every riveting moment of it, he said with sarcasm dripping from his fangs. The best example of DOOM’s approach to narration was the number of times Doom Slayer showed he really did not give a **** about it in DOOM 2016, pushing monitors away, stomping at energy cells and doing everything except giving Samuel Hayden the middle finger. DOOM Eternal, on the other hand, proceeds to cram more narrative than anyone ever wanted or needed, I mean, previous DOOMs did have a story for people who wanted it badly enough, if you looked hard enough. But this time, we are introduced to so many characters and diety’s that mean absolutely nothing, at one point DOOMSlayer even bows to one, so we go from an unstoppable killing machine to this? What’s worse is that some enemies require strategies to take them out, waiting for the right time, their eyes flashing green or some **** like that and it honestly frustrates me, with DOOM 2016, he was an unstoppable force, punching through anything everything he deemed fit, now he can barely get past a shield while Orange Ghost Dogs bite his face and the BFG barely tickles, oh and if he wasn't already there, I’d tell the Arch-Ville to go to hell, demon summoning, bullet soaking prick that he is. Which brings me to the Weapons, all the standards are there, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Shotgun 64, Pulse Rifle, Chain Gun, but they have seemingly added more additional weapons and attachments, adding a missile launcher in both hot and cold, and while you need Glory Kills to get health, chainsawing is really the only way to getting a vast quantity of ammo and then use the flamethrower to get more shield and then, of course, there’s Hell Punch and when you are not fumbling with your controller trying to figure out which weapon to use in the heat of the battle. You are plummeting to your death in one of the games many, MANY platforming sections, with a double jump and air dash in place, DoomSlayer spends countless parts of each level, clinging onto walls, dashing in mid-air, and missing floating platforms which just make the gameplay more like a Metroid Prime than a Doom. Look, I’m not happy saying all this, Doom Eternal had been on the top of my hype list for months, I had spent all that time absorbing the Animal Crossing meets Doom posts like a god damn memewhore, this WAS my game for 2020 and I am absolutely heartbroken that I didn’t enjoy it more, look I will give it credit, the game at least looks bloody amazing at least, but in an attempt to go harder than before, the guys over at iD went way too overboard, in the end, this has been the most disappointed in a game I have felt in years, with one simple reason. It should have been better"

It feels more like Call Of Duty than Doom.If Doom Eternal was released instead of Doom 2016 in 2016, there wouldn't be a Doom Eternal right now.

1414,l4nz10,"Mar 25, 2020",5,"If you loved DOOM 2016, stay away from this one. Doom Eternal is a nice game, but far from being a real successor of the great DOOM 2016. Devs have changed so much that it almost feels like it's a different game altogether. And even those changes are for the worse. I'll make a list to be more concise: - Gunplay style is now forced down your throat in a very specific way the devs wanted: kill demon A with weapon X, shoot at weakspot B with weapon Y etc. You simply can't diverge from that equation or you'll die. The end result is a very repetitive experience that will quickly bore you.- Too. Many. Abilities. To the point if feels more like an MMO rather than an FPS. You have to be constantly on the look of your cooldowns and sequence your abilities correctly or, again, you'll die. This does nothing but add to the repetitiveness of the gameplay.- Platforming and puzzles are bad, dull and BORING. But the worst thing is they force you to break your flow. Your adrenaline is punching and you want to keep shooting demons? Too bad. Now solve this idiotic puzzle just for the sake of it or you can't move forward.- Immersion is completely ruined by the over-the-top arcadey style: floating weapons holograms, big question marks, big punching boxes and more floating objects and keys. In DOOM 2016 everything felt organic and part of the world. This game keeps reminding you that you are, in fact, playing a videogame.- UI is terrible, and a huge step down from the previous game. Honestly I can't comprehend why the devs decided to change the sleek and clean UI of DOOM 2016 to instead use a style that resembles something from the 90's (in all the bad ways).- The plot is rushed, poorly connected to the first one or straight-up retconning it. The start of the story doesn't make any sense with the ending of the first installment, and many plot points are completely left unresolved. Also, Eternal's plot is badly written and showed to you in even worse way: you have to keep finding journals to keep track of the story or you'll risk of not understanding any of it all. This is just poor directing. But this game has also some very good stuff: Game is amazingly optimized and graphics are insane, once again showing that Id Tech is a terrific engine. And the music is so damn good. Mick Gordon outdid himself once again. I desperately wanted to keep playing the game only for the music. Unfortunately, the cons far exceeds the pros, ruining what was an incredible reboot of the DOOM franchise. 5 / 10 A decent game but far from being a great game and the true successor of the first installment."

Cramped level design that impedes movement, ridiculously low ammo cap (less than 1/2 the ammo of 2016's Doom), teeeeeerrrrrible platforming, cutscenes (yes, really), melee that's worse than useless and the worst UI I've seen this year."

It's like they hired Joel Schumacher to direct the creative development of the game. It's cluttered in every aspect - too many buttons, too many extras, too much BS - what on Earth was left on the cutting room floor?! They've crammed in so many new game mechanics that run counter to the spirit of the game I want to scream. I'm so so disappointed I want to cry."

1418,nachilao,"Apr  6, 2020",0,"I refuse to call this DOOM.  It's just Eternal.  It has only sold well due to DOOM 2016.  It is only reviewed well due to paid off Critics and Fanboys.  No DOOM game before has ""weak points"" which aren't really weak points you just shoot the weapons off enemies so they can't do as much damage.  You can shoot an explosive shot in a cacodemon's mouth only to drop in lava after you jump over to glory kill it.  You have a blade on your arm but you're to stupid to use it during a melee attack.  Remember how sometimes you got killed coming out of a glory kill in DOOM 2016?  Well now that will happen more often since you have to glory kill certain enemies.  Want to have a choice between weapon upgrades?  Play another game then because there is a significantly better option per gun.  Most of the runes are garbage.  Find a site that tells you which 3 are the best.  Want to run all over the place, jump and grapple ledges to avoid enemies?  Don't count on it, you'll only back peddle over and over in the same circular pattern because if you don't you'll fall into lava.  Get to close to any enemy and it has an insane melee attack which will one shot you.  Except you have to get close to avoid shots from other enemies and because the arena is tiny. Honestly, I compare Eternal to DOOM 2016 in this review a lot.  However, a remaster of DOOM 1 & 2 with Eternal's graphics would be a far better game than Eternal is. Also if this game is such a masterpiece offer refunds to anyone who hasn't beaten the game regardless of time played.  If it's so good 90%+ of your sales won't request a refund."
1419,Terrier,"Mar 24, 2020",5,"The game is great but it is not the best Doom.First, it's frantic, the graphics are awesome, the scenarios are awesome, the soundtrack is awesome. There is a lot of lore and stuff. However, it is also a 3d platform game (some people are calling DOOMARIO), an fps that it is also a platform game. What could possibly go wrong?  Simple: The control is horrible for some moves.   This game is aimed to be played with a joypad, but it is also a fps (so you want to play with a keyboard and mouse), so it is nonsense.   For example, to jump and press the shift key to speed, it is really awkward without a joypad. Moves that you could do with Doom:- Jump- Double Jump (yes, I am not kidding)- Wall grab- Sprint- Double Spring- And all the combinations. At least we are free of wall-jump but it was lava (like Mario 64) and if you fall into it, then it acts exactly like Mario. I really enjoyed Jedi Fallen Orden as a platform-action game but it is not an fps game, while Doom is a FPS game. Also, this game forces you to run out of ammo every time, your main gun has only around 18 bullets max! and you need 1-2 bullets per enemy.  You could get more ammo with the chaingun but sheesh, you must do it regularly. If you are a trigger-happy game then this game is not for you. I enjoy more watching on youtube than playing it."
1420,DiZero,"Mar 24, 2020",4,"They took an old and proven formula that made Doom (2016) so enjoyable, and ruined it by adding elements with the only intent of watering down the gameplay. Most of these elements aren't particularly annoying, but the excruciating sections of ""platforms"" to get from a (very good) battle to another are enough to take out most if not all my enjoyment.If you enjoy jumping around from a platform to another, timing your jumps etc, then feel free to add 3 or 4 points to my opinion."

1422,PolarisX,"Mar 23, 2020",1,"I don't know what this game is or trying to be. I spend all my time playing the get ammo, get health, get armor sequence that it doesn't even feel like there is much else to do. The platforming feels bad and out of place, add zero to the game. The combat is way too tight, you are constantly on top of something else. It doesn't feel like your skills really matter, as in if you are a good shot or not. It's about figuring out the gimmicks as fast as possible. Then you get your good boy points, and some fluffy cosmetic things. I can't even imagine trying the slayer gates, it seems like some kind of self punishment, I have zero desire to subject myself to that. Technically game runs great, no crashes, freezes, hitching, etc. Some issues with invisible walls and losing your cursor on intermission screens. All trivial things. The story feels like someone opened a book in the middle and, said start reading here. It feels like a hot mess. I don't mind the high fantasy-ish lore, but maybe Carmack was onto something when he said ""Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important."" Granted back then we didn't have ways to convey it like now, but come on, this is just too much. 2016 unloaded a well paced story line that was interesting and you could keep track of. Worst of all, and more to the point, it just feels like a chore. I just want to finish to say I didn't waste my money, but its getting old. I hate saying that, I've been a Doom fan since the shareware days. I am honestly disappointed in a way that is hard to convey properly in a review. Sorry ID, not a fan. I get what you are trying to do, but I'm just not digging it."
1423,oiledmidget,"Mar 26, 2020",3,"I replayed Doom 2016 right before purchasing this one. Doom Eternal is worse in every regard, I am just not having fun playing it. It feels like a chore"
1424,plasticc,"Mar 30, 2020",3,"Doom 2016 was incredible. It distilled a complex system down into something that felt simple and fun to play. The combat loop was exceptionally simple yet felt amazingly crisp as an arena shooter, easily one of the best ever made. The game also had a good story (not that anyone cares), amazing music, great visuals, and lots of fun little bonuses. The most important thing though: the pacing of the game is excellent. You constantly feel engaged, and your character growth feels good with upgrades giving a punch, the ""work for it"" mentality behind the ultimate unlocks is great, making you feel like you mastered something. The game starts you with plenty of ammo and doesn't overwhelm you with too much right away, slowly ramping things up as time goes on. When you first get introduced to each new demon type, it can be a bit overwhelming to deal with, especially in combination with others, and so you learn to deal with it, but then you grow in power and can just bulldoze over them. I bought Eternal. I played it for about 1-2 hours, having played through Doom 2016 several times, I had some expectations here. I think it's a very weak copy, like a mandatory ""money printing machine"" that has to be followed up with a weaker sequel, despite basically being the same game, but in Bethesda fashion, it has to be ""upgraded"" somehow. So to start, you're forced to make a Bethesda account. For a single player game. You're then treated to a game basically identical to 2016 graphically, but which runs much worse (an issue which ultimately forced me to stop playing). The most jarring thing you immediately notice is that you have almost half the ammo you start with in 2016, forcing a ton of chainsaw usage right away. Then shortly you're introduced to two heavy demons simultaneously without being given an upgrade of any kind: Cacodemons and Arachnotrons. Cacodemons are much less annoying in Eternal because they'll swallow a stickybomb and become staggered, otherwise they take a ton of ammo to kill. Arachnotrons are formidable, unless you land a stickybomb on their turret and disable their ranged attack. This is the technical gameplay change from 2016, and it interrupts the flow and pacing of the game significantly, on top of the constant positional, movement, and ammo interruptions. It already feels like a vastly inferior version of 2016. Then after a bunch of platforming and a few levels, you end up being introduced in a few mega fights that are larger than most in 2016 interspersed within huge lulls in anything interesting happening with yet more heavy enemies without significant upgrades. At this point it's evident you need to use the chainsaw to take out heavy enemies and rely on all of your equipment and mods to effectively deal with situations. The end result is you have 7 things you're constantly cycling through and dealing with, making combat extremely schizophrenic. It's overcomplicated for no reason, and this utterly destroys the beautiful simplicity that was managed in 2016. The story is worse, the pacing is awful, the progression is awful, the overcomplicated combat mechanics feel like some designer's dream of mixing ARPG elements into an arena shooter and it suffers for it, and there are completely out of place elements. Like you could've made a DOOM themed platformer, but instead it had to be slapped in there because ""we have to add stuff."" No, Bethesda, you don't. You really can just leave well enough alone. All you had to do was add more content, new music, some new enemy types, and freshen a few things up. The 3 is because the game retains a lot of nice things from 2016, but unfortunately it ruins the most important ones."

So it managed to be difficult but also empowered the player constantly because you could flatten any enemy on its own. This game is the literal opposite of that.

1428,GoodMorningAss,"Apr 18, 2020",4,"totally agree with this comment: I really liked Doom 2016 and hoped this would be a solid sequel.. But no. - I don't need MMORPG-like cartoonish design.- I don't need infinitely respawning monsters.- I don't want you to limit my ammo this much, only to force me to use specific gameplay features.- I don't want to see those rainbow fountains of ammo all the time.- I don't need whole game consisting only of arena-like levels.- I don't need you to tell me which weapon is right to use.- I don't need tons of abilities with cooldowns in a shooter.- I don't need big shiny question marks on secrets and arcade-styled powerups.- I don't need this much platforming.- I don't want this weird way of storytelling. I simply don't get why we couldn't keep the formula of Doom 2016, where it was so satisfying to crush monsters' sculls. Where is it all gone? And where is all this storyline coming from? Why do we need this generic fantasy nonsense in a Doom game, what is it, Harry Potter fanfiction? And also why do I need to watch monsters fighting each other without taking any actual damage? Is it supposed to be funny? Thanks, but no, refund, I will rather play any other Doom game. This one is not just a bad Doom game, this is not even a shooter. This is First Person Mario-Dota-Slasher, a new kind of genre, which I defenitely do NOT like. And it is a shame they spoiled great Doom series with this awful game. PS. What those positive reviewers are even talking about - ""resource management"", ""strategic thinking""? How about this strategy - ""press E for ammo, press C for health"", does it sound smart to you? Resource management existed in classic Doom games where you had actually to learn level to find hidden ammo, or otherwise you would just die, because there was no infinite farming. Modern mass-market ""gamers"" would just cry, I believe, so here you have doom eternal."
1429,SerJonSnow,"Mar 23, 2020",3,Doom Eternal is basically Doom (2016) again but with more tedious platforming and without the ability to play how you want. You're forced to constantly switch weapons and mash melee attacks to ensure you have enough ammo and health to scrape by.
1430,Interman,"Mar 24, 2020",0,"Fun, But An Overall Disappointment - save your money, and wait for a sale. First things first, I've been a massive Doom fanboy since the originals, and have loved playing Doom (yes, even Doom 3) throughout the decades. I was a HUGE fan of 2016 Doom, and thought they did nearly everything right - tone, presentation, game play loops, and mechanics. I'm nearly finished with Doom Eternal on Nightmare difficulty, and have grown very accustomed to how different this game is from the previous title, and hoo-boy, it is very different. Which leads me to my next point - Doom Eternal is a big let down for me. Here's my thoughts why: TL,DRThe game play, tone, art direction, and story changes are a step backwards from Doom 2016, and create an annoying, and just overall un-fun combat experience. The more I played, the less enjoyable each combat arena got, to the point where each one was approached with the mindset of just wanting to get it over with as fast as possible so I could get back to the actual fun parts of the game. I will finish the game, and I won't refund it since I did find some enjoyment out of it, but It's been a big enough let down that I found myself playing one level at a time of Eternal in between marathon sessions of Doom 2016. One of those games will continue to take up space on my hard drive. And it won't be Eternal. Pros:There's some good additions here, that really are a step above 2016 Doom:- Double dash, love it and feels great to use- Blood punch, feels fun to use- Destructible demons, adds some nice strategy to combat- Grenade launcher, flame cannon, ice bomb are fun t o use and serve a good purpose Cons:There's a good deal of them, and many stem from them pushing their ""new"" preferred play style waaaay too hard. Gameplay- Ammo is very scarce. I know you have a chainsaw, and that it auto refills, but you will find yourself running away from fights extremely frequently to find another fodder zombie to chainsaw for ammo.- Demons are massive bullet sponges unless you target their weak spots, and only if you do so with the ""proper"" gun. Using the scoped heavy rifle, or the sticky shotgun grenade, will insta-gib most enemies weak points and make them significantly easier to kill. Not a problem at first glance, but when you realize that trying to destroy an enemy's weak point with any other gun results in them tanking your entire ammo stack, you start to ask ""what gives here?"" It's incredibly inefficient to target weak points with anything but a select few guns, which leads to a very inconsistent feeling encounters with the same enemies.- Their desire to have you constantly swapping weapons, throwing grenades, chainsawing, and running around sounds good at first, but is taken to an un-enjoyable extreme here and very quickly feels more like a forced chore in micromanagement, rather than the game empowering you to WANT to use all those tools. Instead, it feels unnaturally forced.- Overall, the new combat loop and play style they're forcing has you running AWAY from combat to seek out some walking ammo zombie, health pod, or free space to switch to the specific weapon and mod the game wants you to use for an enemy than I ever did in Doom 2016, and that constant running and circling away from combat, instead of INTO combat, coupled with the lack of consistent ammo, and the fact that your health can get insta-dropped in one or two hits, made this game's Doom Guy feel like the exact opposite of a badass. If they wanted you to feel like a badass in Doom, this is not how to do it. Presentation and Story- Story is a mess, and takes place way to far removed from the first game. It almost feels like this is Doom 2016's ""Far Cry: Blood Dragon""- Art direction and overall tonality of the game are drastically different. If you like the tone and style of Doom (the originals or the 2016 version) this won't be for you. This is much, much more tongue-in-cheek, Serious Sam than Doom, and feels more like an Arcade bullet hell shooter than a true Doom game.- UI is garbage, and difficult to read / navigate"
1431,ZeroNova,"Mar 25, 2020",3,"Doom (2016) is quality over quantity, while Doom Eternal is the opposite. First off, I will say that I played through the whole game on the Nightmare setting, just so people won't dismiss my review for not having played enough of the game (I'm at 45h as of now). While the single player campaign is pretty fun, a lot of it seems very out-of-place for a Doom game. I'm mostly talking about the various things included in the platforming sections. Some of the milestones are also not working, and the multiplayer has a lot of issues, plus there's only one mode, which is asymetric and has one slayer against two demons. I'm also not a fan of this whole ""season"" thing where you need to earn enough XP during a specific time frame in order to unlock various aestethetical items such as weapon/slayer skins and multiplayer icons/titles. Anyway, I would probably rate Doom Eternal 5 if the multiplayer got fixed, and they remedied the various other issues such as the milestones, and possibly slightly higher if they got rid of the ""season"" part and added a DM/TDM online mode."

1433,avi-s,"Apr 13, 2020",4,"An Abomination..They screwed this one up badly.  Many design choices the devs made here did not sit right with me at all. The flow and mechanics from the previous Doom have been almost completely ruined and destroyed beyond repair.  Could barely even force myself to finish the game.The gameplay is tedious, slower movement, no crouch, monotonous and cramped arenas, constant -forced-teleporting towards enemies to execute kills and refill ammo every few seconds.  Badly designed platforming sections and vertical areas.The list goes on.. a story which they are trying to tell is told very poorly (as opposed to the much better minimalist approach from 2016),  level and map designs are also a serious downgrade from 2016,  graphics and artstyle , just the tone of the game in general are overly bright and cartoonish with hardly any convincing gore or horror elements to speak of. A Garish and obtrusive UI. The music score.. as one of the only remaining redeeming features, still somehow never seems to match the schizophrenic pace of the gameplay.. this time around. Eternal is overflowing with unnecessary gimmicks.  Quantity over quality. After playing through Eternal, went straight back into the 2016 game to refresh my memory..  The difference is like night and day.  Having played through 2016 multiple times, it is a far better game. Doom Eternal is an average shooter, at best. I am struggling, reaching, to award it a 5 outta 10..

1437,Fox_Vanilla,"Mar 25, 2020",4,"I wanted to love this game I really did. Doom 2016 was one of the best first person shooters I've ever played and sits alongside the original Doom and Quake, so I was expecting big things for Doom Eternal. However what was delivered is honestly a mixed bag. (I played Doom Eternal on Ultra Violence) The positives:-At times some of the most intense, fast paced FPS action delivered in years.-Amazing visuals, level design, great sound design.-Some great homages to the original Doom games.-Glory kills. The negatives:-The MARAUDERS. Easily the most frustrating and game breaking enemy I've ever had the displeasure of battling in a game. When you encounter one as a boss you think that's it but these guys later show up as regular enemies in the game. I have beaten Doom 2016 on Nightmare, Metro Exodus on Ranger Hardcore, Devil May Cry on Dante Must Die mode and none compare to the sheer frustration of encountering a Marauder on Doom Eternal. A Marauder makes almost every weapon in your arsenal almost useless and he can block a BFG blast. That's right. A NORMAL non-Boss enemy in a Doom game making the mother of all guns the BFG useless. Expect to die at least 10 times plus whenever one of these Marauders shows up. Expect to have your progress halted and the entire fast paced, fluid flow of Doom Slayer chaos reduced to a stall. The demons are supposed to fear the Doom Slayer yet I honestly end up fearing the Marauder for the frustration he is about to bring upon my game. That's NOT what Doom is supposed to be about. I replayed Doom 2016 several times, sadly I will not be replaying Doom Eternal, mainly because of these game breaking Marauders. Whoever thought the Marauder was a good idea was wrong. Easily the WORST enemy in a Doom game period. Fine for a boss, terrible for a regular enemy. -Platforming. Is this an Doom game or a Crash Bandicoot game? At times it feels more like the latter with multiple platforming sections which again slow the game to a stall, become frustrating and involve no demon killing. I want to shoot demons not swing on poles and climb walls. I wanted a First Person Shooter not a platformer. Some mild platforming is fine but Doom Eternal has too much. In conclusion: A mixed bag. At times Doom Eternal feels like the best of Doom and Quake 3 mashed together which is simply amazing yet it is too punctuated with enthusiasm killing enemies (MARAUDER) and platforming sections for Doom Eternal to rise to the top and reach first person shooter nirvana. Don't believe all the paid critic hype. Play for yourself and see."

How wrong I was.It feels like the devs didn't know how to make a sequel to the fantastic Doom 2016 game. If you're expecting a continuation of Doom 2016, you'll be in for a surprise.Doom Eternal throws you into the story as though you've been sleeping for 20 - 30 years since Doom 2016. You're on this island/spaceship thing which brings up a few questions: how'd it get there? How'd you take ownership of it? Etc.The repetitive nonsensical ""shoot a few times, then melee/chainsaw"" gets boring -fast-. Not to mention, you can't strictly go around melee killing the enemies (aka no shooting first). it simply doesn't work.The maps are all sorts of confusing and messes up the game's pacing quite a bit. Especially with pipe swinging and wall climbing feeling really out of place in a Doom game.The random almost unnecessary cutscenes for unlocked doors or random conversations with some random baddies are dull and over used (almost feels like filler to make the game longer).Weapon play feels alright, but mods feel like there should be some different system for managing them. The upgrade bots feel so out of place.Enemies look cartoon-like and they seem to have a crazy reach when being swung/bit at from a distance. With so many enemies in a specific area, the game drags on as you kill your way through with no satisfaction because you've only had to kill the last hundred demons using the slightly similar death action over and over again.The music doesn't do the game any favors either. It is horrendous and over exerts itself into the game. It's just being metal for the same sake of being in a Doom game.Overall, Doom Eternal disappoints in a hurtful way. Doom for me is about being a game where you get nostalgic about how far games have come. Instead, you feel betrayed that the hype is just that; hype. Regardless of what the media or paid sponsored YouTubers/Streamers think, I for one do not like the direction this game took and refunded my money."

1447,robomartion,"Mar 20, 2020",7,"For a game that is supposed to be fast and satisfying Doom: Eternal, like its 2016 predecessor is surprisingly boring and poorly-paced. What's happening on screen rarely lives up to the whirring guitar distortion and drums coming from the speakers. Out of the mindless but oddly satisfying killing there is no reason to keep going. Finisher moves are jarring as they cut in at times from meters away as if you teleported toward the enemy and with the blinking/rushing and grappling and auto ledge grabbing all-in-all there is just too much time spent where the game is controlling you for the sake of fluidity as opposed to the other way around. There is a point where you feel you may as well be in an on-rails shooter or a quick-time event cut-scene, where you just want the game to ease off a little and give you back control - or at lest some semblance of it. Moreover the environments seem still, sterile and stale as do the enemies, as if they are plastic figurines as opposed to being real bloody demons from hell. So if you like killing for killings sake, over and over and over, Doom Eternal might be your kind of game, but if you are looking for a meatier (pun intended) experience look elsewhere."

This is the worst in a line except graphics. I really would love to have this graphics in doom 1, 2 and 3... Especially 3. I bought this game and gave it a time, over 10 hours, then i just ragequit because of how stupid this game is made... Wont get back to it, i do not enjoy it, considering myself half-hardcore gaming. Seriously, if i want to play Mario, i buy Mario. If i want to play Doom, i expect this game to be Doom.

It feels like an arcade version of the awesome Doom 2016 game.I refunded the game cause after 75 min it became clear to me my enthousiasm, fun was in free fall. Avoid if you expect the same action packed blast of a game that was Doom 2016"

1460,D3D11,"Nov 15, 2020",6,"The problem with this game is that it is called DOOM for a reason which is beyond me, because it is nothing, but Quake 5 arena which pretend to have a story and gameplay. If you familiar with the original Doom series, you know that most of the fun came from exploring the levels, because level design was a separated profession back then, whereas nowadays they ask the cleaner lady to do the job. The mechanics is the following: you go in a perfectly linear level, and time to time you enter arena fights, exactly and precisely like in Quake 3 Arena. It is fun at first because of the game mechanics which is entirely optimized for this, but it gets old very fast. Even the design is entirely Quake. Some pickups, monsters and weapons are like in the original, but they couldn't capture the essence of the design, so it is like that and not like that in the same time. They have reduced every classic thing to a mediocre one. Just why? They had the original, how the ""hell"" they could mess it up? It is not as if they had to reinvent the wheel. Adding lots of Super Mario-like platform elements is also devastating. You are the Doom guy, Super Mario and Lara Croft at the same time. It is anything but funny. The other thing is that the gore is missing. They use weird colors and schemes which makes the gore not bloody at all. It is not scary, not disgusting, not realistic, nothing, like a cartoon or something. You explore the hell and the entire hell itself isn't scary at all. In the big soui-harvester you find about 8 souls which is tortured COVERED BY BLANKETS. I suspect this is because of the huge censor, so it is Disney-Quake, targeted the younger age group, which is completely unnecessary, since the true fans of Doom are 30-40 year old guys, and there is no reason to think that youngsters would not jump into it. According to the original Doom, it is mandatory to build the entire game on horror elements. And the typical ""realistic"" color scheme: everything is brown, gray, brown, gray, and brown. Congratulation. We have to mention the absolutely, devastatingly bad sound-schemes. This is apply on the 2016 Doom too. In the original Doom you cold recognize every monster, every pickup, every event, every weapon by their unique and absolutely amazing sound. Now you have a mediocre sound-soup, in which you can't recognize nothing. It is one of the biggest disappointment in the game. I simply can't imagine how they could NOT make real sounds. They would just have to copy the original, upgrade it and that's all. Same with the soundtrack. They asked the cleaner lady to make this too. The monster design is also mediocre. You going to find hard time to make differences between them, in most cases. Hilarious. The story is also boring and technically non-existent. It is just a cliche-war. I was so badly expected something like the original ""Hell On Earth"", where you can explore huge cities with tons of explorable areas and huge, open-ground fights. What a complete disappointment, compared to that. Even the original developers realized that they have to make bigger areas instead of tunnels. The only thing which is left is to give the game to the modders and let them to make something meaningful out of it. I gave it 0 points because this is not a 7.7 point game, but a 6 arcade whatever. UPDATE: after 20+ hours, if you learn all the trick finally, such as quick weapon change, quick aim, and get used to the game mechanics, the game going to be more enjoyable. However, there are times when you quiet boringly killing monsters at nightmare difficulty. While I stand for everything I say, if you master the game, it is going to be better eventually, so I gave it a 6 point instead of 0. It is true that the game itself rocks. It really has some unique characteristic, which makes it one of the best in the genre, but this is because the competition is so LOW. So regardless of everything said, I recommend this game."
1461,Ramiro1992,"May  9, 2020",4,"Another piece of crap by ID software. I have been playing this trash for a while and it started nice and funny until they decided to give me no more ammo. 16 **** bullets for the shotgun at max. are you **** kidding me ID? I can barely kill a few monsters with that poor ammount of bullets. This is by far, THE WORST PIECE OF CRAP DOOM I have ever played, and I have played every single one except Doom 4. ID **** up it's most important franchise. THis game is a blatant scam, they make a FPS filled with lots and lots of non stop action and too many enemies but they won't give the players ammo, I end up with the chainsaw with no ammo at all, despite having a perfect aim and ability, this game is pure crap. I was loving it until I ran out of bullets, amazing how ID **** up games so big. They ruined what could be one of the best doom games ever, the game forces players to play how the developers want, they force you to use those slow executions while getting shot instead of using your weapons, the game controls are a complete mess. The game wasn't even tested, or they tested it really bad. How the **** they forgot to give the player some damn BULLETS!! Without bullets I cannot do anything, I play it on survival caus I am too good, but without bullets I can just stand there and let the enemies kill me, what a piece of **** game this is. THe graphics are horrendous, not even close of what a 2020 game should look, I am running this trash with a 7 years old video card at full settings, it is that bad. After this tragedy the DOom Franchise is done, they ruined the whole game by not giving the players bullets.

1463,megabot,"Mar 27, 2020",4,"Not a worthy successor to Doom 2016. This game was marketed as a direct continuation to Doom 2016, but they've changed so much to the point that the only thing shared between them is the name. To summarize, what I expected was a slightly beautified battle arena in the Doom universe that was first and foremost a first-person shooter, but instead I got a 3D puzzle-platformer tactical arcade shooter with an annoying and complex game mechanics, atrocious storytelling and some really bad level design. I'm not even sure I'll touch any Doom game ever again, I think the franchise has been completely ruined for me. Oh yeah and Bethesda wants you to login to their servers for a single-player game. Below are five of my biggest problems with the game, there is more, but these five are at the top: 1. Disappointing game mechanics. Doom Eternal tries to force you to multitask in very specific ways, while not offering anything of substance to learn. This makes the game difficult because you now have six (6!) timers to pay attention to, while not being challenging to more experienced players like myself because the AI is easily exploited and the game still suffers from the same problems Doom 2016 had. Quake 3 was a good example of very challenging game with simple mechanics. 2. Terrible tone and atmosphere. They threw away everything they learned in Doom 2016 and went straight to confetti, rainbows, popups, tutorials, punchables, ripatoriums and other nostalgia crap that doesn't fit a sequel to Doom 2016. 3. Storytelling is cringey and expository.  We no longer have characters with agency, we don't learn anything about the Doom universe from interacting with it and its characters, everything is now expository, badly written lore floats like toilet paper in the crapper at random places and the game now showers the player with videos and cut-scenes. 4. Platforming & puzzles. I just don't want any platforming a la Prince of Persia or Spider-man in my Doom game nor do I want puzzles in my Doom. Jumping is fine, a bit of climbing like its was done in Doom 2016 is also fine, but swinging from monkey-bars and climbing walls is just unacceptable. I come for the battle arenas, if I want a spider-man game I'll go and play spider-man. 5. The Marauder breaks the game completely. The whole time the game teaches you that movement is everything, you must move if you want to survive, and yet when the Marauder comes in you are forced to stand still and wait for the green eyes. At the same time, the AI can be cheesed and you can kill it in literal seconds either by grenades and the crucible sword or by using SSG-balista-SSG combo. It's just not fun. Overall, if Bethesda had marketed Doom eternal as a game unrelated to Doom 2016, I'd have given it a good 7/10. That it deserves. But sequels are called sequels for a reason, and this is not a sequel. I cannot in my right mind give this game more than 4 points for it's a deeply flawed game and for Bethesda's marketing practices where they intentionally prevented independent reviewers from obtaining the game before release."

You feel that in these corridors no one ever lived, they did it specially so that the executioner would kill everyone there, and this skill is felt throughout the game of strange guards with coins, in that the technologies of the guards do something on earth, although where it would seem to be there, the artificiality of the levels also knocks out of the atmosphere instantly.The congestion of the interface, the Bethesda compass that they insert into each game, a strange pumping system terribly reminiscent of mobile projects. The game is not bad, but if you like to shoot or suffer at high difficulties, then you will like it three times."

The fact that it all looks so good and runs so well on moderate hardware is mind-boggling. The feel of the weapons, the way enemies disintegrate when you shoot them ... this game really had the potential to be a very good game. But most of the time when i play this game, i am just frustrated. Apparently they thought adding some super mario/tombraider elements to the game would be a great idea. More often that not, you will be retrying jumps for the 10th time, climbing walls etc ... It pains me to say ... but Doom 2016 was a much more engaging and fun game. Doom Eternal could have been a much better game than Doom 2016 if they just stuck to the formula. In the end ... its supposed to be Doom.

The level of detail, the effects, the lighting ...it is all designed with the philosophy of a racing game,as in ""They player is just going to rush by it, so no reason to put any work into what they will not look at."" Even if your PC is a potato, you will have no problem to set every setting to Ultra Nightmare, and still get a framerate above 100fps at 1440p resolution. I really hope that this is the end of the current Doom reboot series, and that they will go back to the ambition and immersion that was put into Doom 3."

1482,FucMc,"Apr  9, 2020",0,"The first shooting video game i played was Space Invaders in an arcade in 1980. I have been addicted ever since. I later enjoyed Gloom on the Amiga, Goldeneye on the N64 and Halo on the Xbox. Doom 2016 was my favourite FPS ever made, even more so then Halo in 2001. I had high hopes for Doom Eternal, but unfortunately i got conned. This so called game is not a FPS. It is a Slasher with guns, pointless Glory Kills and a Chainsaw, which is just for ammo and armour management. If you try to play Doom Eternal like Doom 2016 and classic First Person Shooter, you die, run out of ammo fast, and die again. You are forced to play this game like a slasher with guns. All enemies have specific weaknesses and you are forced to use a certain gun on certain part of the enemy! Take the Cacodemon. You have to launch or throw a grenade in his mouth! If you try and shoot him with a regular weapon, you run out of ammo and die. A typical encounter forces you to play like this-- Flamethrower, Shoot, enemy Flashes blue, Blood Punch, Glory Kill, Shoot, Chainsaw, collect ammo, Repeat. It is the most depressing game mechanic i have ever come across in a game, in my 40 years of playing games. In between these depressing encounters, in which enemies re-spawn, you are in a Mario 64 Platform gaming. So what exactly is this game? Firstly it is not a First Person Shooter, It is Mario 64 with Chainsaws and gratuitous Mortal Kombat Glory Kills. It would have been simpler if id Software had just made a 10 hour video of the game, because you are forced to play it in an exact way or you die. This game is a Slasher with guns, and some platforming in between. I have never hated a game more in my whole life as Doom Eternal. After 15 hours of torture, i permanently deleted it of my Steam Account and also permanently deleted Doom 2016 from my account, As ID Software and Bethesda killed the whole Doom franchise for me. They actually made me hate Doom, and if i ever see a chainsaw in any game ever again, i will refuse to play the game. "
1483,jin44jim,"Mar 22, 2020",0,"I hate this game. I feel like this game is fanboyed a lot because of Doom 2016 was such a great game. Doom 2016 was good in fact I'd say best game on the new systems but this game is trash (not because I'm not good or died just now (fanboy kids excuse to defend games that are trash) but because I have made it almost to the end of the game and I paid $90 for this trash and ofc can't return it so may as well beat it). We seem to be riding this trend of making these games hard as possible for esport players = good in the past 4 years. Why make it so hard? put more difficulties for those no life esport lovers but make it the same as doom 2016 difficulty for the normal difficulty. It was perfect the way it was (Why change what is not broken). Making games to hard for ppl makes ppl not buy the next one because it limits ppl that have jobs and don't have time to put into these games. I won't be buying the next game and I'm about done buying games all together if this trend don't end. Dif not buying new systems either. If you esport tryhards wants a game they need to make their own ******* games and systems. Games are not careers for the majority of gamers. If you want games that is for ppl with careers than make your own ******* systems to play on. Sorry for the rant I'm just so tired of games being made for these no lifes.  Casual gamers can't even get a single player game anymore because it's got to be so balanced and difficult for these COD, Fortnight, and League of legend multiplayer fanboys to have fun playing a dif game for once. One last thing I want to mention is jumping. Why is there so much jumping in this game like it's a platformer. This is Doom I want to shoot and run and that's it. If I wanted to play mario or halo I would buy those games. This is why games as a whole has lost so much from it's fanbase and most ppl has stopped playing games. Stop catering to these loser YouTubers and Esporters and make games for your fans. Your wasting money paying them to play it and say good things about it because ppl are figuring it out. That don't care what these youtubers or esports losers thinks about your games that are trash!"
1484,Nicain,"Apr  3, 2020",1,"Save yourself the money, avoid this game.  I got it due to cabin fever and regret it to the point ill never impulse buy again.You're forced into specific gameplay features, and they bloat the game with unnecessary elements to stall progression.  There is nothing more game breaking then having a face paced game hamper you and have you constantly resetting your checkpoint.Near the end they have these priest MOBs that spawn other mobs which is fine, only I gave one nine rockets to the face and it just kept spawning mobs pinning me down.  I could have beaten it given enough attempts but I just said screw it  and went on to another game because that style of game play isn't fun.Rather than using timing, sequencing and pacing to keep the game going and increase toughness their premise is to constantly respawn mobs, then spawn a mob in an arbitrary corner, that buffs and spawns mobs, so when you go to kill that mandatory cookie cutter creature you get pinned down.I would avoid this game and if I could get my money back I would do so 100%, which isn't something I say often when it comes to a game. Total garbage."
1485,Sirraj,"Apr 14, 2020",3,"I expected so much more. I thought Doom 2016 was one of the best games I've ever played. Eternal is very disappointing. Too many jumping puzzles, I find them tedious and frustrating. The graphics are great and much of the game is really a lot of fun, but getting stuck trying to make the same jump over and over ruined the game for me. I pretty much stopped playing after about 10 hours. Unless you like platforming puzzles I wouldn't buy this game. Very disappointing."

1488,Cootas,"Mar 28, 2020",7,"The perfect game lies somewhere between Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. Both are different games and offers different kind of fun. The old one is fast but sophisticated dance and the new one is a workout. I played Doom Eternal on nightmare on my first playthrough and after total of 30h play time here are my thoughts: Many things were done well but also many things were done wrong. Good ones: Meat hook is great the best new mechanic. Dash is also ok but it takes away careful movement planning you can always ""dash away"" from the threat. It makes the game a lot faster but also kills the dance. Also demons often block your way because there are so many of them. This game looks fenomenal the environment is stunning it makes previous game look like a pre-alpha version. Trully amazing job and the Id tech 7 is just superior to other engines. Doom Eternal is longer and more challenging. Music is ok it fits the game but is definitely not as memorable as Doom 2016 ost. This time music is really heavy often sounds like a noise or distortion. Shame you can barerly hear metal choir except one track. No more rune trials, you can even pick up the rune you want. Mastery token - no need for doing weapon mastery challange. Bad ones: The worst thing in this game is platforming literally during your 15h playthrough 3h of this will be platforming, boring corridors in previous game were ten times better than this. After first half of the game I was asking myself "" Am I playing new mario or a doom game?"". Levels with ""the floor is lava"" idea. Abysmal design. Micromanagement is too strong in Doom Eternal. You literally don't have time to enjoy slaying demons because there is always some job to be done like chainsawing every minute. Melee does no damage I can't even set up a zombie for a glory kill. My disappointment is immeasurable. Low ammo mechanic is ill-conceived, if 2 weapons share ammo what is the point of using weaker or less fun weapon? It does not encourage me to use all my weapons just like in previous game the best strategy is just SSG + balista/gauss + rocket launcher combo, when I am out of ammo for SSG or rockets I can just chainsaw a dude and keep going. Ironically they wanted to introduce more strategy but in the end this game is about raping your left shift key and spaming bullets at **** ton of demons that you are bumping into all the time it is not a dance anymore it is a hard workout not neceserally fun and at the same time the game forces you to play in a certain way which becomes tiring and feels like a job after couple of hours, not the best gameplay design. Many people (journalist or pre reviews) were saying that eternal is a much harder game and I know exactly why. They were simply used to Doom 2016 (at least most of my deaths were due to old habits) and didn't have time to learn all the overengineered mechnics. After your first paythrough on nightmare Doom eternal is not harder than previous game, really. Marauder protip: Every time he is sprinting at you his eyes will flash green then balista-SSG-balista combo dash and repeat. I figured out why you don't feel badass in Doom eternal: 1) Enemies are simply more bullet spongie, especially super heavies are nothing but bullet sponges. 2) Weak enemies like imps and zombies spawns indefinitely (and they have to because you must chainsaw something) untill you kill all the heavies. They are just artificial fulfillment, like food without taste and nutrition value only calories, you kill them and they come back so you are asking yourself ""why am I wasting my precious ammo?"" your kills are meaningless and you feel like a flaccid penis, an impotent. Every kill in Doom 2016 felt individual, like an actual kill, here you are just spaming fire at zombies exactly like in L4D.3) You are being strangled at every moment, you have to play as developers intended their ideas sound great on paper but in practice and in the long run are frustrating in a bad way.4) No cool animations saying **** you!"" (like throwing away monitor at the beginning of 2016 game) but that is what made Slayer so badass. Another gameplay design flaw: How is it possible that I can survive on nightmare running around like a maniac and not using essential mechanic like dash and using 3-4 weapons (just to prove my point I even posted on youtube video where I've beaten taras nabad on nightmare without dash) ? Who's fault is it? New Doom is dumb dumb instead of smart dumb and there is too much of everything let me cite another reviewer from this site ""the game is utterly overloaded with gimmicks. Poor Doom Slayer can hardly walk 100 steps without having to watch a cutscene, grab a weapon mod, collectible, new punching skill, new special ability, stat upgrade etc."" I am ok with cutscenes but I generally agree, this game really needs some simplification. I am confident that for the next Doom game the developers will find the perfect balance."
1489,Turulo,"Apr 23, 2020",5,Doom 2016 was way better than expected. This one thou didn't meet my expectations. It's just not fun. Somehow it looks worst than the 2016 version and silly like a comedy it's supposed to be hell like. The ammo mechanics which I thought would be interesting didn't work out. Out of ammo all the time with every weapon. And I play Doom 2016 in Nightmare level. So I don't know it's just not fun.
1490,Kroff,"Apr 21, 2020",0,"DOOM 2016 was such a **** blast to play. It is the only game you always keep installed because sometimes you just feel an urge to play it. Honestly this urge is still there with this game for me but it is always immediately killed once i play DOOM Eternal again. I think that they had to implement cheat codes kinda speaks for itself.I. The story is **** boring because it is like every other story in every other simple game. I already hated that immediately in the first cut-scene you saw doom slayers face. Why? And it looks so stereotypical and boring too. Also he talks like a retard in the flashback scenes. It sounds so dumb it made the words ""rip and tear"" sound retarded. I loved how in DOOM Doom slayer was portrayed like being a force of nature that just has to exist and only does so to slay demons, all of them. He had no face, no name, no palpable past or origin he just exists like the wind the sun or a natural disaster. He was to be seen as the accumulated hatred and rage off all existence. Now that really great portrait is destroyed with doom eternal. He is now some guy found by the night sentinels, trained by them and powerful because of a strange ritual performed on him. Just like every other guy with special powers. Just boring. Even in doom eternal there were these audio-logs of this researcher women talking. She said similar things the slayer being a force of nature and like religiously revered him in the last audio-log. That was awesome i do not know why they did not choose this approach of the story line. In general the story was just too much for one game in my opinion. Everything needed to be explained in these annoying codex entries. Ever heard of the axiom ""show dont tell""? it was so boring to read all that. The story you read was not that bad though but only reading these repetitive entries was just a chore. In general the story is just as generic and repetitive as can be.II. I hate the new Praetor suit design it looks like a bloated up carcass of the old awesome looking praetor suit, which i loved and immediately wore without exception after acquiring it in the fortress of doom. I do not want the dumb looking bare biceps. Also the fugly face shining through the visor of the helmet all the time looked hilarious and broke again the perception of the doom slayer as non human. III. Some of the weapon designs in Doom eternal look like crap especially in comparison to Doom 2016. That also goes for the Demon designs. The revenant for example had such a creepy awesome looking blank stare in 2016 now he looks like a power ranger with his shiny armor and fluorescent eyes. I do not like the new designs where they tried to remodel the old sprites. It doesnt fit and looks strange. Every time i see a tyrant it just looks so strangely out of place because of this dumb looking same old design they chose. The cyber demon from 2016 looked so menacing and so much more brutal in comparison. Sometimes you just got to let go of the old and kill it if need be. Also the soldiers with green **** hair and red eyes look like the joker but not like a demon in doom. Weapon design wise the grenade launcher design looks just awful. It looks like a plastic toy that you can win on a flea market. The skulls on it an the chains and all that paired with the silver looks like some cheap plastic toy. The skull on the ballista is also irritating. Doom slayer does not need skulls on his equipment like a skull tatooed retard he just kills with awesome looking industrial weaponry.IV. During fights the game just screams at you what you need to do and if you dont **** obey and play like they want you to you die. Amazing! That is such advancement in FPS games. So **** dumb. True intelligence for me is if i decide of my own wit what to do in a certain situation but the game just tells you everything you need to do to win. And that is not creative fun or challenging for your intelligence. Tactics for me are when i decide a way to tackle a situation and that requires intelligence. Not waiting for cooldowns or dashing all the time like crazy, refilling your meager ammo reserves and so on. You are just reacting to the game the game does not react to you, and what is that supposed to be? I think you could train a monkey to react correctly when playing this game. When you play Doom Eternal you dont feel like a Human you feel like a machine that has to react in smithereens of milliseconds to do **** otherwise you die. Creative director Hugo martin says exactly what is **** about the game thinking it is something great. He calls this ****ty way of obeying to the game the fun zone and they desperately try to hold you in that fun zone with their mechanics and if you do not obey they kill you...WTF! Fun is when i am free! When i can decide of my own accord how to go out and play a game! This is just a prison of a game..."
1491,FrostormNidhegg,"Mar 21, 2020",3,"Визуальный дизайн очень спорный. Дизайн локаций, особенно общий - хорош. Вот огромное озеро лавы, вот в нем гигантский демон, вот небо и вон шпиль вдали. Красиво. С другой стороны - радужное кислотное разнообразие, полностью убивающее атмосферу. Вот тебе неоново-салатовое обозначение пролома в стене, вот тебе розовые пятна, вот желтые. Когда убиваешь врага из него высыпается радужный дождь. Надеюсь фанаты сделают патч, который сделает цвета приглушенными - игра сразу прибавит в атмосфере, точнее у игры появится атмосфера. Сейчас ее нет, она убита. Стрельба - хороша, не уступает Дум 2016. Передвижение - добавили блинк, причем двойной, добавили платформинг. Я к данным вещам в целом хорошо отношусь, для меня они не являются минусом. Другой момент - как именно оформлен платформинг. Помните уровень из Дум 2016, когда надо было по обрушившейся железной дороге подвесной идти, и там были прыжки? - там все было оформлено логично, смотрелось гармонично. Уровень внутри гигантского аргент-реактора - то же самое, никаких вопросов, все гармонично. А в Дум этернал - вот тебе платформы, просто висящие в воздухе, а еще вот тебе огненная вращающаяся палка, полностью скопированная из Марио, из поздемных уровней. А еще вот тебе секретки спрятанные, они обозначены не как просто лежащие на полу игрушки думгая, как в Дум 2016, здесь они обозначены как гигантские вопросительные знаки, висящие в воздухе. Жри, не обляпайся. Атмосфера детского сада. Визуал - постоянная радуга все убивает. И если у тебя во время игр бывает головокружение - вот в эту игру тебе точно нельзя играть, здесь весь этот фейерверк красок просто убьет тебя. Музыка хороша, Мик Гордон никуда не делся. Сюжет здесь максимально убогий, при том тебя заставляют его слушать - вот тебе какой-то додик, и он начинает тебе что-то впаривать, вот три жреца каких-то, война, бла бла бла. Технически игра работает у меня нормально, не вылетает, не фризит. Итог - ну очень неоднозначный проект. Бесконечно лучше, чем Фолаут 76 или Вольфенштейн янгблад, но гораздо хуже, чем Дум 2016. UPD - удалил ее нафиг. Полный мусор. К пятому часу игры понимаешь, насколько на самом деле здесь убогая боевка. Однообразное нудное убожество. Слишком жирные враги, патронов вообще нет, вот эта идиотская система - переключись на одно, чтоб убить этого врага, потом на другое, чтоб убить второго. Говнище. Визуал - мусор. огромные цветовые элементы полностью все убивают. Вот тебе крутая локация, а теперь мы натыкаем на ней светящиеся убогие огромные светящиеся блямбы, и игра будет выглядеть как Paladins. Бесезда официально объявляется говноделами. Кстати, из ИД софтвар свалили все люди из старой команды, там только название осталось. Дум 2016 года - один из лучших шутеров всех времен. Дум этернал - мусор ублюдошный. Обходите стороной."
1492,Razrback16,"May 16, 2020",1,"Pros: * Excellent graphics* Combat smooth and enjoyable* A lot of upgrade options for your weapons* I like the way they rendered the Doom Slayer - huge, armored, just a big masculine dude - in today's political climate it's encouraging to see some normalcy from a developer. Cons: * Requires Bethesda account* No multi-GPU support* Platform jumping in the game as a mechanic is absolutely awful - it's good during battles, but not for traversal moving from building to building, etc. Not sure why I keep seeing developers implement this crap when it's overwhelmingly disliked by gamers.* Somewhat unforgiving combat which is a little irritating at times.* Bethesda recently added another layer of Denuvo that is breaking the game for lots of folks. As a result I have to update my review to NOT RECOMMENDED. Other: Overall it was a fun game that I will likely play again in the future. Final Rating: 1 / 10 - NOT RECOMMENDED due to the intrusive ROOTKIT DRM Bethesda just recently added to the game."

Would be a 10 out of 10 if there was a traditional multiplayer, or atleast more then a single multiplayer gamemode,not to mention to mention the extreme lack of options for the one gamemode there is, absolutely no progression system aside from cosmetic stuff. Single player was legendary, it's just multiplayer was a extreme disappointment :("
1494,swagballer,"Mar 21, 2020",0,"First of all I love this game personally. The folks over at id software have outdone themselves yet again and I can't wait for what they are going to add to this game and create in the future. I have only completed this game once so opinions can be subject to change I'm going to talk about the negatives first as these aren't very major (to me at least) but I feel like they are still worth bringing up. First things first is the doomguy/doomslayer himself. In terms of characterization I'm not a huge fan of what they've done. This is a huge spoiler but in the flashbacks doomguy speaks. I really don't see why they've made this decision. It is only in flashbacks but regardless this decision baffles me. He has basically never spoken which is one of the charms about him. He is supposed to be ""peak badass"" but the way he talks and the line delivery just feels off. I'm not against all of the new attempts however. For example, in the fortress of doom you can see what the doomguy does in his spare time like read comics or play metal guitars. I like this as it isn't shoved in your face, it's an easter egg for exploring. The second thing I don't really like is the change in design of the demons. I do like the newish designs but it doesn't make sense really. It seems to be going back to its roots and designing them like how they were in the original 2 games, but story wise it, there doesn't seem to be an explanation as far as I'm aware of. Some of the ""new"" designs I actually prefer like the mancubus, but it feels weird them just randomly changing what they looked like in Doom 2016. This is the biggest complaint of mine, which is that the start of the game kind of feels off. I can't really describe it well but until around the third or fourth mission I wasn't really enjoying myself. I think the main thing was the lack of ammo, which seems to be a very common complaint in other reviews. In the first mission I completely ran out of ammo and I was forced to die which just felt unfair. Now I will say that later on in the game once you've obtained all the weapons, ammo isn't much of a problem. You can still run out quickly but with the help of the chainsaw, you can replenish it. Another pretty big complaint, at least for me, are the marauder mini bosses. This was definitely the least enjoyable enemy to fight as it was just boring and felt very unfair. For starters it moves extremely quickly and attacks just as fast. But if you don't get the timings of your attack right, he blocks all damage from you with his shield, which instantly appears. He can also summon a dog which has a very lazy attack animation and if it hits you, slows you down. It felt like a chore to fight a marauder and the fact that most of the weapons are useless against him. The last complaint I have is that I was collecting all the keys to unlock the unmaykr and I missed one in a level I had already completed. But instead of being able to fast travel where I needed to go, I had to do the entire mission over again. This really killed my enthusiasm to continue playing. Now it might look like I dislike the game so for, but that is far from correct. Personally, I love the new combat. Doom has always been a movement shooter (well the good ones) and the new dash enhances the combat so much for me. Dashing through demons and grappling onto them felt genuinely great. The new glory kills are great and the enemy variety is incredible. Every enemy was unique in one way which really helps the game from feeling stale. The level design is great as well. The backgrounds and arenas are stunning and the levels are designed in unique ways from each other like Titanfall 2 (another great game). The story was kind of good in the last game. It was interesting but felt a bit lacking in certain areas. This games story fleshes out a lot more like the forces of hell, the night sentinels, doomguy himself (the fact he's the same doomguy from the original games is amazing) and the lore is very cool to read. BIG HOWEVER, I don't know if I'm remembering this correctly but I swear in Doom 2016 it said that Doomguy himself lost his son and made a deal with hell in order to resurrect him, and his son turned into the icon of sin. The latter half is still the same, but it isn't Doomguys son, it's a new character called The Betrayer. I felt that this was quite frankly an idiotic decision. It made sense why doomguy wanted to rip and tear through hell but now it doesn't (unless I'm missing something which could be very possible). Now overall my verdict on this is that it is a solid sequel to Doom 2016 in almost every way (why was the option to see how many demons you've killed removed???) and I would say it is worth the buy. I would write more but I am running out of space and apologies if this feels rambly or badly spaced, as it is my first review. Oh yeah and the soundtrack is still good in areas (a lot were forgettable at least for me) but there were still some bangers in the mix."
1495,kingofkoopas,"Mar 27, 2020",3,"I had mixed feelings playing throughout the game. I finally beat it last night and I could not wait to get this over with. The last two hours of this game were some of the most boring, repetitive and tedious things I have ever had to do. This game is like playing Overwatch but in single player. So after an hour or so my brain would start to get really tired. It's an awful feeling when a game does that, DIUM E is not the only one, but it really did it for me almost every time. Towards the last hours, even Overwatch seemed in slow motion compared to this, and that is not a good thing. Then there is the dreaded Marauder. This thing is a pain to deal with. It seems quite unfair to deal with something so frustrating. There is hard, and then there is tedious, this here is the latter. I started the game on Nightmare and was ready to quit within the first hour. I had just finished DOOM 2016 on nightmare so I figured I'd do the same on this one. I got as far the first boss on insane and could not do it. I turned on the sentinel armor and then switched to Ultra Violence right after that. The last boss is one of the worst things I have ever seen. Like most bosses in games, they usually have baddies to help them. I think we all hate when you fight a boss in any game and it isn't a 1v1 between you and the boss. As soon as you see enemies spawning in the room with you, you know it's going to get difficult. Well in this game you are fighting the boss and the insanely difficult latter mobs. You have to engage them all, because if you don't, you're going to die quickly. You need them for health, ammo and armor. You can't just ignore them as you would in many other games. My brain is tired from playing a game! I wish I had not submitted my poor noodle to this madness. I think that someone at 'id' got too trigger happy with making it insanely difficult. Then they realized what a horrible mess they had created. The biggest evidence for this is that the game allows you to cheat in any boss fight by using sentinel armor. Even games like Sekiro don't allow such nonsense. Clearly something went horrendously wrong with this game. Maybe it's the asinine difficulty, maybe it's that your brain gets worked to insane degrees, maybe it's that the game forces you to engage every single enemy, maybe it's that the game almost forces you to use every single bullet from every single gun. I really liked the multiplayer however, it's fresh and fun. Oh and one last thing, I wish they had not gone ""cinematic"" with the story line here. The demons no longer feel like demons at all, they're just stupid aliens now. I was hoping for something a little more sinister and not this overly bright and cutesy campaign."
1496,Stryker_777,"Apr 10, 2020",0,"Monkey bars? Janky nonsensical combat? What the F is going on with the chainsaw. The chainsaw in DOOM is a fun way to kill enemies. It's fluff. Its there to make you feel badass. What could be better than optionally choosing to kill an enemy with a chainsaw? It's an option. I like options in games. Is being pigeonholed and forced to play only ONE way a console thing? Console players like to have their hand held every step of the way. They like being told exactly what button to press and when.I like options! Like randomly executing a pinkie with a chainsaw if I'm in the mood.But here.. it's how you get ammo? They've turned the coolest weapon in the game into a repetitive, chore. W T F. Are the enemy demons like pinatas stuffed with ammo? So why is only the chainsaw able to get ammo? THIS MAKES NO FRIKIN' SENSE whatsoever. Why are all the happy reviewers overlooking this? The chainsaw mechanic makes no sense WHATSOEVER! It's so frikin unrealistic! Is this a magic chainsaw or what? Wow these decisions make me rage. Who's calling the shots up there??? Who came up with this ridiculous half baked idea that killing demons with a chainsaw magically makes them give you ammo?

It's Doom: any problem you can't solve with a gun, you solve with a bigger gun (or a chainsaw)! So far so good. Negatives: No quick save, in fact no manual save at all, just checkpoints. Much harder difficulty level than any Doom or Id Software game than I can ever recall before, going back to January 1993 when I first played Wolfenstein 3D. Even on the easiest difficulty (""I'm Too Young To Die"") it's a rather difficult game in places. How the hell anyone could be masochistic enough to play on the highest difficulty (""Ultra-Nightmare"") is beyond me. A significant amount of jumping puzzles (some of which are also time limited) make the game extremely frustrating to play as you have to do some sequences many times if you can't coordinate multiple jump and dash moves and there's no manual or quick save option to help you get through this. This is Super Mario Doom and I've stopped playing it as it's just not fun.

1508,Solar_Axis,"Apr  2, 2020",4,"If I'm being completely honest about Doom Eternal from my first impressions, in one word, it would be uncomfortable.  It reminds me of being drunk with friends one night and waking up on a strangers floor listening to them argue about breakfast without ever going for breakfast.  It feels like a shell of a revival.  The irony in the name, to take the momentum from the previous game and just drop it like this, it's so strange.  It's as if Bethesda hates gamers, took an IP everybody loved, and mad about the fallout76 failure held Doom in front of us and carved a big smile into it's lifeless face.  It's over the top violence like tom and jerry, not like a Doom, and its reflected in the design choices constantly.  The sound effects are taken straight out of the pages of Hannah Barbara (bottle popping sounds for headshots, exaggerated gulping sounds, farting platforms with a static texture pasted over it..)Remember when family guy got cancelled and then it came back years later but was weirdly computer animated and just mean for no apparent reason other than because they think that's what people like?  In a game about killing demons this seems to lack soul. It plays extremely well.  I was really impressed how smooth it ran though I noticed no difference between high and ""ultra nightmare"" graphics, but that's likely due to the ease of optimizing such an empty linear level.  The monsters move like robotic action figures.  I would love to be through an endearing nightmarish experience with story and platforming.  Titanfall 2 for example.  You can have story, jump puzzles, mechanics whatever else, and still make a really good game, so I look forward to having my impressions shoved back in my mouth, but I highly doubt I'll be able to get immersed enough to not feel patronized when I'm teleporting around with 'E' watching disney: after dark mini-cutscenes and being punished for exploring while launching over small stair-shaped ramps like a table-hockey puck and getting stopped every couple of minutes so I can read how to use the new mechanics when all I want to do is explore the map without get pushed off the edges of the world by invisible walls that are angled and smooth enough to slide you into a respawn facing where you should go. It's a patronizing experience.W to move forward guys..  If you're worried about accessibility put a tutorial mode in.  Reading isn't fun in all the situations Doom forces and if the levels aren't designed to teach players those mechanics intuitively then it's not the players fault for thinking the game isn't fun.  It's actually a kids game, and the dichotomy of doom being a kids game is extremely uncomfortable to me as I play it. That all said it's a good shooter and it maintains that Doom sensation of constant buildup as you're being collapsed on by enemies, it's just of way worse quality development than it's predecessor and feels perverted.  No idea why it's this way other than budget.  Obviously the music is of the same quality if not better, but the game is not."

1511,KsanterX,"Apr  2, 2020",2,"I fell in love with Doom 2016 from the first seconds of playing it. I was excited for this game but it made me hate it in just 5 minutes. Such a disappointment and a huge step back from the previous game. I can't believe that the same people were involved. So, here is a short list of my complaints:- The game loves to take control from the player to show pointless animations.- The tutorials interrupt the action and I was forced to disable them despite the fact that I can miss an important information about the game.- The controls are less responsive than in the previous game.- In general the game feels like a 3D arcade but very bad at that. I even fell down the hole because of collision detection fail.- The interface design looks childish and stupid.- When you kill a demon with glory kill it drops a freaking rainbow. Also, I hate the colourful icons around the map like it's a Nintendo game. WTF? I want blood and gore, not this.- The core gameplay loop: kill some demons, run from demons while trying to find any ammo, kill some more, repeat.- Because of previous point, you are forced to perform glory kills as much as possible and they become too old very quick.-  The level design is a mess. Why these arenas are so lazy? The previous installation's design was much better and arenas felt like a real place.- A lot of much more subtle things that made me uninstall the game after 40 minutes of playing it with refund request. I can't remember a game that made me hate it so much during the first 5 minutes. This is a bad Doom game and this is a bad game in general. It feels like a badly written mod made on top of Mario Odyssey. Such a huge disappointment. I don't understand what happened. Two points from me because it runs well. And that's the only good thing about it."
1512,leaveit,"May 20, 2020",2,"You're about to see lots of reviews that say that this game ""was good, until they added (yet another) Denuvo)."" Let me assure you that the game was not good to begin with. Every complaint that people have about the actual game itself is actually an expansion of what was wrong with the predecessor, DOOM (2016). Examples include:- story doesn't make sense- reliance on glory kills, not level knowledge, to stay equipped- level design is basically just linear with arenas beaded along on it- menus upon menus upon menus in a franchise that started with a game where you only had to access the menu 3 times in the entire playtime- cooldowns everywhere like a WoW-era MMO- rainbows all over the place- terrible modding experienceIn many ways, DOOM Eternal is the ultimate showcase of how PC FPS games have changed over the decades: in the 90s, you had a basic gameplay premise and often had source within 4 or 5 years, and these games are still modded to this day. In the 2000s, expanded budgets meant everyone trying to add in pet features that didn't work. Now, in the 2010s and now 2020s, you are forced by multiple kernel-level applications to play the game exactly as manufactured, modding is disallowed entirely, and the game will be dead in a couple of years. The true irony of the title is that the original DOOM will outlast this one that came out 27 years later."

It seems that the developers (or at least just one of the main managers) were not able to decide that they wanted doom or a mariolike arkham game:they took such logical obstacles into the game that has nothing to do with a doom game. The doom series is NOT about solving logical riddles that stopes you during the gameplay. (Call me stupid,but in many cases I had no patience to figure them out,but watched walkthroughes in youtube.) The gamers dont play for this stuff:instead of logical riddeles they want actions and simple rapidness,what we got in the 2016 doom game in a very high quality. Others: - it is neceserry to use chainsaw,but this obviously too much,sometimes i felt that i am in a lumber mill not in a doom game-you cant chose your weapon,this not else but a complete disaster in an FPS game.-for me its a bit a hard to decide whether the story schemtic or not. I did not like it but thats very subjective. However I must mention it had some logical disorder with the argent energy. Also the place where  soul extraction happens is not realistic. (For example its stupid that the whole worlds soul extraction happen in very small room.)"

1517,Shuffleblade,"Apr  8, 2020",6,"On any kind of higher difficulty Doom Eternal is ♥♥♥♥, don't buy it Doom is all about the gameplay and the action, Doom 2016 is a game i thoroughly enjoyed; this game however has made many gamedesign decisions that totally ruins the gameplay. In this game there are more than 10 different weapons however due to designdecisions they have very limited ammo. While taking away the feel of being able to freely shoot whatever is ahead of you they thought it was a good idea to add many strategic decisions in a game that is incredibly high paced. Which weapon should you choose for this situation? While running and gunning for your life you need to decide which weapon fits the situation best among more than ten different guns, which modification on the gun fits best AND you also have SIX different offensive abilities on separate cooldowns to keep track of and to keep using. You need to keep making these strategic decisions because the game forces you to do so, while limiting ammo so weapons arent as effective and designing enemies that you need to counter which particular weapons or abilities this game forces you to play the game the way it was meant to be played or die. When your weapon runs out of ammo you will automatically switch to your weakest weapons which idiotically enough uses the same ammo as more powerful and better weapons. If you like to pickup a gun and shoot things in the face until they die and just keep shooting until everything is dead this game is definitely not for you. This game is for those that want to be real tactical and strategic about the fights while playing at high speed. The enemies and bosses aren't meant for you to defeat in a way that is fun for you, they are designed to be defeated in a specific way, with specific weapons and abilities which frankly is not fun. It is hilarious to me that critics did not see the genius of Doom 2016 until they saw the communites reaction. Now Eternal is released and everyone gave it raving reviews because they think they were supposed to?"

1520,Re_d,"Mar 29, 2020",0,"- Unnecessary rock paper scissor mechanic in a shooter.- Always low on ammo in order to enforce the first point. - Infinite spawn of enemies in order to address the second point.Essentially a mess of a game trying to create a “thinking man’s action game” (said by the lead dev) out of what should be adrenaline focused, fast pace action. Ultimately what comes down to is that it doesn’t accomplish its own objective either because you will be just memorizing weaknesses and prioritize the high targets while keeping few fodders around for ammo instead of killing them indiscriminately like a Doom Slayer should be. They created a terrible mechanic for a game that didn’t need it. And to create the said delusion, they limit your ammo and your freedom to play. And to solve the low ammo issue, they introduced another dumb mechanic of infinitely respawning enemies. This approach is akin to say, The Elder Scrolls Six game hypothetically forcing players to do the main quest line first in order to promote “story driven game” by devs—destroying what made the previous series great. 0/10 to balance the fanboys."

1526,psycho_dog33,"May 14, 2020",0,"This is the ""Last Jedi"" of video games. Everything that was good about Doom 2016 is thrown out the window in Doom Eternal. The simple, but interesting story? Now overly complex and mind-numbingly stupid. The fun combat? Now repetitive, dull, and completely meaningless. The awesomely brutal Glory Kills? Now way too cartoony and not at all satisfying. The challenging, but fair difficulty? Now replaced by an enraging lack of ammo, and arenas that are way too small that have way too many enemies in them. Doom 2016 was, and still is, a masterpiece that deserves to be remembered as one of the best first-person shooter games of all time. Doom Eternal is an over-hyped mess that deserves to be remembered as a dumpster fire of a game that simultaneously tries way too hard, yet somehow not hard enough, to top its predecessor. TL;DR, **** this game 0/10."
1527,Grenna,"Apr 27, 2020",6,"From a technical standpoint, this game is very good.  It's polished and seems completely bug free.  From an emotional perspective though, something just feels a bit off.  As someone who grew up with the original DOOM in the 90s, I found myself missing the gloomy feeling of wandering through levels with the eerie MIDI music playing and hearing demons breathing and lurking in the shadows ahead.  DOOM Eternal feels a lot more chaotic and intense compared to the original.   I can see how some would like that, but for me it is just too much. The jumping puzzles in the game are well designed and satisfying to complete, but the problem I have is that there are just way too many of them.  It would be more tolerable if you encountered maybe one every hour or two, but it seems like I'm constantly running into them every 10 minutes of gameplay or less, which leads to a feeling of annoyance.  The violence is also really over the top.  My girlfriend watched me play it and was appalled by how disgusting the gore is.  To each their own, but I have to wonder about the type of people who enjoy things this violent. The platforming is a bit frustrating, and I don't know what to think about the extended fights where you kill mindless zombies to refill health and ammo.  It's an interesting design, but for me I ended up not looking forward to fighting hordes of demons, where in previous DOOMs, I couldn't wait for the next fight. Anyways, overall it's a good game.  I put in about 8 hours or so and got my money's worth, but I can't find myself wanting to finish the game."

1531,Grismar,"May 18, 2020",5,"As a fan of both the original Doom and its sequel as well as Doom 2016 (Doom 3? What Doom 3?) I had high expectations, but along the lines of expecting a somewhat derivative Doom 2016 II. I expected a very similar game, with a story line set on Earth and a decent replacement of the silly snap map mechanic. Perhaps a bit more focused on PvP and the maps to back it up. If only we'd gotten that, Doom Eternal would have received an easy 8 or 9 from me. But with Doom Eternal as it stands, I can't go over a 5. Technically, it's fine. With the exception of many parts of the scenery that I should *clearly* be able to jump on (but am pushed off of by some invisible boundary), the game is technically solid. There's even a few very enjoyable elements like the satisfying sound design, the passable score - I preferred 2016's tunes, but Eternal's is on par with my expectations there. I don't care for the more arcade disco and video-gamey visual style, but I accept that his may just be age and style. But what is up with the insane forced game play loop? Since when is Doom primarily a puzzle game where I get forced to replay levels again and again until I find the one way the developers thought I should play the level, to get just the right amount from chainsawing demons and keeping my health up with a glory kill here and there. This from a fan that finished Doom 2016 on every difficulty level with every possible collectible and even attempting Ultra Nightmare more often than I care to remember. Apart from forcing players to adjust to a single, railroaded way of playing, what's wrong with this is that the mechanic makes no sense in the continuity of the game world and possibly even worse: it makes the otherwise satisfying glory kills all but obsolete. In 2016, a glory kill was a power trip - a dominant move putting your character deeper into the action, with a glorious fountain of blood, to be followed up with a spray of bullets and more ripping and tearing. In Eternal, it's what you have to do if you can't be bothered to pop over to one of the power-ups that are littering the arena or when you really need some health because the game forced you into a small room with a bad monster - picking you up from a low point instead of providing a high point. That may seem like a really long gripe for something that perhaps seems minor, but it's emblematic of everything that's wrong with Eternal. Eternal simply isn't Doom. It feels derivative not just of its predecessor, but of the genre as a whole and I would have been happy with it as a $15 Doom-wannabe from another publisher. As the latest offering from Id, it makes me sad that Doom 2016 was apparently the final version of Doom. And the worst thing: I don't feel like playing it through. I restarted at an easier difficulty figuring I might just give it a more breezy playthrough, but the problem persist and I find myself thinking I'd rather give Doom 2016 Ultra Nightmare another go."

1534,adesr,"Apr 20, 2020",5,"Doom 2016 was an awesome game, while Doom Eternal is just hmm... meh. I'm a big Doom fan, starting from the classics. I was totally in love with Doom 2016. It was an almost perfect Doom in every sense. In anticipation of Doom Eternal, I replayed the whole campaign in Nightmare the week before the release. I was in front of the Bethestda Launcher waiting for the countdown to hit zero at midnight. Then I started the game and I really really tried to like it. I was fighting my inner self more than the monsters, trying to convince myself that the game had to be good, that the problem was with me. Unfortunately I couldn't win that battle and the verdict is that the game is just OK. So much wasted potential. Anyway, here are my lowlights: - The story is not connected to Doom 2016. They had so much good material to work on from the ending of Doom 2016. And there's not even a cinematic to start the game.- The graphics are disappointing for 2020. It's quite similar to 2016 and doesn't compare to other AAA games from 2020.- The Doomguy has no face in Doom 2016. He has a face in Doom 3 and in Doom Eternal. Guess which one of these games doesn't sux.- The style is very cartoonish, which doesn't work for Doom at all. WT* is going on with the bright and colorful loot items? I restarted the game multiple times and checked my graphic drivers thinking there was a problem with my rendering. And WT* is that question mark jumping up and down in secret rooms?- The game mechanics and mobility: this is where they ruined it all for me. ""All you need is ammo"", said Dr Samuel Hayden in Doom 2016. Now you need to be an acrobat to jump and grab monkey bars (WT*), climb walls, dash, double-dash, whatever.- The complexity: in Doom 2016 we had argent cells, weapon points, mods and runes. Eternal introduces life powerups and a complex weapon upgrade tree. You can put daemons on fire, or freeze them. Then there's the ""blood punch"", the ""empowered demon"", ""secret gates"", ""slayer gates""... Oh my. This game is a solid ""meh"". 5/10. Wasted potential."
1535,muldjord,"May  4, 2020",6,"If you haven't played Doom 2016, play that instead. If you have played Doom 2016, go and play it again. I am quite disappointed with this game. It feels like they took the good stuff from Doom 2016 and just decided to tack more stuff on top of it. They seem to think that would make it better. Well, this is a great case of less is more. Doom 2016 felt cool. It felt slick and polished. It made you feel like a no-nonsense bad-ass. Doom Eternal feels more like a single-player arena-shooter. Bright and colorful. Wacky and goofy. It's not all bad, but I just couldn't take it seriously when DoomGuy suddenly grabs hold of a wall and crawls on it like a spider. What!? And the platforming doesn't even try to disguise itself. It's literally platforms, in the air, you have to jump across. And swinging poles and... It's just so silly. Monsters are redesigned a bit. For some reason they have all new faces. And it makes them look more cartoonish. I love how the monsters fall apart slowly when shooting them. It's the one thing from Doom Eternal I am absolutely in love with. That's a valuable edition to D16's design. I don't care for the shooting mechanic design. There's too much stuff to keep track of. And you basically have to play the game a certain way to win because the uses of the different ""tools"" are so specific. Upgrades don't feel like they really matter beyond the weapon mods. It feels more like you are removing restrictions, than upgrading equipment. It just feels poorly designed. Like they forgot to design the upgrade properly and instead just decided to remove everything that makes him badass, only to let you slowly unlock it all again throughout the game. I couldn't believe how restrictive the game feels at the beginning. It's just no fun. And the exploring is no fun either this time around. Why? I have no idea! I loved exploring the levels in D16, it was part of what I did on each map. Now? I just want to get on with the game so I can finish it. I am about 12 hours into the game, and I've simply lost all interest in it. I'm not even sure I want to complete it."

1538,AnryReviewer,"May  8, 2020",4,"The original DOS Doom was great, the next Doom was great - a lot of suspension, excellent game, the Doom before Doom Eternal was ok - more fighting, but a good game, And then there came Doom Eternal. Doom Eternal plays like this:arena - jumping - arena - jumping - arena - jumping - arena - jumping - arena - jumping - etc. The arenas go like this: running in circles, shoot, NO AMMO, change weapon, running in circles, shoot, NO AMMO, change weapon, running in circles, shoot, NO AMMO, etc. - very annoying The Jumping goes like this: jump, dash, jump, jump, search for a key, double dash jump, miss the ledge, DIE, start over - dash, double jump, miss the item, DIE, start over - dash, double jump, etc. - until you make it to the other side - awful. GOOD:- great GFX- great sound and music BAD- the jumping is annoying - like you have to finish homework first to continue with the game - this is the Doom Slayer, not Lara Croft- slime pits where you can only walk very slowly and not jump- acid pits where you have to swim around and figuring out some puzzle while losing health- NO AMMO - constantly no ammo, and the big enemies need hundreds of shots.. also very annoying- after finishing an annoying endboss (e.g. the guy with the shield), he appears later in the game in the arenas - so you have to fight him again (and again) with dozens of other monsters attacking at the same time.. and you run in circles, with NO AMMO, constantly getting hit by some of the other monsters, which gain more and more speed later in the game- you have guns with two functions, you have grenades, flame, ice, jump, dash, punch, chainsaw... - way too much stuff for a game where dozens of monsters run towards you, and you have to act quickly to not get hit constantly.- you constanly have to change weapons in the arenas (because there is NO AMMO) - this takes time and is super annoying- many of the weapons take way too long to power up, or are too weak, too slow, etc. - but you can not discarde these weapons (which nobody needs) - and you have to constantly switch through all weapons during the fight- later fights go on and on and on and on... a big boss appears.. then another one, then another one... and then you get stuck at a corner, or didn't catch a ledge - and you DIE in two seconds - and have to play the arena all over again - man, what a waste of time...- later arenas are only button smashers and running and jumping, dashing, double jumping and shooting with NO AMMO - the monsters get faster, and you get hit all the time - no strategy at all - running in circles, jumping, shooting - while monsters and more monsters spawn all the time.- no satisfaction in completing a level or the game - after every mission I've hoped that this is the end of the game, because the fun factor playing this annoyance was very low. I don't know who likes to play this game - annoying jump sequences, arenas where you win by running in circles while randomly smashing buttons, where you constantly have NO AMMO, and get constantly hit. This game could have been great, but playing Doom Eternal is equivalent to work without pay - it makes no fun due to constant jumping and running in circles, it wastes your time, and is constantly annoying. What a waste... don't buy it - Doom Eternal is no fun at all. Cheers"
1539,loevenbalk,"Mar 23, 2020",6,"First, two quick things about me to show you my bias going into this. 1, I am fundamentally disinterested in FPS games, first-person viewpoints, challenges that test speed and dexterity, and break-neck pace in my games. However...2, Doom 2016 forced me to reevaluate all of those preferences with such persuasion that I've slowly started branching out from my comfort zone of strategy and management games. So it's safe to say that I was looking forward to Doom Eternal. Jaded as I've become from watching the video game industry load me up with hype time and time again, I've started to expect disappointment in places where I really shouldn't. But Eternal was not one of these places. When I replayed the predecessor last year I had such a good time with it that I didn't have the heart to uninstall it and free up space on my SSD until Eternal was released. Now I'm wondering whether I should uninstall Eternal and load up on some more of its predecessor because that particular fork of lightning did not strike the same place twice. Now, to be clear let me just acknowledge this. I think the devs made the game they set out to make. The game is polished and everything that you might want to work perfectly in a Doom game does so here. So in that sense I cannot fault the product. This is not an absolute failure, which is of course why I havn't scored it as such either. The arcady feel that they are going for is evident right from the get-go with the colour scheme. And it is perfectly understandable why. The 80s are delightfully retro at this point, and as we have seen from the mainstream media, if you do it right this formula is almost guaranteed to deliver success. But this game fails to deliver on several of the core premises that made its masterful predecessor appeal to even a sceptic like me, and the switch to a more arcade feel in this game is one of the first things that let me know changes were coming with this game. Changes I was scared of because 2016s release really didn't need many to be a 10/10. While the audio-visual feedback of slashing gore fed to me through a tube made of unholy metal tunes was the primary source of my enjoyment, several other pieces also played a pivotal role. Like the fact that almost nothing would break the pace. I felt like I was actively part of the speed metal giving me a rush as I was storming through the levels grinding my way through this demon or that. Even picking up little stashed away toy dolls wouldn't slow down my pace. My silent and faceless protagonist would simply pick it up, admire it for a bit, and whoever wanted that fan servicing would have had it without players like me feeling slightly short changed after discovering a secret location. In Eternal the pace simply isn't the same. While the combat may be slightly more chaotic (in a good way) and certainly more rapid, the additions to traversal mechanics alone make sure of that, anything that doesn't revolve around turning demons into goop with a bulletstorm actively feels like it is there to power you down. Picking up toy dolls stops your movement dead. Using almost any elevator locks you in place, and you can't even change weapons while riding it. The tutorials, that still show up half-way through the game, pause the action and hits you with an info dump in a text prompt. Everything about this makes me think the developers forgot their winning formula of minimalistic and unobtrusive story telling of 2016. I am met with an expositional dump in every mission, which really isn't all that interesting. The storyline of 2016 was mediocre, and relatively speaking it was the weak point of the game, but it didn't matter because the protagonist showed you with almost every one of his scripted actions that it wasn't what was important - shooting demons in their stupid faces was. In Eternal the story line makes up almost a fifth of the runtime of the game - which is substantially increased if you're a veteran speedrunning through the action and not mucking about like a casual like me. I haven't tested it, but it seems most cutscenes can be skipped but this doesn't excuse the fact that the story line is put into more of a central position in this game, and it is worse than the already mediocre story of the predecessor. 2016 showed us that the way to solve that issue isn't to introduce a skip button, but to layer the exposition into the background of the action. Now, is all this to say that I didn't enjoy Eternal at all? No it isn't. I am simply trying to qualify why Eternal failed to wow me in the way that 2016 did. It invited me to come play with toys I had overlooked. Eternal on the other hand is loaded with attempts at fan service, so perhaps this game simply wasn't aimed at drawing in newer players."
1540,FifthWheel,"Mar 31, 2020",6,"Doom Eternal is probably best summed up in one word, ""confusion."" It retains a lot of Doom mechanics and adds on with even more mechanics, upgrades, and puzzles. Early on, you can't hardly take two steps forward without seeing some tutorial for a new mechanic. There is a LOT more to try to remember when playing this game. The environments, while pretty, are extremely confusing to navigate despite them being linear. There are lots of environmental puzzles and not as much in the way of corridor shooting. On one occasion I encountered a bug where a puzzle was slightly bugged and I was stuck as I didn't realize I was experiencing a bug. There's too much story in this game. While Doom 2016 mocks its own story by letting you ignore it, showing the Doom guy rage on the environment while characters talk, Doom Eternal is a parody of itself in this aspect by including crazy priests, humans that are in awe, and demons that are literally so scared of you they hand you weapons. It slows the game down and just comes off as weird. While it's somewhat fun, it's definitely not as well polished as Doom 2016 and tries to add too much, ultimately making it a bit of a slog to get through and a confusing mess. It's also much, much harder than Doom 2016, which isn't a bad thing, but if you were expecting Doom 2016's difficulty again, you're in for a rude awakening. Overall, fans of Doom 2016 will probably enjoy this, but classic Doom fans might not."

1545,Herrnewbenmeist,"Mar 23, 2020",4,"I want to love it, but I've run into two game-breaking bugs that have ruined the fun for me. #1 Slayer gate keys do not appear. I tried replaying the level it happened on and it was the exact same thing, no slayer gate key. Then, I moved on to the next level, same exact thing. I searched online. Apparently if you use the mission select tool to go to an earlier level using the in-game cheats the slayer gate key doesn't appear. The game encourages you to replay earlier levels with cheats on to find collectibles. I did that, had a blast. Then I played advanced the campaign which doesn't even permit the use of cheats. Apparently that's not enough. You have to go into mission select and disable the cheats you can't even use and aren't an option on continuation of the campaign. Because that makes sense. #2 I got the rocket launcher in the game. Sweet! I had to take a break. I exited. I opened the game later. It had saved my progress to the checkpoint after the rocket launcher, but the rocket launcher was gone. The spot where you pick up the rocket launcher had nothing. I looked online. It's another known bug! The solution is to replay the entire level... FFS did they even playtest this? Combat is awesome and fluid. They made movement wild. A lot the weapons so far are just repeats of the last game, hoping for some new stuff. There's a ton of unlockable abilities from your runes, suit, base, equipment. I really like the idea behind all the advancement. Level design seems good so far. I like all the bones of the game, but holy hell the bugs. Wait to buy this game. It needs to be fixed"

1551,woody9x,"Mar 27, 2020",0,"Omg, I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I am in this game!  I have not been this excited for a game coming out in a long time and it turned out to be a kick in the balls as I very quickly realized that the developers completely ruined everything.  I understand the need to make some changes / upgrades to the game but why the F would you take such a loved game and screw it up so badly?  If this was the 5th Doom following the reboot then fine, but I never thought they would mess with the formula on the first sequel when all they had to do was follow the recipe that worked so well.  The 2 main things that ruin everything are the story, which is nice to have but I could have enjoyed the game without, and more importantly the stupid ass jumping puzzles!! Oh my god, what in the world were they thinking????  It feels like a mix of Mario Bros. and Tomb Raider with the double jumping and wall climbing.  I might even have been able to deal with having to do those things if I KNEW WHERE THE HELL I HAD TO GO?????  Jumping across lava on platforms that sink after standing on them for a couple of seconds is stupid enough but when you can't logically see where you go next and have no time to look around before plunging in to the lava OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER, it makes you want to absolutely break everything.  I will deal with difficult if I am shooting and blowing stuff up but not dying repeatedly in a jumping puzzle!  The new catch phrase should no longer be ""rip and tear"", it should be ""jump and dash"".  Damn you again Bethesda!  First you ruin Fallout and now Doom!?"
1552,skeletorone,"Sep  8, 2020",5,"DOOM Eternal is a major disappointment. It is overdesigned and frustratingly limiting. You are not the Doomslayer in this one. You are just a monkey that is supposed to jump through hoops and hurdles the game throws at you and you can't avoid it. In fact the game is entirely designed around that. The low amount of ammo you are allowed to carry feels wrong at every moment. It is not like there isn't enough ammo available, it is the fact that the game funnels you into a very specific combat loop to acquire the ammo. The platforming sections are absolutely annoying and sometimes just badly designed. I remember one section where I clearly was able to reach a certain platform with double jump and double dash but the game uses an invisible wall to deny this because it is expected that the player follows a different path. That's basically DOOM Eternal in a nutshell to me. You are not allowed to do it your way because we [id Software] have this very narrow, rigid synergy designed for you. The platforming aspect destroys the idea of taking a breath between the combat sections and it completely killed my desire to explore the levels the way I did in DOOM 2016. Yellow monkey bars, Super Mario style fireball traps, purple goo that sticks Doomguy to the ground... Really? The upgrade system is bloated. Technically the game is fine. It looks good and mechanically everything works as intended. Sadly, it just isn't a fun game overall and it is certainly not ""shooter perfection""."

1554,Nifi,"Apr  1, 2020",5,"After completing the campaign i can safely say combat is a HUGE step up from Doom 2016. Even though people complain a lot about the new mechanics being overwhelming, 2016's combat was too basic and slow (not saying it wasn't fun), so they fixed it. Unfortunately same can't be said for other stuff Story: 2016's story was side gameplay (if that makes sense). The kind of person who would play the 2016 and give it a 10/10 is generally bored of stories and just wants sheer gameplay. But in eternal, combat is background gameplay. And it tries to explain EVERYTHING. Stop, let the fans wonder why something happened or why someone did something. TL;DR: 2016: story for combat.    Eternal:Combat for story Level Design: The familiarity of human engineering and the stranger environment of mars and hell made a great combo between feeling home and feeling lost. Eternals level design feels more like it was made for a Nintendo game.And between level platforming is really not what we asked for. The heaven like nature of sentinel prime and hell like environment of earth feels more like a fantasy game. Character design: 2016 Doomguys armor made him inhuman, you couldn't tell if the person under the armor was actually a human or not, which made him look stronger. Also he didn't speak even for once (again inhuman) Eternals Doomguy is much more human and the ""Rip and Tear"" removes a lot of motive from his actions Also change in demon design made them feel more like toys rather then actual demons. Other stuff: colored ammo drops look bad, less gory, rune system was better in 2016, GIVE ME MY GAUSS CANNON BACK 5/10, 5 for beauty of combat, the flow, the power. 0 for story and other side elements"

1564,PupperDoggo,"May 20, 2020",1,"Even without considering the fact that the game installs malware, it's pretty atrocious. I understand why people are upset, but I am not here to review bomb the game because of the anti-cheat software, let me make this clear. This review is from the perspective of a 15+ year veteran of the Doom franchise. I normally play all the games on Nightmare or Ultra-Violence in the case of the classic games because infinitely respawning enemies is **** To put it bluntly, Doom Eternal is the most disappointing game since Aliens: Colonial Marines for me. There is literally nothing I enjoy about this game. From the cluttered and incoherent level design, to the neon vomit and muted weapons. The overall pacing of the combat is horrendous. Enemy encounters are often incredibly brief and segmented by poorly designed platforming sections with janky mechanics. The Doom Slayer is such a huge beefy dude, so his weightless floaty double jump is off-putting. The game's obsession with platforming is truly perplexing to me. Doom has never been about jumping. You can't even jump at all in Doom and Doom II unless you use a sourceport.The emphasis on attacking weak spots is not a welcome addition and all the abilities just bloat the gameplay and bog everything down. Doom 2016 was no masterpiece as some people seem to think it was, but at least it had streamlined combat that felt intuitive. Whoever thought it was smart to give the player a full-auto mod for the shotgun at a point in the game where the max shell capacity is 16 should not work in the industry. It is beyond idiotic. The game constantly holds the player's hand and treats him/her like a child with ADHD. Falling from a platform doesn't kill the player and when encountering an enemy for the first time, a pop up appears literally telling the player how to kill it. The game even shows the player where the giant glowing exit is. People need to stop acting like Doom Eternal is the most hardcore game ever, it's embarrassing. Sadly, the only reason why Doom 2016 came out as well as it did is because the studio was too afraid to take risks. Following the massive success of Doom 2016, their confidence was elevated to epic heights and this disaster of a video game is the result. A wise man once said ""success is the worst teacher."" In their attempt to outdo their previous effort, id Software seems to have forgotten what made Doom so much fun in the first place. Doom Eternal is excessive in the worst way possible. There are people who seem to be of the opinion that Doom 2016 was some type of masterpiece. I respectfully disagree. Every single issue I have with Eternal was present in 2016 to a lesser degree. The shoehorned pseudo RPG mechanics, the jumping, the over emphasis on glory kills etc. It saddens me to acknowledge the fact the Doom Eternal is the logical followup to Doom 2016. I would praise the game's visuals, but unfortunately, even the visual aspect of the game has been marred by id Software's blind ambition. I could say the environments are highly detailed, which is technically true, but it is to a point that I find it distracting. The PC version even suffers from major consolitis, as TAA is forced on by default and has no anti-aliasing options to speak of in the settings. Also, secrets are now tacky floating question marks. Give me a break! It just comes off as being lazy to me. Doom 2016 had a very clean aesthetic to it. All the environments felt fairly believable. This helped give the game a more grounded feeling, which I enjoyed. Doom 2016 also took a page from the book of Half-Life 2 with it's storytelling. Everything was experienced through the eyes of the Doomslayer in order to maintain immersion. Eternal does away with this design philosophy and is riddled with third person cutscenes. As for the story, it is awful and not even worth talking about. Doom feels like a parody of itself at this point. It's trying to be a service based game, such as Fortnite, with weapon skins and other cosmetic nonsense. Why would I grind for hours to get a custom skin for the Doomslayer when it's a first person shooter and I can't even see the player model outside of cutscenes (which i skip anyway). The new multiplayer mode is also destined to die very quickly."

You have no other option than use the final kill move all over and over again otherwise your resources deplete. The final execution move is the same all the time.

It's the Electric Wizard Dopethrone of video games. Doom Eternal is trying to cram as much **** as possible into it, story has to be as big as possible, hope you liked the chainsaw because it's now a central gameplay mechanic turning basic demons into rainbow treat pinatas, anything that isn't the most basic demon is killed with weakspots that the game tells you about in tutorials so don't worry about figuring things out yourself, you're doing flips and climbing walls and jumping around like an **** This is like if Dragonforce or Blind Guardian were turned into a game, cheesy, goofy, retarded story and atmosphere, mechanical wankery which some people will certainly like and respect but which to me is just in the way and beyond adding nothing of value to the previous game's experience, actively detracts from everything I liked about it. That being said, it's of course very mechanically impressive and that kitchen sink game philosophy will resonate with plenty of people.

1575,vunder,"May 12, 2020",5,"overly difficult on normal mode, easy is not much different. heavy enemies are bullet sponges and the critical attacks to make them less lethal feels bad. the weapons feel weaker across the board. just not as much freedom in play style as the last game. all down time and exploration has been replaced with very poor platforming. entire game feels like a survival  mode with constant scrounging for resources. not enough ammo and the guns are just to weak. glory kills should have given armor as well, the flamethrower is super annoying. the hub and the story are good, from an art standpoint its good, but i didn't want to buy a survival platformer with a doom backdrop and honestly with i would have just read the story online."
1576,zzz_DeV1L_zzz,"Jun  7, 2020",6,"The game is upset. I don’t know why everyone likes her so much. As if in Doom 2016 they simply introduced DLC to the new interface, improved the graphon and added a small plot, so you can make another 100 games about Doom. The game has become brighter, which of course is a minus. I wanted to see the relationship between Hayden and the executioner, but in the game there is simply zero talk. Some NPC killings, after 30 minutes already become bad and have to take a break. In the middle of the game it was already so boring that I really really wanted to finish it as soon as possible. In Doom 2016 I felt the strength of the executioner, that he really is invincible, in this game, even at normal difficulty, with the slightest error, he loses all hp. Could tell more the story of his ordinary life, but got a couple of minutes of videos that tell the story very briefly. A lot of minuses, but still playable, so 6."
1577,gyk,"May  2, 2020",5,"In DOOM 2016, the story felt much better and the game felt more serious. Here they have simplified it for some reason. Even after looking at the selection of a new weapon, before you took it by actually lifting it from the body or picking it up from the floor. This gave realism, immersion. And now some ridiculous weighing icons in the air. This kills the whole atmosphere of the dive. And there are a lot of little things like that. DOOM 2016 was head and shoulders above DOOM ETERNAL. All the good stuff was just flushed down the toilet. Yes, it's good. Killing demons is fun and the new mechanics are good. But the presentation of the story and simplification kill the whole atmosphere."
1578,Yellowlobster,"Jun  3, 2020",6,"Игра годная, но у нее есть свои хорошие, нейтральные и плохие стороны. Плохих, к сожалению, гораздо больше, чем хотелось бы.Плюсы:+ Графика. Хорошая и вполне тянет на не самых сильных машинах. Отлетающие куски от демонов - вообще шикарно.+ Геймплей. Главный и очень веский плюс. По сравнению с думом 2016, он стал разнообразнее и интереснее, а некоторые раздражающие элементы (вроде рунных испытаний) переработали. Поначалу чувствуешь себя пианистом-неумёхой ввиду обилия клавиш и привязанных к ним способностей, но, когда привыкаешь, играть становится динамично и весело. Хотя, конечно, малое количество патронов иногда подбешивало.Нейтралы:... прыжковые головоломки в духе игр-платформеров. Скажу так, они меня не раздражали, но и не радовали. Не могу понять, зачем их вообще добавили.... интерфейс и ""аркадные"" элементы дизайна. С одной стороны, цветастые интерфейс игрока и ящики патронов, а также подсвеченные секреты и подбираемое оружие облегчают ориентирование в бою. С другой стороны, они же вырвиглазные, господи.Минусы:- подача сюжета. Не скажу, что сюжет тут хороший или плохой - такая же прямая линия, как и в думе 2016, только с в разы большим размахом. Но воспринимается он гораздо хуже - катсцены в большинстве своем скучные, а вне катсцен подача довольно навязчивая. Единственная годная катсцена в игре - интро, а финальная так вобще полное разочарование.- обучение. Если хотите играть в этёрнал как в дум 2016, отключайте обучение сразу же. Оно здорово подрывает динамику, ибо разрабы решили, что на минуту переносить палача в стандартную ""тестовую комнату"" при подборе каждого нового механического элемента - норма.- элементы дизайна уровней. В целом, уровни здесь сделаны хорошо, но некоторые вещи просто ужасные. Замедляющая фиолетовая жижа и ""головоломки"" с водой и химзащитой - это худшее, что можно было сделать в думе, особенно учитывая то, что они встречаются между боями (за всю игру только один раз фиолетовая слизь появилась в боевой сцене) и просто тратят время игрока. Кроме того, некоторые арены тесные.- боссы. Честно, большую часть времени в боях с последними двумя боссами вы будете тратить на то, чтобы чистить арену от миньонов, которых они призывают (ага). Битва с финальным боссом мне показалась и вовсе затянутой на время вдвое дольшее, чем стоило бы, да и напряжения никакого. И хотя вот обычные враги стали интереснее, по сравнению с думом 2016 боссфайты упали в качестве. Возможно, дело в выбранной сложности (играл на сделай мне больно в обе игры), но в предыдущей игре все три битвы с боссами были гораздо напряженнее. В звершение скажу, что играть в новый дум нужно ради игры. Он не имеет атмосферы и ощущения целостности прошлого дума, но крошить демонов тут всё же поинтереснее."
1579,Kuner,"Jun 19, 2020",6,"Rarely have i been so split on a game. On one hand you have an interesting combat mechanic and novel approach to resource management in shooter games, and on the other hand it just doesn't feel right. In theory, everything about this game is great, but in practice it just feels wrong. The resource management mechanic forces you to play one way and one way only. Full risk, into the fray, shooting, ripping, burning, jumping. It's wonderfully intense, but it's also extremely monotonous. The old doom games featured variety, and by spreading limited ammo around the levels, and actually fare more complex and rewarding system of resource management. They tried to reinvent the wheel here, and I commend them for it, but it's just not for me, I found myself bored with the repetitive combat arenas, constantly sawing through demons or ripping them apart, then going on youtube to look up the solution for another annoying puzzle or platforming section where I overlooked one tiny hidden ledge to hold onto.  The puzzles in the original doom were a lot more fun, since they emphasized actual exploration, while constantly under threat and forced to battle monsters.The story here is also more than questionable, but i'll admit that blowing a hole into Mars was pretty damn awesome.This isn't a bad game by any stretch. It's incredibly well made and ambitious. It's just not a great doom game."
1580,CptAhnungslos,"Dec 18, 2020",5,"Bought it full price, tried to get it running as intended, gave up after 59 minutes of tinkering, got my refund. Maybe I'll come back next year, when it's patched and on a sale. 6 Month later, now it´s ""free"" on GamePass and I gave it another try.Technically impressiv, fun demon ripping and tearing BUT the jumping parts are so annoying, that I eventually gave up."
1581,Abirzenith,"Dec 29, 2020",6,"Not really a let down, but failed to meet my expectations. Imps and Soldiers are pure fodder now, they barely kite your attacks. You do the same old boring loop over and over against the same enemies, and the game is ineffective if you don't force yourself into those loop. Even in ultra nightmare it was a snooze fest where I am just doing the same thing , in same order to kill enemies. No crafting you own path to combat, no favorite gun to max out, just  a very typical take on a new version of DOOM. Id rather go play Quake champions if I wanted this type of gameplay. This game would not be anywhere near as successful if it did not stand on the shoulders of 2016, which was magnificent."
1582,pentriket,"Jan  4, 2021",0,"worse than doom 2016 in every way imaginable. if you enjoy tedium, first person platforming, and convuleted fanfiction plots you still wouldn't enjoy this. it's that terrible"
1583,Wiezzel,"Jan 14, 2021",1,"DO NOT BUY Get Doom 2016 it is MUCH better.It is everything you want to enjoy out of this game without the horrible game design , stupid story, or annoying mechanics with ammo farming."
1584,Swedgamer,"Mar 27, 2020",7,"Game is decent. Felt it needed... More Doom 4 though... More freedom, a solid arcade mode, a bit of a darker atmosphere. I played through the game 2 times on Nightmare but even though most people say it's harder than Doom 4 it felt easier for me, maybe because of the added mobility, the ridiculous amounts of spoilers i subjected myself through or simple loop which mainly consists of: Destroy weak points, prioritize targets, do fatalities for health, ammo or armor and move around like Usain Bolt. ""It's a thinking mans action game."" 666/1000"

1586,howardjmoon,"May 15, 2020",6,"Brilliant, frenetic combat that plays perfectly only my creaky 6 year old pc without even having to touch the settings. Great art, great soundtrack, the works. I would give it a 10 if they included a ""skip the annoying platforming section"" button. There's a LOT of platforming in this game, I recall more time missing jumps than blasting demons, and I just want to blast demons, not play Mario in hell. I can see why ID included platforming for pacing reasons, and it's great for folks who enjoy jumping puzzles, but for the rest of us out there it's very close to a game-breaker. For me the combat is so good I will keep gritting my teeth through those stupid platforming sections, waiting for my next dose of beautiful ultraviolence. **UPDATE** After completing the campaign and now half way through it again the jumping puzzles still annoy the heck out of me."
1587,xorbane,"Jun 18, 2020",3,"Doom 2016 is a lot better game for me. Even though I have played in a brawler style I don't like being forced to do so. I don't like the monkey bars and platforming hence it just makes no sense for a heavily armed space marine to do such silly moves especially while aiming with his gun etc, the game is not dark and scary anymore though it has no this 'suspense' and 'mystery' atmosphere, all feels like a single player to Quake 3 Arena but without a proper multiplayer mode. I could bare the Single-Player like that only as a tutorial to the very similar Multiplayer mode."
1588,quake2th,"Jun 19, 2020",2,"It's a good FPS, but I think this is a parody of Doom, that was the real intent maybe... You always run out of ammo, there are no ammo crates in the game, seriously??? Out of ammo in a Doom game?? This must be a parody, no one in the right mind would create a Doom game where you can run out of ammo during an average fight, with no powerups, no health boxes, no armor, no ammo crates, no guns (literally, there are no guns whatsoever). I guess the delay was a last resort to try to save the game, or maybe remove much of its content for political reasons, we will never know. For sure this is not the game that was advertised many months ago."
1589,Chelovek91,"Jun 23, 2020",6,"Игра очень перегружена. Я могу понять зачем вводить необходимость постоянной смены оружия,  но как будто этого было мало нужно еще и использовать несколько умений с откатом по времени. Такое должно быть актуально на высоких сложностях, но низкий дпс из-за этого не исправить сменой сложности. Если игрок не завсегдатай спинномозговых мультиплеерных шутеров, каждый бой будет для него утомительной и суматошной беготней от одного импа до другого в поисках вечно кончающихся патронов, потому что он хочет играть 2-3 пушками и не использует абилки. Это одна из претензий, но самая главная для меня. Из-за возросшего темпа все стало кислотно мультяшным, словно в мультиплеерной игре, многие ругали прошлую часть за ""серость"" но в этом хотя был стиль, атмосфера, в эти локации можно было поверить. Подытожив можно сказать, что все было подстроено в угоду новому геймплею, который можно охарактеризовать как спорный. Вся игра спорная и ни как не маст хэв, о чем кричали игровые СМИ на старте. Я убедился в этом на личном примере."
1590,mddhead,"Jun 25, 2020",5,"Maybe it's cause I was playing with a controller on PC, but the game felt really boring and tedious. You're sure not there for the story, there's zero immersion dancing around the random jungle gyms and watching colorful ammo fly out of enemies. Sure is nice the demons set up flying gapple coffins all over hell or the unstoppable slayer would be helpless! Also when tf did he get a flying battle fortress? The worst part is that the main challenge, the main gameplay, is figuring out how to swap between around a dozen different weapons, powers and abilities- Because they all run out of ammo almost instantly. There's no satisfaction when you're dreading swapping every 7 seconds, and the first few hours are constant reading and tutorials. Played 6 hours and it was just a chore. Meh."
1591,cringeyboi555,"Jun 27, 2020",6,"The marauder sucks, there's no gameplay variation, some weapons feel very overpowered, and the multiplayer is worse than doom 2016's multiplayer. Doom 2016 was amazing, because it kept the fast paced gameplay of the first 2 games and added some modern elements. There is almost no gameplay changes in doom eternal. The only thing that stops me from giving a negative review is that the game looks and runs well, and the game can still be somewhat fun."
1592,Kulkuri,"Jul  1, 2020",6,This is a Doom titled game which doesn't know who or what it wants to be. They took all the worst elements of the Doom 2016 and made those things have a bigger share of the gameplay and that way the game is less fun to play than 2016 was. There are also all these other things from other games now I didn't really sign-up for such as annoying 1st person Super Mario puzzle platforming. One of the core design innovations in original Doom games was taking out the arcade elements such as scoring and concept of lives. However Doom Eternal brings those things back and right into center of the gameplay loop. Most of it can be ignored but it's there and it does hinder the gameplay experience in my opinion. Technologically the game is amazing and it looks and sounds incredible. It works even on Linux fairly well despite no native binary being available. Visually Doom Eternal is beautiful but there is a large disconnect between the art styles of past Doom games and Eternal which causes me to become sad at times and just wanting to play the original Doom games instead of Eternal. Doom Eternal also doesn't take itself seriously enough to respect its heavy subject matter and that ruins the flow of the story it tries to tell. Some monsters have been designed to be a challenge but they are more of an annoyance and it ruins the flow of the combat somewhat when I have to start following a very specific gameplay style id Software wants to force upon me in Doom Eternal instead of me having fun and playing my way like it was possible in Doom 2016. There are some other things as well but this is the gist of my problems. It's a fun game but don't except to find a Doom game.
1593,oasdada,"Jul  9, 2020",1,"Doom 2016 was one the best games of that year.. that being said doom eternal was a downgrade in every sense possible.. downgraded gfx from the original, senseless and uninspiring level design, bland uninteresting and shallow story, and very checklist arcady gameplay that repeats the same 1min loop over and over and over! doom 2016 was a masterpiece with perfect blend of minimal but interesting story, level design that is both complex in is design and serves as a good means environmental story telling and gameplay that was a perfect blend of immersive action and arcady mechanics and the gfx were so good with lightning and pbr materials just making the world feel more real and immersive! all in all super disappointed in this game"
1594,Lizarino,"Jul 13, 2020",5,"TL:DR - Not as fun a game anymore, a lot of annoyances and downgrades from Doom 2016. I'd only recommend to buy it at -50% off or more. - Glory kills are terrible and so much worse than 2016- Ammo is shared between some guns and is sparse- Enemies can CC and stunlock you- Game is harder than it needs to be on the earlier levels- So. much. parkour. It doesn't belong here and is just an annoyance- Too many upgrade currencies and menus get overwhelming- Bad UI makes knowing when things are off cooldown harder than it needs to be- Forced to use weapons you don't want to on a lot of enemies, like a rock paper scissors- No more normal multiplayer or snapmap from 2016, replaced by a mediocre battlemode- Has a battlepass system Although I do have a lot of complaints for the game, I do enjoy parts of it and they got some things right: - Good soundtrack as always- Really well optimised, can run on almost ultra at 144 fps which a lot of games can't really do. No fps stutters or crashes- Graphics look pretty good- They added a more prevalent story into this one, although no one plays this for the story- When in combat and I actually have ammo, it's really fun most of the time- The game has some customisation with skins and such, if you are into that (although they're not serious at all)"

1600,Hexen-Slayer,"Sep 13, 2020",3,"If I wanted platforming,  I'd play Super Mario. Platforming have no place in a 3D action game. Original DOOM knew that - they did not even include a jump button which was the right way to go.Also, what's with all those colorful icons and flashing lights? It's irritating as hell. You also must kill enemies with ""glory kills"" otherwise you will be out of ammo and out of health. This is their new ""ground breaking"" game mechanic. I found it annoying. Constantly you have ""low ammo"" and ""low health"" flashing up in bright colors.Sure, graphics are stunning, but what good is it if you cannot enjoy the vistas because you are constantly bouncing around like Mario on steroids.Enemies are not scary anymore, they have been degraded to a parody of their former selves and look cartoonish: shoot a grenade into a cacodemon's open mouth and he'll gulp like a cartoon character before exploding. When you glory kill enemies, their eyes bug out like in Looney Toons. This is not DOOM anymore, it's a farce.3 out of 9 (Bad)"
1601,Zargas,"Oct  7, 2020",4,"Doom 2016 was a great reboot after the horrible Doom 3 game. Its was a fresh start and a welcome one at that.Doom eternal looked at that and decided to make Doom again BUT boring.A doom game with farming, great idea! Any speed, any fluid motion or any fun weapon handling is thrown out the door.Ammo is limited to make you do fatalities.Health is limited to make you do fatalities.Armor is limited to make you do fatalities. Are you noticing a pattern?You are constantly farming so you can have fun. The game is not hard or easy that depends on your selection but as the game wants you to play with its weapons it forces you to constantly change your weapons in fights. Fatalities are not boring, i like them i just do not like have 2 different ones and 1 farming one to make sure i can have fun. Doom is a powerhouse they managed to convey that, the dude is a PTSD to demons.However that is not how he playes.Doom 2016 was death incarnate for demons, Doom eternal is a marine in power armor.I want Doom marine from 2016 back for the next game. But with the feel of eternal please. The game is not bad, you will have fun.BUT its boring. And that is worse then bad. Dev's I dont want a farming game, that is why i dont play Asian MMO's.Please for the next game make it less of a farming simulator and more of a world ending powerhouse simulator."
1602,Halyo,"Oct  8, 2020",5,"ADHD : the game.This game would have been good if the devs hadn't substituted good, intelligent game design for pointless, repetitive gimmicks only there to fill the APM counter for ADHD people.The maps with their ennemy placement are chaotic and it's a bit hard to get an overview, so the best way to navigate them is by moving around equally chaotically to the demons, and I guess that would have been fine if the game didn't recquire you to constantly keep an eye on weaker demons, make a repetitive cutscene happen through either a glory or chainsaw kill and encourage ""variety"" for the sake of variety through gimmicks like the flamethrower. All these things are designed to make the game slow-down and re-orient the player, but in reality they only serve to further make you lose focus on your opponents and aim as well as they are over-stimulating for no reason."

The DLC doesn't seem to fare much better either."

1608,TOKYO_GHOUL_R,"Dec 17, 2020",7,"Как бы не хотелось, но придется разносить сиквел добротной игры 2016 года. Ну да ладно, попробуем постепенно, а не с горяча. 1)Упор на сюжет Не знаю зачем, но творцы из Id Software решили привнести в игру сюжетную составляющую, которую реализовали ущербно, я даже после 3 прохождения так и не до конца понял что и к чему. Накрутили вдобавок к демонам еще и ангелов, поверх них творцов и прочую ультимативную сущность, что явно не пошло игре на пользу. 2)Увеличение динамики за счет добавление вертикального геймплея. Не поймите меня неправильно, но то как они сделали платформы, на которых происходят стычки, в большинстве своем выглядит калечно и неудобно. В думе 2016 года были по сути 1-2 этажные локации, на которых было легко ориентироваться, здесь же нужно постоянно прыгать от одного этажа к другому, лишь бы не убили. Если рассматривать это с точки зрения динамики игры, то она, бесспорно, стала быстрее, но качество этой динамики лично для меня спорное, впрочем, прямо явным минусом это не назвать, но все же. 3)Баланс. Здесь все стало совсем печально, ибо проходить игру на высоких сложностях стало проблематично в виду того, что при обнулении арсенала приходится как дурачку бегать по платформам и искать мобов для того, чтобы пилой пополнить запас. Это тормозит игру и оставляет явный осадочек, плюс даже в оригинале встречаются платформы, где враги валят просто волнами неебическими(В Ancient Gods они зачем-то еще больше сломали баланс, там враги не успевают спавнится, ибо их море). Думчанский явно стал сложнее, но после прохождения локации ты не упиваешься удовольствием, а задаешься вопросами ""Какой инвалид настраивал эту игру"". 4)Музыка. Звучит смешно, но без Мика Гордона игра обеднела.Тот скандал, что не дал композитору добавить свои треки в игру, явно отразился на качестве продукта, ибо ту музыку, что состряпали за пару недель до выхода, нельзя назвать хорошей. Черт возьми, она мне вообще не понравилась и я был расстроен, когда слышал ""чужие"" мелодии при прохождении. Суммируя все вышеперечисленное можно точно сказать, что игра все-таки подойдет тем, кто полюбил DOOM 2016, но мне перепроходить игру не хочется абсолютно, даже длц не стал покупать из-за того, что оно сломанное напрочь по балансу и люди даже на средней сложности часами ковыряют одну платформу. Рекомендую к покупке сугубо по скидке, ибо за фул прайс это будет слишком больно."

1610,TheBigD-SMC,"Jan 16, 2021",5,"FUN BUT DUMB. This game is LOTS of fun. There isn't any mood, and it's just one arena battle after another. On one hand, that sucks; but on the other hand, it is FAST action, and FULL of action. Way more difficult than predecessors. On the flip side, THIS STORY IS JUST MIND-BENDINGLY STUPID. I mean, they started putting some sort of interesting story together in 2016, but this one is just amazing in its ridiculousness. It feels like the story from the original Doom back in the day (90's?); like, they made a neat game and said afterwords, ""Oh yeah. We need some story here. Where's Hobo-Carl? Give him a pen."" So as far as FUN goes, I give this game a solid 7/10; the relative scarcity of non-arena action pulls it down. As far as the rest of it goes?  Christ... 2? 3? So is it worth buying? If you're looking SOLELY for action, then yes. If you're looking for an engaging game that pulls you into it? Firm no. (I'm SLIGHTLY glad I bought it; thank God it was on sale for $20.) REVISION: All of the above is still the same, but I can't play this any longer. Got to 2/3 through, and it's just the same thing:  arena battle over and over and over. Got bored. Not gonna finish it."
1611,bblz,"Jan 21, 2021",6,"I started this game having no expectations and it turned out that this hardly is a near-perfect game like the reviews would suggest. Starting out with the good - the graphics and sound are decent and the game feels very smooth. The soundtrack is easily the game’s best part, furious industrial metal that goes really great with fast-paced arena combat. When Doom Eternal is at its best, you're jumping above demons, freezing them, chainsawing, blowing up and tearing to pieces. If you execute your combos perfectly, the game rewards you with almost a blissful state of zen in the middle of tearing down hordes of screaming demons. The catch is, this doesn't happen very often and everything else about the game is an afterthought. The story is completely artificial and a poor excuse for the gameplay. You start out in sci-fi facilities, then go through Oblivion and Skyrim-like towns, through hell, which, and I really wish I'd be joking, is now a factory and a power plant and ends in some sort of futuristic place that looks like it belongs in Destiny more than here. The main protagonist gained a base, which looks sort of like a mashup between Doom's sci-fi interiors with Warhammer. You can definitely tell Bethesda's influence in the form of Elder Scrollization of the whole game, which starts at the environment, goes through the story and ends with the NPCs, most of which have terribly weak and infantile design. On top of that the main antagonist is now some kind of a levitating mech. Who the hell thought that mashing all this stuff into a single game was a good idea? Combat got really complicated, with you having to juggle between several abilities that have cooldowns like dashing, throwing a grenade, setting demons on fire, glory killing or chainsawing them with artifically small amounts of ammo in your pocket forcing you to cycle weapons all the time. Instead of focusing on mowing down demons as fast as possible, you're now managing the health, armor, ammo, cooldowns for skills and later on also a special weapon, which I won't spoil here. There are new enemy types like the marauders that slow the combat down to a halt due to their mechanics. When you're not in an arena, the game becomes sort of a quasi-platformer puzzle where you have to climb walls, double jump and dash through pits and level geometry which more often than not is frustrating. On top of that the attention to detail in this game leaves a lot to be desired. The cutscenes are completely disjointed from the gameplay. After a fight, you're suddenly yanked from where you're standing, something happens in the environment with the camera pointing at it and then you're suddenly placed in a completely different place than you were standing before. Level design suggests to you that certain areas are accessible, while in reality you're going to bounce away from an invisible wall. The game lacks any pacing and a feel of progression. You're dropped straight into a hellhole in the middle of something and there is literally no introduction - you grab a shotgun and kill the first hell priest, one of your main objectives of the game like it's nothing. Summing it up, it's a lot like Doom 2016, just much more complicated in every aspect, partly in more interesting ways but mostly more irritating with a setting that doesn't fit the series at all. It’s a part-platformer, part-Doom, part-Quake, part-Elder Scrolls hodgepodge of mismatched elements that gets really confusing at times. And despite all of its grandiose the game still comes as very shallow. Don’t buy it for the full price, it’s not worth it, but if you’re able to get it on a sale like I did, go ahead. It’s still a decent title, which has its better moments but it's definitely not a hit like the reviews make you believe it is."
1612,TheTownDrunk,"Feb  3, 2021",2,"WTF is this? It sure as hell is not DOOM. It's got platforming! Platforming in DOOM! What degenerate moron thought that platforming should be in ANY shooter?! Actually a proper shooter should not even have a jump key/button to keep the devs from stupid ideas like platforming!!! Throughout ETERNAL you'll find these weird looking walls ripped straight out of the last three TOMB RAIDER games that you can grapple onto, ballet posts are sticking out of walls that you need to grab and monkey-swing to floating platforms from. Some platforms have traps that rotate on chains, ripped straight out of SUPER MARIO. All this really does not make a lick of sense, but here it is and it is re-fking-tarded.Another shock was the 1 Up! pickup that gives you 1 life. SUPER MARIO coming full circle? Nah, thank God they didn't go that far, it's just an instant respawn when you die instead of being bumped back to the last checkpoint. Almost had me there, ID.Slapstick cartoonish monsters? WTF?! Eyes bug out in terror when you glory kill an imp.What's with all the neon colored BS. There's constantly something neon flashing on the screen, be it colorful pickups or LOW AMMO and LOW HEALTH flashing up on screen. Be prepared to have that BS constantly flashing, since ammo is scarce and enemies hit like Mack trucks. You don't find ammo in abundance or health pickups either, nooooo. You need to glory kill enemies or use your chainsaw for health pickups to spawn from fallen enemies. Oh, yeah, the chainsaw can only be used five times before it runs out of gas.The game has you constantly bouncing around like a hyperactive toddler who's drank 10 gallons of Coke.Now they added a story. A story in DOOM. And upgrading/crafting. You get mods for armor and weapons. And mods for those mods. WTF?!DOOM ETERNAL's level design is atrocious. And it's full of BS platforming. You're more a circus acrobat than some Space Marine in power armor.It's a pity, because ID's engine is impressive, the game's visuals are stunning, top-notch and I loved the soundtrack. A pity that you cannot marvel the vistas (or you're dead in seconds) and they went overboard with the flashing HUD, flashing enemies and neon pickups. And the platforming! That;s the worst part of the game. Seriously f*** that. And crafting/upgrading/mods in a first person shooter? That's a Texas-sized HELL NO!Thank God I could refund it. Hell, I'd rather play Capstone's 1994 OPERATION BODY COUNT than this garbage! If this is ID's new trend then that's it for me. No more ID games."
1613,RagingFlasher,"Jan 24, 2021",0,"DOOM Eternal turned the game and the whole franchise into a joke that doesn't even takes it self serious.Everything DOOM 2016 achived was thrown away into the garbage; the world building, characters, story and somehow even gameplay. The gameplay in 2016 was one of the best in any FPS, it felt fluid and amazing. DOOM Eternal has, what it feels like, a fixed and static gameplay system that you can't control. Example: You are forced to use certain weapons on enemies too kill them; which ruins the famous term ""Shoot at it until it dies"" It's no longer ""shoot at it until it dies"" as you get punished for it. Biggest example (of many) are boss fights. Every boss (except the final one) is no longer dynamic like in 2016. Every boss has a fixed pattern and you have to do certain things before you can attack the boss for a *limited time*. DOOM Hunter - Destroy the shield.Marauder - Wait for the eyes to flash green.Gladiator - wait for the magic shield to go down.Khan Maykr - Forced to use the meat hook and fist before you can attack her for a limited time. The world building is by far a big let down of any game I've played. In 2016 you slowly move through Mars getting closer and closer to your destination as seen from the world, Example:On the first level you could see the argent tower from the very beginning and after each level you the tower gets closer and closer, and when you're finally there you get to climb up the whole tower.DOOM Eternal has none of that simply because you don't get to stay in one place at all. The absolute biggest issue with this games world building and immersion is teleportation.First you're on Earth, then in a different dimension, then in hell then back to earth and now you're somehow in heaven. This completly ruined the DOOM universe to me.2016 had Mars and Hell. Eternal has countless dimensions that have no place in DOOM whatsoever. And now the biggest let down for me and the biggest middle finger to 2016 is the destruction of Mars. Everything the DOOM 2016 has built up with the UAC, gone, in mere seconds, simply because of a cutscene that tried to blind the player with ""WOW, a cOoL bIg lAsSer"" while destroying the home place of the DOOM franchise for god knows whatever reason.But seeing how Eternal has chosen Fantasy over Sci-fi, I wouldn't be suprised if Mars was magically brought back. But what makes me hate Eternal the most, is the aracady direction ID went with this game. HUD/UI:The HUD looks like something you would see in a mobile game. I have no doubt that this HUD was inspired by Apex legends. EXACT same geomeotry and use of bright colors. The thing with Apex is that the bright colors are very needed for fast navigation with the ammo managment. ETERNAL DOESN'T NEED THAT. Hugo or Marty mentioned that the bright colors purpose is to distinguish the ammo, which makes absolutly zero sense as it was never needed at all. Floating props:This is something that completely annihilated the immersion this game had to offer.Floating Weapons. Floating book pages. 2 Meter long question marks. (+Fcking confetti when you walk through it).I feel sorry and bad for the people who made the concept arts and desing for the levels.Imagine making something so big and eerie just so there can be a big floating question mark in the middle of nowhere. Oversaturation of levels:DOOM 2016 had three color choices for levels to stick with: Red, Dark Green and ""cool"" colors.DOOM Eternal uses the entire color spectrum for each level. No level is easy on the eyes when it comes to the colors. Ridiculous skins:This come back to where I said ""a joke that doesn't take itself serious"".If you told me 4 years ago that the next game DOOM game would have the slayer wearing a greasy t-shirt with a ""extra thicc"" text on it I would have called you crazyI want you guys to look at 4 examples I gave you and imagine 2016 with all of that. It's simply impossible. Last thing I wanna talk about is the story.DOOM 2016 had a very simplistic story. You wake up and start killing and destroying. This is all DOOM should be. 2016 also had a cliff hanger that was for nothing as Eternal doesn't start where 2016 stopped. Hayden isn't a smart human that died of cancer and got reincarnated as a robot. Hayden is god of all of recreation. VEGA isn't a super computer that was created and tested by UAC employees (That needs absolute zero cooling btw). Vega is a god in a USB stick. I've to stop here as I've reached the limit.
DOOM Eternal has **** up the entire franchise. I see no future of DOOM whatsoever. The next DOOM should just be a mario styled arcade shooter. Just dimensions you jump from level to level killing demons in a arena with no story or a goal.

1614,Crazyivan1123,"Mar 28, 2020",7,Meh. I was a huge fan of the 2016 Doom but this plays very differently and not in a good way. The combat is excellent but I absolutely detested the jumping sessions.
1615,M_Alex,"Apr  5, 2020",5,"I've played all the major doom titles in the past, and I like this one least. Well, perhaps better than resurrection of evil, but that was a expansion pack. Its not terrible, and up to a point it was really fun. But the final third of the game is just tedious. The fights towards the end are boring, a typical rinse and repeat affair. The secrets, at first really on the nose, start being irritating to get to, particularly those to which you have to fall down. The reliance on gimmicks is too much. The platformer sections are tedious. Doom 2016 was by far a better game. I'd say that before unlocking the Empyrean Keys the game is a solid 9/10. Then it's downhill, brutally. Other than that, ammo for the, erm, big guns is rare."

Maybe consider a separate binary for multiplayer and not bother people who will never play Doom Eternal multiplayer with **** like Denuvo Anti Cheat? Shame on you! The game itself is perfect from a gameplay perspective but the level design feels so lazy and relies too heavily on the platforming. Why rely so much on platforming in a first person shooter? The story is a bit boring and leaves out a LOT of detail. A bit of a mixed bag, but with the introduction of the anti-cheat it's just not worth it anymore. I refuse to play any game that requires a Kernel-mode driver to be installed for no good reason."
1618,caleca54,"Nov  5, 2020",4,Это дум 16 года со специфичными изменениями. Объективно назвать ее хуже прошлой части нельзя но я считаю что итернал это стагнация и в общем выглядит как неудачная попытка переосмысления вызванная то ли жаждой денег то ли идиотской мыслью о том что можно будет сделать тоже самое что и 4 года назад и оно тоже выстрелит. По сути ничего координально нового в отличии от того как перевернул представление серии прошлый дум и в этом вся проблема. Нам пихают тоже самое просто под другим соусом. Отсутствие такой радушной реакции на новые изменения может даже не говорить о том что стало хуже а о том что эмоции от того дума вызваны не только качеством реализации фич но и тем что до него подобного небыло в отличии от нынешней ситуации.
1619,Midnight708,"Jun 27, 2020",2,"I've only played the opening mission and I have an overwhelming temptation to just refund the game now. I have no idea if the rest of the game is better but the start left a terrible first impression Positives first:-It has pretty good performance besides one hefty frame drop which is great.-The music is classic doom fair-The guns feel similar to their 2016 counterparts And now for the negatives:-The game feels needlessly convoluted now.The glory kill system from 2016 has been split into 3 different abilities which award either ammo, health or armour rather than all 3 like 2016's glory kill system. This change is a shame as it cuts up the honestly quite good glory kill system to seemingly do nothing but allow them to claim they added new features. Combat isn't harder or improved because of it, you just have more stuff. Stuff that I personally find less fun than the elegantly simple combat rhythm from 2016. Spending more time in cinematics kill scenes because you always need resources is not fun.Additionally, they added more movement mechanics for platforming sections. From the feedback id received from the first game making the doom slayer into spiderman was something I imagine didn't come up much if not ever. The wall latch in particular just looks weird in action and I now understand why most games with climbing aren't in first person.-Ammo economyThis might be an early game problem as I only had 2 guns unlocked when I stopped playing but you are almost constantly running out of ammo and there's no pistol with infinite ammo to swap to if you run dry. Ammo economy was never something I considered in Doom 2016, I always had a plentiful supply of shots in at least one of my guns so I could keep swapping between them and never have to worry about finding ammo as you picked it up from kills and glory kills. Here acquiring ammo is locked to the chainsaw (which thankfully recharges) and pickups from the map. This is mixed with a low carrying capacity which causes ammo economy to be a constant issue. Having to worry about where I am going to get more bullets to blast demons with feels antithetical to the never stop shooting combat loop from the first game.-Story and world-buildingI'll admit I never paid a huge amount of attention to the story from Doom 2016 and didn't read the lore from that game. However, starting Doom eternal made me wonder if I had missed a game because you suddenly have a space station and have to worry about the demon priests worshipping a robot angel called the Khan Makyr. To the best of my knowledge, neither of these plot elements appeared in Doom 2016 so just suddenly having both of these thrust at you with no setup or explanation feels jarring and confusing. The space station in particular just feels like a lazy way of implementing a hub area because there was probably a cool story of how the slayer got access to it but no, you're just there and that's it. Also the fact there is what looks to be a hub area is concerning to me, you return to it after the first mission, which didn't have a boss or a remotely fun conclusion. You went into a tower, up a lift and had a cutscene then went to the station. This makes me worried that the rest of the game will be like this and constantly returning to a hub will ruin pacing.-While the music is great I did not like the default sound balance as I could not hear it properly over the guns and enemies.-Some weird keybinds, grenade was on ctrl by default for some reason.-You need to sign into some Bethesda account in order to even play the game. If I don't refund the game and play the rest I'll update the review."

1621,DrShepherdLIVE,"Jul  4, 2020",4,"Why I give it a 4/10:Its like Fast Food. It tastes good and it smells good in the beginning. Its all made so you buy it.Sensational so to speak. And while playing it you think. ""not bad"". But you always wait for that ""click"" or that ""wow"" effect. But it never comes.Its all just a trick. Like Fast Food. You feel satisfied, but only for a couple of hours and then you are hungry again and you body didnt even get enough vitamines and nutritions.Same can be said about DE. It is so hyped you think the game playing will be a great experience.But it is just playing Mortal Kombat for 20 hours straight.No real highlights in the story whatsoever.Beating monsters has to follow a rotation cause you need to use the chainsaw. You NEED to use that weapon and NEED to switch to a different one all the time.If you dont learn and train your muscle memory you will have a hard time beating the game on a higher difficulty.It feels like somebody fired the genius from the company and now the ones that are left are trying to fill up the gab of creativity and ideas whit whatever they have.Thats ID 2020.Game is probably a 6.5 but I see that all the fanboys are giving it a 10/10 which is nonsense. But it isnt a 0/10 either. So a 4 is low enough to not be unfair and not high enough to camouflage the hype and fanboying this game gets for no reason."
1622,SchindlersFist,"Jul 15, 2020",0,"It's astounding to me just how much this game doesn't want you to have fun. Did you enjoy jumping around shooting enemies in whatever order you like with whatever weapons you want? Too bad. Did you like going into a room, clearing it and happily heading to the next segment to kill even more stuff in interesting arenas? Too bad, you get invincible enemies, enemies that can only be killed by playing the way Bethesda wants you to play, low ammo forever, next to no carrying capacity for ammunition, and a bunch of awful cooldowns. No more fun, you only play the way they want you to and you have no other option or you will die forever. No room for creativity, no flexibility. F*** Bethesda, this should've been a slam dunk, ""Just DOOM 2016 with a new campaign"" would have been perfect. DOOM 2016 was a masterpiece and they've gone against every design rule that made DOOM 2016 stand out and be amazing. This is worse than if they had just cranked out a generic FPS game. They utterly ruined this. Won't be buying any sequel. **** BETHESDA."
1623,angrywombat,"Jul 28, 2020",4,"Nothing like Doom 2016, all the fun grinds to a halt as the designers force you to “play it their way” by using weak spots on enemy’s as the only way to kill them, super low amounts of ammo so you have to keep chainsawing then for more, uninspired levels too."
1624,ZeroBANG,"Aug  1, 2020",4,"After being a huge fan of Doom 2016... i absolutely hate everything about Doom Eternal. - They dropped Snap Map, have not bothered to replace it with any other kind of Modding tools or support... BOOO! Companies like id and Bethesda in particular should know the immense value of a vibrant modding community, after the lackluster 2016 Snap Map i expected them to step up their game and learn from their mistakes, instead they just dropped it and did nothing. - Battlemode sucks ass. Maybe 1 in 10 matches results in something i would call ""fun gameplay"", you either roflstomp noobs or get roflstomped like the noob that you are.In comparison, Doom 2016's multiplayer was not well received but after the 6.66 patch that made the Season Pass content free and revamped the progression system i think it was really well rounded and fun mode. It was no Quake of course but it was worth playing an hour here or there... with Battlemode i just feel like i'm wasting my time to grind XP for that stupid Battlepass, it is not fun, it is not good. - Singleplayer, 2016 was a standout game, GOTY material, i played it start to finish at least 5 times and then some.I am not gonna while about running out of ammo in Eternal, instead i want to point out that it is indicative of the overall bad game design. The first level they hand you only 2 guns, you get the minimum amount of ammo pool from the skilltree which makes it that much more important to understand how the chainsaw works or you gonna have a bad time. Anybody coming from Doom 2016 who get interrupted by a tutorial screen about how a chainsaw works is gonna be arrogant enough to think ""i played so many hours of doom, thank you i know what i'm doing"" and then the game proceeds to kick your ass for it. Later i got the flamethrower, didn't understand why it only spat out a tiny flame, was i pressing the button wrong? Do i need to upgrade it? ... it felt wrong, a flame thrower is a weapon and it shoots out a consant stream of fire. So i thought it was just a weapon that sucked and played the next 3 levels without using it at all...  well i had a lot harder time playing without the ARMOR that drops from enemies on fire... because that is the most intuitive thing ever, set a guy on fire, collect kevlar bits for your Space Marine armor totally a logical thing to expect what a flamethrower does, right? This type of gimmicky and unintuitive design is true for practically the entire game.They re-invented the wheel, added a ton of gimmicks that no one asked for ...when they had a winning formula already. I'm mad this is not the continuation of the 2016 game... but i'm more mad that the game is just and exercise in frustration. The level design is not on par with 2016, it is much more linear and interrupted by jumping sequences, there is even one level, i kid you not where you don't get to fight any demons, but have to listen to exposition and then collect a TON of CODEX ENTRIES... literally text, and if you want to have any chance of understanding what even goes on in this convoluted mess of a story then you better read all of it. ...and if you think remembering the names of the Hobbits is hard you have seen nothing yet. Doom 2016 literally punched the exposition in the face before the game even started, that was a mission statement for the entire game, there was a bit of story here and there but in Eternal it is constantly in your face, interrupting you and even better none of it makes any god damn sense unless you really dig into the codex text files... in my eyes when you make me read text in a videogame, you failed at making a videogame, i do not need a multimillion dollar game and year of R&D high tech CPUs and RAM and GPUs and 4K HDR 5.1 Surround Sound... to be entertained by TEXT... a storytelling format that works on a piece of PAPER.Do they think this is Mass Effect now? Codex Entries in a DOOM game, what a joke... if those existed in 2016 then they were not this annoying.Even reading them is a pain because of all the weird names.in 2016 we had a few places with buttons that you pressed and a Demonic voice would tell you a story, that was atmospheric and fit together with the interactive Metal soundtrack of the game so well they put it in the soundtrack.That demonic voice doesn't exist in Eternal. But i hear a lot of teenage girl voices recording log entries or playing holograms with the lamest cringy lines you've ever heard. ...and yet between the 80% of the game that are either lame, cringe or infuriatingly frustrating... there is some good DOOM gameplay trickeld in with it that is actually fun enough to keep me suffering through the bad, which makes me unable to drop it.But while i burned through 2016 in a mad rush and then played it 5 more times, it's been months and i have not even finished Doom Eternal yet."

1626,studentLoan,"Aug 11, 2020",2,"I am largely a big fan of id Software as their games got me into programming/3D engines etc. I have enjoyed Quake, Quake 2 and Quake 4. I did not like Wolf3D though I appreciated the raycast engine for the time, I did like Doom (Original DOS doom) but I liked games like Heretic and Hexen more for some reason. So my friend bought me this game (pre ordered) and I have a decent gaming rig (2070 super, 2k 144hz gsync monitor with amd 3700x) and I appreciate the engine and the way the game runs, I also appreciate the gameplay and mechanics to some degree but this game was putting me to sleep, for my friends sake I played through this game and disliked it so much that I created a Meta Critic account just to review this game. I wouldn't call this game total garbage, it's fantastic from some perspectives but as a game it just is too dull, and the art direction was very limited and not atmospheric. I also did not like Doom (2016), I liked Doom (horror one) slightly but all in all after playing so many more games I would say this game is just not worth buying or playing for that matter, it is just fueled by nostalgia and other emotions that lead to nonobjective and dishonest experiences. I disliked the level art diversity of environments but that said I liked Control which has very little to no environment diversity.  The art and visuals also looked dated and it was tough to appreciate this as I was just playing Kingdom Come Deliverance/CODMW which looks tons better. Though the Doom engine runs smooth as butter, it's important to remember it's not really doing much, levels are constrained, visuals are lackluster. Sad dated shader effects etc"

1628,kindlerob,"Sep  8, 2020",3,"Doom E starts off quite good but becomes tiring & tedious very quickly. I will just say now that Doom was a hard act to follow. It had an addictive balance like no other. The balance is not here at all. It's harder, faster, longer, less atmospheric, & even the story is an over-bloated mess of Cult-clichés. Once the upgrades are out the way, & you have another second half a game to wade through in precisely the same manner as the first, it becomes frustratingly frenetic. Every level is far too long, battles always involve waves of many enemies which increases predictably each time, & the weapons are set to kill particular enemies is particular ways. If you do not kill them in the way the Developer has premeditated; you die quicker. This takes away all the fun of the original - where every gun was an over-powered cannon of devastation. The Devs seem to think that Challenge, equals, enjoyment. Even on Easy, it is a frantic mess, where everything bombards you if you stop moving, & by getting stuck on any of the surroundings results in your demise. This makes for a game, not of skill, but of luck. The graphics: are large, colourful, & detailed. Probably what they concentrated on the most. Yet the touch-screens & on-screen data pads have once again reverted to squint-inducing thumbnails. The Guns & pickups are bright & treat you like an idiot. (The first game did it better!) The environments are nice when bright & open, but soon revert to corridors, alcoves & lift-shafts. Many don't feel like Doom in any sense, because all of the Religious ramifications they see fit to shove down our throats constantly. The Story:It's daft! Call me simple! But Doom guy always seemed like a modest soldier down on his luck; sticking UP for his species, to me. A guy so neglected by society & Military hierarchy, he didn't even have a name. He busted out of confinement, got himself a gun, & had no alternative but to become a badass to defend his outpost! Now, they want to turn him into another ‘Dr Who’ Jesus Christ saviour figure. It takes away ALL your intrigue; knowing that everything you do has been ordained & is your destiny. I don’t want to play in this universe anymore. It’s stuffy, irrational, superstitious, & ostentatious. It totally bogs the game down for the sake of trying to make sense of a totally implausible situation. Just because you CAN achieve something, doesn’t mean you SHOULD do it. If you are in control of your skill & technique, you are thus liberated from it. But here, the technique is in control of the game’s structure. The Audio is a mixed bag. Some sounds are an improvement such as the Aslt Rifle, whereas the Ballista is so underwhelming that you hardly notice it upon releasing the trigger! You knew when The Gauss Cannon fired! BOOM! The music is a disaster. A total calamity. There is no quality control. There are a few standout tracks in the game that are indeed very good, if strictly suited to this universe of carnage! But apart from the fact they are truncated, they are all re-engineered & mixed badly – fatiguing you, due to the Loudness Compression of already loud music. There are times where I had no alternative but to turn off the music in the options menu! Repeating a single phrase over & over offers nothing creative & is an insult to all those composers who over-composed to fit every possible situation.There are a lot of tracks which seem to be more ‘sound fx’ than music. These grate on you so bad, it just sours the experience. I liked the energy in more aggressive tracks during combat, because it makes sense. But when you are just trying to wade through all the mundane jumping routes, you just want something mellifluous & expansive. Although I completed this game, I have no desire to return. A strange reaction, considering the original had the opposite effect & kept me coming back for another playthrough. There is just so much wrong with how this game was built, that it begs the question of competence. The entire game is now segregated & laid out into wave-bars in the top right hand corner – letting you know exactly how far you are, how many more waves, unique areas, etc. you have left; removing any connection to the world, & to the discovery. It tells you right at the start! Doom2016 felt like a journey, with exploration, & a narrative being created as you progress.It reminds me of Gears of War Judgement – where they forced the Wave system into the main story campaign. You’d be constantly concentrating on perfect scores, head shots, & other pointless gimmicks when I should just be enjoying the experience. DoomE is exactly the same. You’ll get to the end of a typically protracted level, just to be faced with a “You SUCK!” score board of missed secrets, failed challenges, incomplete waves, & “The Princess is in Another Castle”."

Furthermore, your reload button is a chainsaw. That's right, you have to switch weapons to reload in this game, and even worse, the chainsaw runs out of fuel so you have to constantly get glory kills too!

1632,Steyraus,"Oct  1, 2020",5,Personally this game was a massive letdown for me. While the first game was a ballet of blood and guts and effects the second game feels like a awkward game of checkers and balancing ammo and health and having the right Weapon at the right time. By no means a bad game but when everyone wanted more of the same we were given something completely different and I don't know why this is a huge disappointment from what the first game was in my opinion
1633,Testsson,"Feb 12, 2021",0,"Edit: lowering the score as I went back and played previuos Doom games and felt Eternal was more flawed The bad:A big step down from Doom 2016. Doom 2016 made a joke in the very beginning about over convuluted story and toses that right out the window for the sake of well put together action gameplay. Here they went the opposite direction. Why?You are forced to play a certain way and that includes running away a lot and farming ammo/health/armor. After that you attack some more then farm again. Rinse and repeat. I played on Nightmare and difficulty was good for me. But I caught myself feeling it was more of a chore, a homework, to engage in combat rather than having fun. Dont get mer started on the jump puzzles. Too many mechanics for a simple but perfected action game. Its like they didnt know what to do with their sequel and just put everything they had from the 'idea box' and with the success of Doom 2016 there were no nay-sayers during development. The stages feel very 40k warhammer esque and not grounded in real world future as Doom 2016. Ammo and weapons pop like a childred cartoon show and doesnt fit well with the overall style. Story is there were no one asked for it, nor is it needed in a Doom game. The funny thing is that the developers became the very joke they themselves made about ""unecessary story arcs"" joke in Doom 2016. Doom isnt a story driven game as other very deep and captivating story games can be. In Doom 2016 it was handled perfect with juuust about the right amount. Here it is suuddenly very important and serious and edgy but that just results in ""gringe"". Doomguy shouldnt be anything else than a normal guy (who doesnt speak!!) who overcame the odds with his skill with weapons and lust for killing demons. No deep story, no prophecy, no ""the one"" BS. The good:Still good looking albeit worse in design than 2016. Very optimized for such a good looking game. Sound is very good. Action is sometimes fun."

Steam had an update on the game and since then i cant launch the game. Obv I cant refund it, so i talked to bethesda support. i was exchangin emails on the steps i should do and i did. The support had 0 clue on how to help. I noticed they were repeating the steps that they told me to do. I did them no questions asked.Its been 2 weeks and i havent heard from the since they told me that ""a specilised team will look into your problem"". I am not satisfied with bethesda at all. And this proves that even if your game works fine at the beginning  they wont actually help you from their part.PS: My pc specs are sufficient to run the game and on high graphics as well. last game i played it was on june (i think) when i tried on 1st of august the game wasnt launching."

Мобы с идиотическими механиками их убийств(надеюсь в реальном аду нет этого урода с зелёным глазом). Неинтересные боссы с дурацкими и сложными способами их убийств.

1641,philzlz,"Mar 18, 2021",6,"The game runs incredible well and looks the part. Unfortunately I thought the 2016 Doom was better, I wasn't a fan of the constant ammo shortage and movement focus. While I get what they are going for id rather just shoot demons and shut my brain off for a few sessions. Using the chainsaw and glory kills just gets annoying after a while. The soundtrack on the other hand was just awesome, the heavy metal electric guitar riffs pump you up and you get into a kind of trance like state while running around the map."
1642,BreezyBadger,"Mar 28, 2021",4,"This isn't a sequel to DOOM 2016. If it wasn't called DOOM, then it wouldn't get a bad review. They should of called it Single Player MOBA Boomer Shooter: Wait for Cool-downs and farm trash mobs. I'm serious: the most important part of this game is farming weak monsters for health, ammo and armour. They infused the razor sharp core DOOM game-play, of: dodge, shoot and murder, with pointless accounting. Every single mechanic that was added to this game that wasn't already there in DOOM 2016 is basically cool-down dependent tedium that just gets in the way. This is like DOOM 2016 if the DOOM slayer had to periodically take a break from killing a mancubus to do his taxes, take a piss, flame then chainsaw imp for ammo and armor, punch a random zombie for health, and then go back and do a bit more damage to the mancubus before running out of ammo. And then having to repeating the tedium all over again. The DOOM slayer can't just feed the ugly bastard a steady stream a missiles until it pops, like the in the good old days. No. First, shoot the fist guns, on each hand, because those are the first 2 ""weak spots"", then you can finish it off. Do it any other way and you run out of ammo, because all other parts of the body, other than the arbitrary weak spot, take almost no damage before the weak spot ""check-boxes"" are ticked off. This applies to all ""big"" monsters. DOOM 2016 gave you a problem, a box of tools, and then let you decide how to best murder everything. DOOM Eternal gives you a problem, a rusted, barely functional, set of tools, and a very rigid and convoluted procedure to follow. Try and use the tools any other way than for the intended ""problem"" (weak spot) and you realise your weapons are actually dollar-store water guns that shoot piss and glowing dog turds. There had to be better ways of raising the skill ceiling of the game without the boring MOBA cool-downs, and redundant rock-paper-scissors."
1643,CoreGamer1408,"Aug 13, 2021",6,"OMG WTF!? Doom Reboot was fun enough in the gameplay department. Doom 3/BFG had a solid atmosphere. The simplistic nature of all the previous DooMs' was why they are fun. Eternal has got no fun factor or atmosphere. Melee kill a demon/creature and it explodes like cartoon pinata. I want blood, I want guts, not cutey colored lights ffs. Eternal basically came across as Quake on x2 speed. Ammo was low so ammo soft locking was problem. It was a chore to play, had no atmosphere, zero feeling of being a bad ass like 2016 Reboot.  Plus the DooM Guy aka regular joe is now some epic Master Chief character the DooM Slayer. Oh no CoD type story cutscenes BS. Thanfully 2016 kept that crap to minumn and told the lore in optional text. Yeah it looks ok and runs at solid 60 FPS.  Came across as nothing special. This reminds me like mobile game setup, whoa."

1645,tacsquid,"Feb  6, 2021",6,"I really wanted to like this game. I only played it for about 90 minutes and returned it so maybe it gets better later on. There were a significant number of jumping puzzles and with a double jump and double dash it got stupid fast. Having to figure out how to double jump to a platform that drops into lava in one second and then in that 1 second find the next spot to jump too oh too late you hit the lava. Do all that jumping **** again. I played up until I got to a level where literally I did like 30 minutes of jumping puzzles. I wanted to quit but couldn't because i wasn't sure if it was going to save what checkpoint I was at and force me to restart the stupid jumping puzzle heavy level. I cannot emphasize how much I **** hated the jumping and dashing puzzels. On top of that instead of bringing in new colors and environments it's ""hell on earth"" so instead of being new and exciting it's the same dumb browns and reds because they brought hell to earth. Such a dumb design decision. Weapons feel under powered and are not satisfying and you carry a hilariously small amount of ammo for each one. I paid like $96 for the game with the year one stuff and honestly I'd probably never play this game again the jumping and dashing puzzles annoyed me so much."
1646,Tk4Bullet,"May 31, 2021",0,"I can't say I enjoyed it, I loved Doom 2016, bui this one seems to be more about puzzle, jumping and finding a way to progress further, with which I had no problem in previous Doom. I died more because of falling down than in combat."

1648,TwiTu,"Oct  1, 2021",0,"This isnt Doom. Period.And no, this isnt about the DRM drama.I wasnt a big fan of the last Doom either, but at least it was playable and still felt like a shooter. I played the other Doom games thousands of hours, even competitively.But this game is completely built around 3 mechanics that are not very shooter-like: The Chainsaw, Glory Kills and Platforming/finding secrets.It is so annoying and stupid that it destroys the whole game as a shooter. You literally have to chainsaw and glorykill your way through hordes of monsters and the whole game. You cant even use your weapons properly because they run out of ammo all the time. And so you always have to use the chainsaw and be bored of the not very diverse killing animations very quickly. Even after my first 5 kills I was already getting bored of this mechanic. Then you get a few bullets for maybe one or 2 kills, and then you gotta chainsaw again. And so on. Again and again. Ridiculously boring.And then of course Glory Kills. You gotta do them to stay alive because you get health back when you kill a monster, or you sometimes have to kill them with a glorykill to kill them quicker (because everyone knows that a fist to the face is much more powerful than a few bullets in said face). They are as boring as the chainsaw. But you gotta do them. Just like chainsaw kills. Youre forced to.Makes sense, doesnt it? No?Well then youre like me, and your game must at least make a little sense. Killing a monster with your weapons and not getting ammo from it... fine. But then killing it with the chainsaw and ammo literally (!!!) pops out of it like from a pinata?Yeeeeaaaahhh... no thanks.Lets get to the other gameplay then. Weapons can be upgraded. That sounds good and is actually fun. But as I said, you cant enjoy it for long because you run out of ammo all the time.And then theres the sounds of the weapons. All Doom games (except the last one, where it was similar like here) and even other shooters have the weapons dominate the game sound. Naturally weapons like those would be very loud, and thus sound very powerful. In some games I got goosebumps from only the weapon sounds alone. But here? They sound like toy guns. Their sounds are ridiculous and extremely low. Which brings me to the other sounds... or rather music:Extremely annoying comes to mind. I mean there are a few good tracks, but they dont last long. Most of the time you hear some weird ass scratching and screeching that is neither ambiance nor music. Its just annoying as hell! No pun intended. Platforming. Right. When youre not busy glorykilling and chainsawing away, while letting one or two bullets fly in between, you have to jump from one platform to the next and look for secrets. As simple as it is boring and annoying. Because secrets give you points that you then spend for upgrades. And btw, those upgrades are also ridiculous, because your character is overly artificially weak at the start because hes missing them. You literally feel much weaker than in the last games. For a long time. For example you maximum health is very low at the beginning and and can only carry extremely little ammo (16 shotgun shells and 60 bullets, for example). Finding those secrets sometimes gets really annoying when you spot a way to a secret (or another part of the map), but then discover that its not the real intended way and to make sure you dont use it, its blocked by a.... you guessed it, invisible wall. Happens quite often if you like to explore (which you have to if you want to find the secrets). Thats just pathetic for a modern game. The controls also feel very weird. Possibly because Bethesda decided to add something called ""mouse sensitivity scaling"". At first I thought its something like mouse acceleration, but when you turn it to 0.1 (the lowest), then you wont turn at all anymore. Must really be some form of sensitivity scaling, which really doesnt make any sense, because anything else than 1:1 on a shooter like that (or any game) is just stupid. But they dont make it in such an easy to understand scaling (1:1), they use decimals that dont make sense. You also have some citadel floating in space where you store your found secrets (easter eggs) and buy upgrades for your character.Thats all it does. Yet you can still get lost in it.Nothing impressed me there, because Ive been playing the old Doom games on and off on more modern engines, and see and hear everything they showcase there anytime I want without having to find it in some level. Ive been very disappointed by Bethesda games in the last few years. But this one pretty much seals it for me: I wont ever buy one of their games again, unless, for some reason, I am 100% sure that its a good game. And looking at their track record, I highly doubt that will ever happen again. Because for some reason enough people condone this raping of good old IPs and soulless gameplay. Not only in games, but also in series and movies."
1649,BobbyObrien,"May 31, 2021",9,"Doom Eternal is criminally fun. This fast-paced FPS gives you so many new interesting weapons and gadgets that it can almost feel overwhelming. Even though Doom Eternal gives you so many new bells and whistles it still felt challenging at times as enemies took a lot of damage to kill(I did play on ultra-violence difficulty so that could be why), but you still feel like your doing a lot of damage because peace's of the demons flesh will fall off them which makes you feel incredibly powerful without making the game easy. This game has an interesting story that I didn't care too much about. What really kept me coming back was the gameplay. This game improves on Doom 2016 in so many ways. If you liked Doom 2016 you'll absolutely love Doom Eternal."

1652,antihero1969,"Dec  9, 2020",7,"If the 2016 Doom was a retelling of the original Doom, then this one would be a retelling of Doom 2, since the former took place on Mars and the latter took place on Earth. I struggled with coming up with a score for this one, because there are things I really love about it and things I really hate. What I love -- it looks great and sounds great, and it's fun to just blast the hell out of everything. What I hate -- There are too many spots in this game where you have to rely on a serious of fancy jumps, and if you miss, you might have to go back and do all the other ones again because apparently the game developers thought that gamers were saying, ""You know what I really hate?  Being able to save my game whenever I want to!""  Which also gets frustrating when you get to a point where a seemingly endless wave of enemies keeps coming at you.  A challenge is one thing, but there were a few spots where I was stuck for more than was enjoyable because I was running around, killing everything, trying not to get hit, for what seemed like an eternity, only to get killed and have to go back to the beginning because again, no save option.  I know the 2016 didn't let you save either, but I don't remember ever getting stuck in the same spot for too long.  I actually gave up on some of the side challenges on this one because I got frustrated after awhile and just wanted to move on. As I do with most games, I start out with what I perceive as the ""medium"" setting.  I think if I decide to play through this one again, I might try the easiest one. As with the previous game, there isn't much of a storyline.  Not saying that's a bad thing, just personal preferences.  Maybe  a little more of a storyline than the originals, but not as much of one as Doom 3."

Your ammo depletes fast and you have to switch weapons constantly to survive. Even though it's a dynamic shooter, the game constantly encourages you to move from place to place in order to stay alive and kill all these demons. I'd say the game did not fulfill my expectations. The whole new platform-like movement system is just too absurd for a shooter game and that's why I'm giving it only 6. The previous game was better since it focused on one thing that counts in such games: SHOOTING."

1677,Maurdekye6,"Apr  9, 2021",10,"Contrary to initial impressions, DOOM Eternal is not an action game; it is a puzzle game. Where a casual observer might watch high-level gameplay and only see the flurry of bullets and cacaphony of targets whizzing by the screen, the player sees a totally different picture. Instead of just seeing targets, they see priorities. Instead of just dodging, they're thinking about the order of their actions, which resources to manage, how to most effectively keep them up, when to engage, when to run, and who to kill first. Every encounter is like a new puzzle to solve. Every arena consists of two categories of enemies; fodder, and heavies. Fodder enemies, typically imps, soldiers, and gargyoles, are hardly threats. They have small health pools, make little effort to dodge your attacks, and generally go down in a few small-arms shots. However, they serve a different purpose; they are easy prey to use your various resource-management abilities on. Use a glory kill on one to get health back, use a chainsaw to get ammo, or use the flame belch to get armor. Because these enemies are quick to kill, respawn indefinitely, and pose little threat, they exist not as targets, but as resource nodes to fall back on after running your guns dry, or getting low on health and armor. No; in a given arena, the real threat are the heavies. The heavies and super heavies are the real center of an arena. Unlike fodder, they have much larger health pools, more mobility, and generally much more dangerous attacks. The doomslayer's priority on entering any arena is killing the heavies as fast as possible. Doing so is not always so cut and dry; each heavy usually has a unique weakness or strategy to exploit, with which the doomslayer must respond to accordingly: cacodemons can be made to swallow a sticky bomb with precise timing, staggering them instantly; the hell knight has a particular weakness to the chaingun, making him falter more than any other weapon; and the most contentious enemy of all, the marauder, must be fought one-on-one in a very particular manner, countering his attacks and staying at a specific range. Taking all of this into account while fighting the heavies, as well as considering your ammo, health, and armor, and where the nearest fodder enemies are should you need to temporarily retreat and restock, makes up the bulk of the game's combat loop. Mess up once on nightmare, and you're a dead doomslayer. That's not to say you don't need a good base in FPS skill to play this game well; actually hitting your targets is just as important as knowing which targets to shoot. That skill floor might put off some less experienced fps players. But if you think you can handle it, the challenge DOOM Eternal presents is well worth it."

1697,Alexhrytsak09,"Apr 12, 2021",10,It's the greatest first person shooter i've played. I love the gameplay soo much.
1698,TomatoOne539,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"Gone is the chaotic randomized onslaught of the previous Doom title. This games drills you hard in asset management, weapon and mod switching, and harvesting lesser demons for the resource you need at the moment. It may seem tedious or hard to learn at first, but once you get it, the game becomes easy flowing and immensely rewarding. Instead of the mindless shoot-them-all of the old days, you get a game of tactical, prioritized, laser focused elimination. This long time gamer is happy to see that three decades since their first FPS, id can still deliver an experience that feels fresh. The key to not becoming an old dog is looking forward to new tricks."
1699,MrTmypitty420,"Apr 12, 2021",10,What did you do id software after this game I can not imagine myself playing DOOM 2016. This game is so good thanks for it.
1700,RedAngel121,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"I am an experienced FPS player, I have been playing FPS games my while life. I played on normal difficulty and still got my ass handed to me every 10 minutes, and it was worse in the Expansion packs. Definitely a good game to play to sharpen skills and focus on key combos. Go ahead, Rip and Tear, until it is done."
1701,JoshuaTow888,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"One of if not my favourite game of all time, the replayable value is amazing and for a single player game within a week I gathered a hundred hours on it trying to complete it in ultra nightmare no criticism of it other than the multiplayer which is quiet bland but other than that it is worth buying."
1702,Justin7997,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"10/10 DOOM Eternal takes everything that made DOOM (2016) great and enhances every aspect of it. I have been playing through the DLC's on nightmare and it is absolutely brutal. The difficulty is intense and fast paced and your controls and mechanics all synergize so perfectly to keep you alive and slaying no matter what obstacle you are facing. The base game is fantastic with a lot of secrets and parkour puzzles as well as the normal demon dismembering chaos. For gods sake you get ammo back by using a chainsaw on your enemies.. how can you get more badass than that? The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard from any piece of entertainment whether it be a video game/movie/tv show ect. I can not recommend enough, I am almost done with the first DLC and I cant wait to finish the second!"
1703,LilMil109,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is all around good. It has great enemy design, weapons, pacing, music and level design. It a game that embraces creativity. You find what weapons and combos work best for you. It a really fun action shooter."
1704,Robin226,"Apr 12, 2021",10,"I love this game the graphics are amazing, the glory kills are expanded if you can get this game I recommend it so much! The only thing wrong with this game is that some of the bosses are surprisingly easy the most times your gonna die is when your overwhelmed and getting some special glory kills are kinda hard to get, such as a ""back"" glory kill on a tyrant is really weird, but those are the only complaints in this game I strongly recommend this!"
1705,Borkiboi37,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"I really like this game, but the fast paced combat and complicated game mechanics are just too much for my caveman brain."
1706,Magnus58,"Apr 13, 2021",10,The game makes my crotch sweat. Feels like being on cocaine. That's pretty good.
1707,Xgoing9,"Apr 13, 2021",10,If you want to play as an BEAST ripping through demons and zombies trying to eat the earth than you'll love this game. I can't wait to see what comes next in this epic ass game.
1708,Zebruh1,"Apr 13, 2021",10,Not the longest game ever but it has 2 expansions and a lot of replayability. Really good.
1709,Storm6,"Apr 13, 2021",10,One of the few great modern AAA games. The game is pretty dam amazing. I loved everything about it.
1710,Suupple43,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"If you're looking for a game where you are the demon king... this is the game for you. Its like halo, where the grunts run from you in terror, except you you also rip enemies arms off and shove them back down their throat mortal combat style. 10/10."
1711,Snipergetdown11,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"Quick Rating: 10/10 Full Thoughts:Doom Eternal is the best feeling and designed first person shooter that I have probably ever played. The combat has immense depth to it while maintaining the simplicity of move and shoot. The combat of the game has taken everything about what made Doom 2016 a fantastic game and ramped it up to 11. No longer do you simply sprint around the battlefield and arbitrarily shoot demons until they die but not each weapon has a unique purpose in efficiently dealing with a specific demon. Id has turned the fast paced action and turned it into a unique puzzle that you most likely wont find in another game. The game has so much depth and fantastic replayability. The multiplayer isnt fantastic but is a fun unique arena shooter experience in its own right. I have completed the base game with defeating all 6 slayer gates and completed both DLC's. I have gotten nothing but euphoria from this game and each challenge is difficult and thrilling. What Holds the Game Back:This is not a casual game at all. If you are looking for something that you can sit back and not really pay attention to this game is not for you. Additionally, the game is very unforgiving on its difficulty you will not complete this game without putting a good amount of focus and effort into. You have to learn the combat systems and learn how to move, shoot, and glorykill very efficiently. Closing Remarks:A perfect score does not mean a perfect game. My scoring of a 10/10 reflects that this game is the shining gold standard of its genre. In the future I will compare almost every shooter I play to Doom Eternal. This game sets the bar high for what can be achieved in first person shooters in our day and age and I'm very excited for what Id will cook up now that they are finished with the story of the slayer."

1713,Baconsworth3,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"Thought this would be similar to 2016. It wasn't. It railroads you into the fun zone so hard, hell's economy crashed. Action GOTY 2020. 666/420 would rip and tear again"
1714,EvilPogo81,"Apr 13, 2021",10,Best shooter ever best action game ever. Best soundtrack ever created for da angry man!
1715,BluePhoenix58,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"I love this game, It is very enjoyable. I am almost done with this game as I think I'm on the second to last level as of writing this but this game has massive replay ability as you are just murdering multiple types of enemies and all of them are very unique. based off of a arsenal of weapons that you get as you go on. You also have grenades and freezing grenades and a flamethrower on your arsenal at all times. There are some puzzles to mix in a tiny bit of a break from ripping spines from demons, they are simple but they at least require a few braincells to complete. I totally recommend this game, it is very intense action just running around and killing demons in the most gruesome way possible."
1716,Nygle497,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"The Best Arena FPS game. Demons are cool, but killing them is much more cooler."

1718,Jerry309,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"Pretty cool, definitely not a wind down game tho. If you're gonna play this get ready to tryhard to defeat all 100 demons in every room. glory kills are awesome tho"
1719,Nicholson70,"Apr 13, 2021",10,Last time that I played this franchise it was the original doom back in the mid 90's. This is mind blowing in comparison!!!
1720,Rtpkd1,"Apr 13, 2021",10,In short - the best dynamic shooter with unstoppable gameplay ((It's like a Mortal Combat in Shooter genre))!Doom:Eternal is definitely more worthy buy than other products from this franchise.
1721,SleepyAdam1083,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"I hear a lot of people call Doom Eternal inflexible, and I don't think that's very fair or accurate, how flexible it is really depends on your pride and your ability to utilize the options that are laid out before you. The first time I played through Doom Eternal, I picked Ultra Violence because I thought ""yeah I've played Doom before and that's the best Doom difficulty"". I also turned off tutorials because from a YouTube review I heard they were frequent and annoying, and I had played so many id software games in the past I was confident in my ability to just pick it up and play it. I eventually turned the tutorials back on when I got my ass kicked by the Arachnotron for the 5th time without realizing the turret was a weak point. I didn't wanna miss out on any info like that again, and while I'd say my experience with the game was decently fun after that, I still felt like I was missing something, and like the game wasn't clicking with me. I liked the over the top story and bombastic level design that was much more dynamic and varied than Doom 2016, but in terms of combat I always felt like I was a few steps out of pace with Doom Eternal on my first playthrough. I think this is mostly due to the fact that the Ultra Violence difficulty is rather unforgiving, and that's not a bad thing, it's just rather demoralizing for beginners at the game who need to learn the mechanics. It's hard to learn those mechanics when you're constantly on edge and constantly at risk of dying due to the fact one wrong move can entirely throw you off, and considering Ultra Violence is most people's go to Doom difficulty I can see how so many people tried it and were instantly turned off, thinking there was something wrong with the game. Personally, my biggest problem was I found myself using a lot of the same abilities and weapons to do everything. Everytime I saw a weak point I'd use the heavy cannon scope and only the heavy cannon scope to take it out, never using the sticky bombs, heat blast, ballista, etc. I wouldn't use a lot of the new abilities like the blood punch, ice bombs, grenades, etc. It was too overwhelming to think about in the middle of the incredibly heated battles. The things is Doom Eternal is flexible enough to let you play it this way, you can beat it but it's not very fun to do so. But still, I managed to struggle through the game on my first playthrough, constantly on edge and never learning anything, by the time I beat it, I was glad I had but I didn't feel very accomplished. In fact I felt kind of demoralized. I leaned later that my greatest mistake was never lowering the difficulty and giving myself more room to breathe. When I finally played the game again a year later, I finally chose Hurt Me Plenty on the difficulty settings because my pride in playing that difficulty had definitely been shattered by that point and I just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore, wasn't like anyone could see me. The thing is Hurt Me Plenty in classic Doom was pitiful, there were way less enemies making levels feel rather empty which leads to it generally being shunned across all Doom game's by the community, but what a lot of people don't know is Hurt Me Plenty in Doom Eternal is just a normal difficulty in any other game, it's the exact same enemy count and placements, just with less damage output and a little bit less punishment for not reacting fast enough. When I finally chose HMP, I finally had that room to breathe and it allowed me to get more creative with my playstyle, and just like that the game finally clicked with me. I started using Doomguy's entire arsenal, and learned how to utilize Doom Eternal's mechanics in satisfying ways that made me feel smart for figuring them out, it fully immersed me in it's combat puzzle. When I came back to the Ultra Violence difficulty, despite playing on an easier difficulty earlier, I had learned enough from that more easygoing mode that I was finally good at the game, and I managed to beat it in one go in Extra Lives mode, and while it was no Ultra Nightmare playthrough, it's one of the most satisfying experiences I've had in a video game. So my recommendation to new players is turn that difficulty down, use those cheat codes, do anything that makes the experience more fun and easygoing and your playstyle will begin to show itself naturally, don't force yourself to go in hard due to pride, this is a very different game than any FPS out there and you just gotta have fun with it. When you do that and fully utilize the options it gives you to tweak the game to your experience, it's not only not inflexible, it's one of the most flexible and fun experiences you can have with an FPS game. id Software knocked it out of the park. As I type this I am currently playing through my first Nightmare playthrough and I can officially say I'm addicted now."
1722,KingAjaax48,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"Buy it. It looks kind of interesting, right? Seems like it would be super fun to run around and shoot demons. It is. It's damn near the most fun I've had in my life. Just play the game. You won't regret it."
1723,Fatbastard19,"Apr 13, 2021",10,"its freakin Doom. Its got story if you want story its super gory for all the glory, get it, and remember. R I PANDT E A R"
1724,Danzin390,"Apr 13, 2021",10,Doom is a fast FPS shooter where you can enjoy the feeling of killing demons. It will make your hart pump. Most of the time you are running from a hord of demons while shooting at others simultaneously. You have to learn all the weak points of the demons if you want to beat the levels on higher difficulty.
1725,Yugmangus13,"Apr 15, 2021",10,What else hasn't been said about this masterpiece? Go play if you like an intelligent smart action game.

1727,Harrymoris012,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal has to go right up there in the top 3. Literally nothing comes close in terms of the adrenaline and rush of these fights and this DLC notches it up to 11. Amazing job from ID, you guys absolutely killed it and have made, in my opinion, the most fun gaming experience possible. Do yourself a favour and download this!"
1728,Dovar9,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"Its DOOM its ETERNAL, its DOOM ETERNAL. Fantastic game like almost perfect. Its so good it kinda ruined other Shooters for me, playing DOOM Eternal and then Halo, CoD or even DOOM16 makes them feel boring. Every weapon feels punchy and has worth in combat, the combat itself is fast and gets the blood pumping. The violence is absolutely beautiful to watch and inflict upon the Demons, Chainsaw kills have been integrated as a way to get Ammo which also works really well. The music too is amazing, Mick Gordon did an amazing job and this is definetly his best work so far, which makes it incredibly sad to see him leave the DOOM franchise."

Featuring high octane game play, beautiful environments, tons of enemy variety, weapon variety, incredible music, etc. This is a premium gaming experience at it's core. This game is worth every penny due to the games replay ability."
1731,MikeCoxlong910,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"Well, after 100 hours of playtime and beating everything on Ultra-Nightmare, I can with confidence say that this is the best FPS I have ever played. The combat loop they started working on in 2016 has now been expanded upon and fully mastered, with every weapon and mod having some sort of use. Weak points, flame belch, ice bomb, grenades, blood punch, all the weapons and mods; it all combines into a chaotic whirlwind of enjoyment, especially when you actually get good at the game. That's not to mention the wide variety of demons, each with their own quirks that spice up the gameplay in their own way, and each having specific things to target in order to take them out faster, which further encourages getting even more in-depth with the game's systems. Even the platforming adds to the experience: teaching you how to better use movement during combat while at the same time giving you a nice break between arenas. This is a big change from 2016, where you simply walked between areas, taking an elevator here and there, and it's a change I greatly welcome."
1732,Goldwolf57,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"Jsem rád, že jsem hrál hru na Bethesda Launcheru, protože se zde nepíše playtime.

Objevil jsem nové mody - takže jsem si konečně mohl zahrát se skiny ze starších eventů, které jsem promeškal. Podobné nadšení jsem prožíval se Zombie Army 4 Dead War.

1734,Killjoys9,"Apr 15, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal what a great game, I played DOOM when it came out on floppy disc on a Dos computer. The game is fast play and great graphics. The down side of the game is you can't save the game unless you are at only certain parts of the game, if you want to stop the game will take you back to the last check point not where you stopped. You should save the game where you want stop and come back later and pick up right where you left off and not just at check points of the game."

I haven't even played another Doom game, but maybe it's because of how much time I've spent in other competitive shooters that a game like this is so enjoyable for me.

DOOM Eternal might feel punishing at first, but keep at it and you'll ascend to pure FPS bliss, constantly switching weapons on the fly to adapt to the situation, dashing, jumping, and grappling around the battlefield, and dishing out huge bursts of damage to blow demons to pieces. This game will demand effort from you, but even an FPS noob can get into the Fun Zone and feel the rush of ripping and tearing."

Very very very rarely drop frames outside of Super Gore Nest even with most settings on Ultra-Nightmare and in the year and a bit that I've been playing it on and off its never crashed on me. If you like fast shooters that aren't afraid to kick your ass sometimes then DOOM Eternal is about as good as it gets."

1760,Movieman492,"Apr 16, 2021",10,"Eternal is gold. It takes the best parts of 2016, amps all of it up, and tosses in various new mechanics resulting in a game that is so exhilarating, fast paced, and gruesome that you just can't look away. All of the controls are tight, the game runs well, that incredible soundtrack is back... I struggle to find anything to take issue with. After a decent learning curve, de-programming previous DOOM muscle memory and play styles, you get into such a flow of ripping and tearing. It's satisfying and thrilling. I can't recommend it enough. If you're on the fence, just go for it. Give it a chance. And enjoy."

All enemies and weapons are very well designed and fits into the combat loop nicely. You need to have good situational awareness and plan your attack within a few seconds of entering an arena, and good ammo management is very important or else you will be running out of ammo a lot. One really big improvement from DOOM-2016 is falling off an edge no longer instantly kills you, it just removes a bit of your health so it makes the parkour much more enjoyable."
1775,Mankey41,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"Brilliant, fast paced and pure FPS. I have been playing doom since around 1996. I play through Ultimate and Doom 2 yearly and this game easily scratches the same itch."
1776,Squab_nz745,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"The best way I could describe this game is that it is pure testosterone fueled mayhem. The music is great, the gameplay is great, and the graphics are great. You actually start to feel sorry for the demons in the game as you rip and tear your way through everything. 10/10 would play again."
1777,Manbehindbooty7,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"This game slaps ass. Seriously, if you want to have a fun time, buy it. Much better than Doom 2016 and that game was also amazing."
1778,Grom215,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"One of the greatest games ever made, no questions asked. Best game in series."
1779,Strgezer157,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"There is absolutely nothing like this game. Absolutely a 10/10 and a candidate for game of the year. The gameplay is absolutely flawless, and it makes you feel incredible as you move through perfectly made maps at superhuman speeds with powerful and unique weapons. Nothing can describe the satisfaction you get when you chainsaw a demonic soldier in half, rip out a Cacodemons eyeball and watch it explode, or grab an imp by the eye sockets and tear it in half with your bare hands. You can play this game for hours and only scratch the surface of the amount of glory kills and unique gore you can see. And you do it all while feeling completely in control of the fight as the Doom Slayer, an unbelievably powerful demigod with incredibly efficient demon-killing abilities. If you haven’t bought this game or played it, do it now. I promise you it is 100% worth it."
1780,BaYoneTTa52,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"So as someone who absolutely loves Shooters and especially Competitive ones that challenge you to be fully focused and improve in what you are doing... this Game is just for you!Are you tired and sick of having to rely on teammates in Competitive Shooters to get the most out of your fun?Then play this game, you will have the same Level of Challenge but you rely on nobody but yourself. As for the Music of this Game, one could say you buy an album and the Game comes as a Bonus! Story could be argued about, but it is all a matter of preference, to me it is a sweet addition to a Game that does not even need a Story. What can i say, just buy this Game, you will not regret it! My Personal Game of the Century, i have never enjoyed a Game this much!"
1781,Bluewind17,"Apr 17, 2021",10,"Worthy sequel to Doom 2016. Improves on just about everything that made the first game great, but the added complexity causes some issues. There is a bit of a disconnect between the speed of the game and how many options you have at any given point, especially as the game progresses. You have so many tools at your disposal, and so many resources to manage that it can slow you down. This can hurt the flow of the game play, but it's still a blast to play if you can get in the groove. None of these issues are major problems, as the core of the game, the moment to moment gun play and the level exploration, are superb. Overall a fantastic game, one of the best FPS games to come out in a long time, highly recommended."
1782,Reist2009,"Apr 18, 2021",10,Perfect in every way. Best way to let off steam after a bad day. Would recommend.
1783,Tinymann15,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"A family friendly game, contains killing demons which means its for christians! Very good."
1784,Jrtingson85,"Apr 18, 2021",10,Holy hell what a game. Adrenaline-pumping action! Takes a lot of skill too so deep.
1785,FainOnFire55,"Apr 18, 2021",10,The base game is worth full price. It improves upon the 2016 installment in every fashion.
1786,Ichaukan2801,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"It has this built in ""Classic Doom"" rendering mode that looks uncannily good."
1787,BasedJabroni899,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Don't bother with the weird gimmicky DLC's, just play this and enjoy unsullied FPS perfection."
1788,MarkoPolo6,"Apr 18, 2021",10,There is no ammo in this game morons say. Me say chainsaw go Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrm.
1789,Svjergard39,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Freaking amazing. Just buy it, it's Doom and it's awesome. The negative reviews on this site are total nonsense ignore them."
1790,Kiflion7,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Mon jeu préféré de tous les temps. Le logiciel d'identification s'est vraiment surpassé avec celui-ci. un jeu fluide, des armes incroyables, une IA stimulante qui vous oblige vraiment à penser en dehors de votre zone de confort d'une manière qui vous aide vraiment à devenir un meilleur joueur et à son tour permet une créativité et un plaisir qui sont des LIGUES par rapport aux autres jeux. tant que vous êtes prêt à lui donner une chance. la bande originale du jeu de base et du DLC est une classe de maître. alors que le jeu n'est pas parfait et qu'aucun jeu ne l'est."
1791,Prepotent669,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Очень весело, хорошая механика, хорошая графика, хороший сюжет. В целом игра хорошая."
1792,Misery14,"Apr 18, 2021",10,Nothing beats the lightning bolt action of this game. I never knew a game could do this lol.
1793,Nogamenofame340,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Very intensive game play and very gory, I would suggest to any fast pace, octane action fps lover."
1794,Big_nips18,"Apr 18, 2021",10,So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good only downside is that its not long enough!!! Can't wait to play the master levels.
1795,Budala13682,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Dobra stara Propast. Ne možete pogriješiti s ovom igrom ako ste za izazov. Igra prekrasnog izgleda, s puno krvavih i nevjerojatnim soundtrackom. Jednostavno jedan od mojih najdražih strijelaca u posljednje vrijeme, i dobro mjesto za ispuštanje u lošem danu."
1796,Gozer104,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Helemaal weg van het spel, zou het ten zeerste aanbevelen voor spelers die van een snel spel houden."
1797,Jippyjang75,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"After 5 years of not playing a single game, Doom Eternal got me back into gaming. What a game."
1798,Copypasta75259,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Freaking sick game. It would be like if a game had Doom 2 art style but gameplay wise a mix with Metroid Prime 2, Quake, Unreal Tournament and Devil May Cry. Masterpiece of an action game."
1799,Camilojarapac31,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Great game. It has elements from all time classics, from Mortal Kombat to MegamanX. It's a celebration to gaming."
1800,Lexten8080,"Apr 18, 2021",10,Love the game. Underrated aspect is the sound effects. The popping sound made when making a head shot is oddly satisfying.
1801,MrCo0kieCar4,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Great graphics and story, I like the mini events you can earn items from pretty cool."
1802,Sendhelpnowpl93,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"Doom eternal takes everything from doom (2016) and expands on it and makes it better the music weapons story are all so good and it has a lot more to do than doom (2016) like exploration,challenges (like slayer gates)."
1803,Drsinbad1834,"Apr 18, 2021",10,"The gold standard for fast-paced action FPS. Every weapon, mod, equipment piece, and ability has some key purpose in the combat loop. Once you learn the way the game wants you to play, you can get creative with your own play-style within that. The game really shines for me on the higher difficulties, my personal favorite being Nightmare. The base campaign will really test your ability to understand and overcome difficult encounters, the definition of ""hard but fair"". I don't have much to say that others haven't said, but for me this game has became an all-timer for me. I've been gaming since the NES era, and I'm glad to see a AAA developer in this era making a game of uncompromising quality."
1804,Ausmo635924,"Apr 18, 2021",10,Like Doom 2016 this is one of the best FPS game's I've ever played. Really loved the improvements to movement and combat.
1805,BasedJune2,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Awesome game all around. Slaying demons is intense and fun. Very deep gameplay.
1806,Saurabh2490,"Apr 19, 2021",10,When the music starts...all u want to do is....rip and tear. Flawless performance on my PC. A game well made. Hell yea i'd recommend this game.
1807,Esotericnormie9,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Amazing game. Amazing combat. Would have liked the if the spirits would were vulnerable to other guns.
1808,Urbancrusader82,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"Intense action where every battle is also a bit of a puzzle? Doom Eternal is great, absolutely. It's faster better and harder than Doom 2016. It is also lot more difficult. I consider myself good at shooters, but this one is devilishly hard and I have no idea how anyone could beat this at nightmare or even the 2nd highest difficulty. The new enemies are interesting, the Marauder though ... yeah, I can see why people hate him but I love him."
1809,Bigstonks11,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Absolutely phenomenal if you like FPS or if you even THINK about FPS games then play doom eternal right now!
1810,Creampuff24,"Apr 19, 2021",10,i haven't had this much fun in years if you can buy this game do it also if you can get it.
1811,Nullniche943,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"Great tight gameplay. You gotta learn what the game wants to teach you. After you learn all that, you'll be amazed at the stuff you can pull off."
1812,Redkoolaidman5,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Doom Eternal and The Ancient Gods might be the best single player FPS I've ever played. It is a cross between classic Quake/Quake 3 deathmatch and Bayonetta/Devil May Cry.
1813,Claydavis92,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"This is the best FPS I have ever played. After playing this everything else feels slow, frustrating, and not adrenaline pounding enough. I would recommend this game to anyone. This is absolutely my favorite game. ID out did themselves."
1814,Libertyprime340,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"If you like 'classic' FPS's, this is one of the best modern recreations of the feel and energy of those games while taking advantage of modern styles and technology."
1815,Proboofer719,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Fantastic game. A little disappointed there isn't an achievement for completing campaign on a harder difficulty. Guess I wasted some time and frustration on a higher difficulty that didn't have a payoff. Oh well.
1816,Lopez401,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Asombroso juego. Pura adrenalina la secuela con un juego bien diseñado. Me gusta mucho. Increíble.
1817,Platosdumbson3,"Apr 19, 2021",10,This game is like 2016 on amped to the heavens. Its hard to go back with the all the the improvements.
1818,Civiefanboi11,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"Amazing game, but make sure you master the combat and play in the normal difficulty your first time around, it isn't easy."
1819,Pollo168,"Apr 19, 2021",10,I recommend people buy this game. Games awesome. Thats all I can say almost perfect.
1820,Citizensnip26,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Best game i ever played. I love it ! Playing campaign second time. I might play ultranightmare in my next run.
1821,Jokergang4,"Apr 19, 2021",10,This game is pure fun and skill. It is also arguably the one greatest shooters ever made.
1822,Spyro6785,"Apr 19, 2021",10,"Hugo Martin must be out of his mind for letting me, a mere mortal, possess so... much... POWER at my little fingers. Yeah i liked the game a lot i have a lot of hours into it gg."
1823,Spodermansux371,"Apr 19, 2021",10,The only game that gave me carpal tunnel...Seems like a game for sweaty juicers like myself.
1824,Benderbot201,"Apr 19, 2021",10,The complexities of combat makes this a super fun game worth sinking hundreds of hours into. it's very rewarding to master all of the weapons and how to fight all types of demons strategically.
1825,T5tashad,"Apr 19, 2021",10,يا لها من لعبة مجنونة. لعبة رائعة رائعة. عليك أن تتعلم ميكانيكا اللعبة وإلا ستموت. هذه اللعبة هي تحفة فنية.
1826,Lee2021search,"Apr 19, 2021",10,F the nostalgia. I will proudly admit this game makes all other Doom games into slow paced children games.
1827,Hajduk_split44,"Apr 19, 2021",10,Ovo mi je postala jedna od najdražih doom igara zajedno s doom classic. Igranje je poput Unreal-Tournament-a i Metroida.
1828,Its3monketime,"Apr 20, 2021",10,i like the one where he shoots the demon :D. Jokes aside really enjoyable game.
1829,Bengali40,"Apr 20, 2021",10,Most innovative FPS since Halo and the original COD. Hopefully this masterpiece inspires a new generation for the genre.
1830,Quakenerd923,"Apr 20, 2021",10,One of best game in 2021. super cool action packed FPS game 10/10 would play forever.
1831,Quackmode35,"Apr 20, 2021",10,This is a game were you can literally hook on to a demon and shove shotgun up their ass.
1832,Themadduck54,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"Very addictive gameplay! If you struggle, take your time at lower difficulty until you get into the rhythm! Have fun!"
1833,Hmmpbrother5,"Apr 20, 2021",10,Sick game but I am sorry the full auto attachment of the shotgun is balls. Sorry Under The Mayo and full auto gang.
1834,Shevronshiller6,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"Truly the renaissance of a franchise. DOOM 2016 was the beginning, but DOOM Eternal sealed the success of the franchise with fast paced gameplay, quick reflex learning, great graphics... As a FPS gamer I had to relearn how to move, shoot and control the arena. Also the difficulty gives you a solid challenge for veteran gamers (aside from part 1... My god...). Overall Must have for FPS gamers out there !!"
1835,Foxboxtox5844,"Apr 20, 2021",10,I wasn't a fan of the previous Doom game but this one is surprised me how fun it was.
1836,420Swagman,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"As I'm reaching 300 hrs played after a year with the game, I think I can comfortably say this is my favorite game of all time. Everything is this game is so finely tuned to give you the best FPS experience you've ever had. The movement is this game is phenomenal and advanced movement tech makes you really feel like an unstoppable being for pure DOOM. Game also has a great community with some awesome content creators."
1837,Chaffer64,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"Okay this game is a masterpiece! Level variety on point, graphics are amazing, game runs smooth and gameplay is almost perfect."
1838,Plebecrusher303,"Apr 20, 2021",10,I love this game. Just one to gush about this. Shooting demons in the game is soo fun. The ping sound of popping weak points is soo satisfying :)
1839,Tidepodeater152,"Apr 20, 2021",10,Yes i recommend this game its fun and it makes you feel like a god and its hard.
1840,711Parttimejob,"Apr 20, 2021",10,A really fast action shooter game and is really fun overall. Movement is really fast and fun.
1841,Thetanator2151,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"These addons for DOOM are HARD AF! Definitely play the first campaign on harder levels before even attempting this! If you are up for a challenge, though... this right here is LEGIT. It's very fast paced and will get you holding your breath at tense moments and your heart rate up. I can't even play this game unless I am well rested! Definitely worth it across the board."
1842,Luckduck59,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"One of the best game I have ever played. The combat is skill based and satisfying, and the flow of the combat is incredibly good. DOOM Eternal is a refreshing break from all the modern fps games that are all just more of the same. The music is fantastic and easily the best of any game I've ever played. I would recommend DOOM Eternal to anyone who plays video games, and even some people that don't."
1843,Luciddreamer8,"Apr 20, 2021",10,The thing i love most about this game is everything. The best installation of DOOM since DOOM II.
1844,Lipp_Sticc76,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"This game reprogrammed my brain to the point where I can no longer play any shooter that expects me to stand still for more than five seconds. There is so much verticality, so much polish, so much fun with the game in the GAME. This game is a masterpiece, end of discussion."
1845,Destimoney19,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"I am really impressed by how good this game is. It is worth of all the praised its received, and they have a killer formula to move forward with. The battles are intense and exciting; I was constantly on the edge of my seat. Even better than Doom 2016, which I thought was great at the time."
1846,Nero60,"Apr 20, 2021",10,"The best shooter I've played. Ever. While Doom (2016) made you feel unstoppable, Eternal made you work for it. Mastering Eternal is an experience like no other. The level design is fantastic, the gunplay is even better, and the new challenges you get make it all the more satisfying when you beat the final boss. The difficulty is much higher in this game, as you have much less ammo, enemies hit you like a truck, and there are a lot of new enemies to keep track of. If you're new to Doom/Shooters in general, I recommend setting the difficulty on Hurt Me Plenty. (I beat it on Nightmare on my first playthrough cuz I'm just that good) The Movement is a gift from god. You got double jump instantly, dashes, climbing, swinging on monke bars, the Meat-Hook, ect. It feels so good to zip through the map while blasting demons to dust. The only thing I can criticize is that the final boss's first phase is kinda annoying, and that's about it. The game reviews who said this game wasn't as good as 2016 just didn't care enough to try and get better. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and will continue playing in the future. There is so much to this game that makes it great that I haven't even talked about. Just get the game 11/10"
1847,Turnstyling559,"Apr 20, 2021",10,Damn good game. I'll be playing through it again. The soundtrack is perfect. Fast paced and non-stop action.
1848,Dopaminefiend39,"Apr 20, 2021",10,John Wick but it's demons that killed his bunny. Cutting the heads off evil cultist priests.
1849,Spiteful57,"Apr 21, 2021",10,What can I say about this crazy game lol. Never played a game soo fasted paced.
1850,Bobtopolis6,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"I ripped and tore, until it was done. Lots of fun, some parts were a little too much but I had a good time all around."
1851,Madhouse80,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"This game is like, as the title says, eternal. whenever I feel stressed I come right back to this game to work the stress off. 10/10 recommend."
1852,Leeta9,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Crank the music volume up and enjoy the one of the best FPS of the decade. Hell yea.
1853,HombreFuerte38,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Un juego cristiano increíble para toda la familia. Mata a los demonios del infierno. Desterrarlos.
1854,Magiumpi7,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Do you like First person shooters? YES? Then wtf are you waiting for! Get this amazing game!
1855,Swazzy610,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"This game definitely gives the Doom series a flair of its own - the light resource management combined with the relatively demanding gameplay distinguish Doom Eternal from other shooters in the market. The gameplay is crisp, and the engine is very well optimized. ID really is trying to set a new bar for smooth FPS gameplay and it shows."
1856,Friendzoner125,"Apr 21, 2021",10,The combat loop is so good and when you master the quick swapping it is so rewarding but if you do not like quick swapping there is other alternatives also.
1857,Sicario999,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"Best FPS to come out in recent years. The story/lore is quite good too, and completely optional if you'd like to just kill demons. 10/10"
1858,Jay2shekels,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Love this game. Great if you like Doom. Game 10/10 would and tear again and again.
1859,Snowball761,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"The game is one of the most polished titles I have in my game library. It just works so well, incredibly optimized and has lots for you to customize (the HUD for me). Last year on my first play-through I was a bit disappointed, I had too much hype! Playing through again with an open mind it really is a fun game that plays amazing. I paid full price when it came out but now the game already goes to 50% discount often and that is completely worth the price to play if you are on the fence. The story is wack in a good way, just enjoy all the pretty colors and intense action!"
1860,Anescapegoat428,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"They turned a mindless shooter into something that requires brain power. Every weapon has a purpose and every enemy has a weakness. No clue how they are going to top this one. But they already topped Doom 2016, so you never know... This is some of Ids best work."
1861,Bigmangaming100,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Imagine a big man jacked man in green armor suit jumping around like a monkey slaughtering demons. 100/100.
1862,RollingChair30,"Apr 21, 2021",10,One of the best FPS games of our time. Best hell simulator 10/10. Epic soundtrack and graphics.
1863,Samaslim2,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"Well what can I say what have not been said its gore, action and metal filled masterpiece with one of the greatest soundtracks in the world and the best gun play ever 100%"
1864,Attacktongoue73,"Apr 21, 2021",10,Can't think of anything funny to review it with but its good and very fun. Not else to add.
1865,PeakyPaprika918,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"This game will punish you for your mistakes, especially in the higher difficulties, but it's AMAZING to master. Once you're in the zone, quick cycling weapons, chainsawing minions and ripping and tearing everything in your way it provides and experience unlike any other. Recently been replaying it, and falling ABSOLUTELY in love with it all over again. It's fun to play, a bit complicated and hard to learn but with an awesome payoff and the music is one of THE BEST game soundtracks you'll ever get the pleasure to listen to. I'll definitely be buying the dlc for it in order to keep on slaying demons!"
1866,4HeadPoggers,"Apr 21, 2021",10,So I strained my neck from excessive headbanging. Perfect game would recommend.
1867,Hugemangus49,"Apr 21, 2021",10,In short extremely fun and well made game that is still getting improvements from patches and new content.
1868,Plugwalk11,"Apr 21, 2021",10,"The real meat and potatoes of the game. All missions are great, combat is immaculate and very skill based. The difficulty increase since DOOM 2016 is a big one, but it's doable. As another reviewer once said, it's a fast-paced blood-fueled game of chess. You will constantly need to monitor your health, armor and ammo. Very rewarding combat, spectacular arena design, and superb graphics. 10/10"
1869,Astroia27,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Very good, possibly my favorite game of this generation. Nothin else to talk about its that good."
1870,Sabertooth75,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Best singleplayer fps shooter currently out there, truly epic game. Battlemode while kind of cool is barebones."
1871,Ripass89,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Rip and Tear until you are done (which is never, btw). You will never stop ripping demons apart."
1872,Thionic621,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Tbh the reviews say it best, it's a ballet performed with bullets, and an amazing one at that."
1873,Largestiffy546,"Apr 22, 2021",10,Amazing. i have played this over and over and still love it. Best game released from 2020.
1874,Danteinferno666,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Rip, and tear, until it is done my friends. Very fun and enjoyable, I have had issues trying to stop playing once I get started. The game is very very created and can be challenging for new people, recommended to start on nightmare on your first run to get the full game play experience."
1875,Crickrock3,"Apr 22, 2021",10,Would recommend 100% man. What a game. Extremely enjoyable experience from start to finish.
1876,Analatetor922,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"When you're tired of complicated story and deep lore, come to DOOM. Just RIP AND TEAR."
1877,SamuraiSlayer98,"Apr 22, 2021",9,"Fun game. Story is decent, combat is amazing and the soundtrack is bomb. The game has bugs here and there, and the multiplayer lacks players. Overall good game."
1878,Scaredzed6,"Apr 22, 2021",10,Game is obviously amazing go get it lol. Carcass was the greatest troll invention of all time.
1879,Ostar498,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Fantastična igra, zabavna i ugodna. Igra je vrlo kreativna i može predstavljati izazov za nove ljude."
1880,Pipe24luxurious,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"This game will give you a real first person shooter, it is very intense so be prepared. If you play this game on nightmare it will make you want to beat it and that's a GUARANTEE."
1881,VonStark50,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Good old fashioned Doom fun. Become the doomslayer, mess up every single demon that comes your way."
1882,Correctamused12,"Apr 22, 2021",10,This game is amazing. it took everything that worked with doom 2016 and added a sick grappling hook.
1883,Unlawful88,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"The game slaps, music slaps, graphics slaps, level slaps, movement slaps and lore slaps."
1884,Moisty3,"Apr 22, 2021",10,Amazing game. Does not care about your playstyle and instead you have to adapt to it in order to have fun with it at the higher levels while still being very accessible to more casual players.
1885,Jesus90,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"This is hands down the best game I have ever played. I have no complaints. I love fast paced, I love high precision fps GAMING, and I love deep combat systems to explore and grow on. I recommend this to anyone who is a hard fan of the FPS genre, and if you love faster paced games as well."
1886,Thumb_jolly78,"Apr 22, 2021",10,Absolutely loved every second of this insane joy ride of a murder fest this game is. I had a very hard time putting this game down when i started played. The music constantly keeps you in tune with every shot you fire. If you haven't played this game yet then something is definitely wrong with you.
1887,Brookz10,"Apr 22, 2021",10,"Challenging but fun game, tests reflexes and tests your skill. Fun to play, but not too easy, you can toy around with weapons, codes, Armour, almost everything, it feels fresh. So many challenges and fun things to do in this game, I really like it a lot. The story is amazing, the multiplayer is pretty good and the overall game play is just astonishing."
1888,1Andonly,"Apr 22, 2021",9,Fast paced and brutal. Everything you'd expect from DOOM but even more fast and CRAZY! RIP AND TEAR!
1889,DolphLOL,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"Animations, combos, details, gameplay, soundtrack but most of all God Tier Optimization. One of the best FPS games ever exist"
1890,Corci4borki,"Apr 23, 2021",10,Players of the 2016 DOOM will love this game. The gunplay is great and with a dash of story line as well.
1891,Poopmachine1364,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"One of the best FPS ever created. High skill ceiling. High replayability. Next step in the genre. Checkout @UnderTheMayo on youtube, amongst others, for becoming a badass demon slayer. You will probably be yawning while playing other (generic/mainstream) shooters after playing this. Worth every penny including the DLCs. Stop reading and buy this now!"
1892,Ians45,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal improves the combat system that was setup in Doom 2016 to a new level. Additions like Flame Belch, SSG Meathook, the Dash, Ice Bomb and other additions make this game a step up from Doom 2016. However the game itself is more challenging because it requires more skill from the player, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the player. Doom Eternal forces you to consider managing your resources for things like ammo, because weapon ammo capacity has been reduced from 2016. I personally think this is a good thing and I welcome the changes and the increase of difficulty. It requires me and other players to think about how they play the game. It helps keep the player engaged with the combat loop. I find the gameplay addicting and fun. I recommend old Doom players alike to try out this newest game in the franchise and new players to try out Doom 2016 first and then play Eternal."
1893,Tinnerfuk112,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"NOW THIS IS FAST PACED ACTION! The movement system feels finished and the weapons act in a complimentary manner that encourages combo attacks and accuracy. This game will FORCE you to play well through disincentivizeing using singular weapons and rewarding swapping weapons and using the right tool for the job. Use of every gadget available is also encouraged, giving much needed health, armor, and ammo. The lore is there, but its not neccessary to understand it to play the game."
1894,Supersnot5,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"Almost beat it and I can say its an amazing, challenging, and badass experience. Buy it!"
1895,Cokeisbetter711,"Apr 23, 2021",10,Dude this game is a master class. I love it soo much. Popping heads with scope is soo good.
1896,Whipstall708,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"its doom eternal, what am i suposed to say? its just... perfect. Tomato spin."
1897,Purple_ramen496,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"It's a cool game.. it keeps changing, lots of upgrades and customization; without being too much. It eases you in to the all your skills bit at a time. Lots of unlocks. And also fun and action packed."
1898,JoltikThePoke66,"Apr 23, 2021",10,So a bought $50 for a banger soundtrack. There is also a free game included which is cool.
1899,10ObfusYaff,"Apr 23, 2021",10,My will to live is temporary but doom is eternal. Worth to buy and pretty baller game.
1900,Antonisvaik1,"Apr 23, 2021",10,If you look at this game just for its single player gameplay its just 10/10 lmao best shooter ever no cap combat is leagues above anything else on the planet.
1901,Shamrock269,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"Action packed and Metal. You've heard of the boomer shooter, prepare for the Doomer Shooter."
1902,OzamSaggar2073,"Apr 23, 2021",10,"Just played it for the first time, haven't stopped for 3 days, I see the demons when I close my eyes."
1903,Pumpytoddy57,"Apr 23, 2021",10,The DOOM goes boom. A fun and complicated arena shooter. Love the UI options.
1904,WraithofKhan94,"Apr 23, 2021",10,Awesome game definitely recommended if your a fan of FPS games this is a must buy.
1905,Peep3378,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Battlemode matchmaking is super jank. The rest of the game is a masterpiece of gameplay.
1906,Lucky_Snips27,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"10 out of 10, hard mode actually hard. I think a wasted all of my adrenaline playing this."
1907,Masterofcrusa40,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Think of it as playing Halo.but... Everything around you burns.Your enemies burn.Your weapons burn.You burn. You're on speed the whole time and try to play Through fire and Flames on an out of tune Broomstick. I can't drink coffee anymore as I'm shaking all the time.
1908,Hubbard654,"Apr 25, 2021",10,This game is absurdly good. I only played on Nightmare mode (the most challenging) and it was frustrating at first but when you learn the rhythm of combat and unlock the full arsenal this a a true masterclass in First-Person-Shooters. Never have I felt like such a God in game while also having my heart race. Cannot recommend this enough. Play on easy difficulties for some mindless fun or harder difficulties to challenge yourself and experience the game the way it is meant to be played. The platforming is a welcome addition and the Devs clearly use it to show off their incredible level design and the beautiful graphics. Rip and tear baby!
1909,Flydown71,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"DOOM Eternal is a good game. In fact, a great game, absolutely incredible! Wow!"
1910,Queue99,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"Un crime absolu qu'il n'a pas gagné en prix réels. C'est la première fois depuis Super Mario 64 qu'un jeu me semble parfait Le gameplay est difficile car c'est l'enfer sur Terre. Pourtant, bien qu'il s'agisse d'un Exultia d'une tâche dans laquelle de nombreux développeurs ont échoué, le combat des cultistes de Doom (Hunter Base) Eternal est toujours un Super Gore Nest amusant. L'histoire est étonnamment complexe (ARC) dans son noyau (Mars) sans jamais s'éloigner de vos désirs (Sentinel) Prime pour tuer les démons L'atmosphère dans des endroits comme Taras Nabad ou Nekravol est époustouflante, en grande partie grâce aux excellentes compositions de Mick Gordon . avec des chansons comme Meathook, The Betrayer, Cultist Base, Super Gore Nest, The Only Thing They Fear Is You, Gladiator, Urdak et plus t devrait être un péché (final) pour qu'un jeu soit aussi parfait."
1911,Spicy8Saucer,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Doom is one of the best games to let my pain out and actually makes me feel like my dad's belt isn't that bad
1912,Mortallystupid2,"Apr 25, 2021",10,DOOM Eternal is perhaps the best game. The best first person shooter game. Rip and tear.
1913,Blogovic170,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"Incredibly fun and huge replay value when it comes to figuring out new moves, combos, and other mechanics. Enjoyed the movement mechanics and the huge trial and error moments I faced during the game. You can't just go in making dumb decisions, you have to mentally plan it out and know what you're doing and execute it well. Very enjoyable!"
1914,Zombieman109,"Apr 25, 2021",10,I would recommend doom eternal but in my opinion it isnt hectic enough. Jokes aside one of the greatest's FPS of all time.
1915,Zaatur97777,"Apr 25, 2021",10,The biggest improvement on the single player fps since the original doom. This game is great.
1916,Luegeur4,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"Definitely good for taking your anger out on. If you have a little prick who bullies everyone and you can't do anything about it, just pretend he's a hell knight and squish him."
1917,Chessmaster5,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"In terms of game play loops, this is the best single person shooter I have ever played. There's just something about riding a flaming meat hook toward a demon to brush their teeth with a double-barrel shotgun that makes me come back for more. If you like shooters at all, this game is a must."
1918,Heyjoey78,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Doom Eternal reminds me that games can be fun again which is awesome. Make games fun again.
1919,Skullhacker24,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Different than DOOM 2016. A good different but better. Addicting even. Must kill them ALL.
1920,Bigchangus1478,"Apr 25, 2021",10,By far the best modern FPS. The culmination of 30~ years of FPS experience condensed into this package right here.
1921,Lordoftheflies3,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Literally the best game I've ever played. the combat is so smooth like the guns and the movement work together to form some of the best combat ever crafted.
1922,Joseph1610,"Apr 25, 2021",10,Arguably the best game mechanics of all time. 10/10. Very rarely a few bugs pop up which is annoying on UN. Other than that Hugo is dad.
1923,Jumper_man035,"Apr 25, 2021",10,A triumphant reminder of what the FPS genre was and could be. 10 out of 10.
1924,Cannon500,"Apr 25, 2021",10,"The gameplay is fast, requires you to be aggressive and to use all the tools the game gives you to survive. I was afraid that all the new weapons and gadgets would make the game too easy when compared to Doom 2016 but that is not the case. This game is obscene amounts of fun."
1925,RomulKing,"Apr 26, 2021",4,"Прошел всю игру, но вот относительно ожиданий и относительно Doom (2016) больше все-таки разочарован. Да, графика шикарная, да, хорошая оптимизация/fps, но:1. Страшно переборщили с впихиванием похоже всех механик, которые только придумали - в итоге вместо шутера получается какая-то real-time стреляющая стратега с постоянным задействованием кучи не стреляющих/отвлекающих механик - добывание боеприпасов бензопилой, здоровья рукопашной, брони огнем, и т.п. + все это надо постоянно помнить и использовать (может кроме брони)2. Очень аркадное изображения всего - цветастые боеприпасы, мигающие разноцветными огнями монстры - вообщем какой-то супер марио, а не брутальный Doom3. Перебор с платформер-механиками - просто как кузнечик прыгаешь пол игры. Опять просто супер-марио, а не Doom.4. Бои - месиво, на экране каша - очень много монстров со всех сторон, в итоге все время бегаешь как сумасшедший. Не сконцентрироваться нормально на каком-то поединке хотя бы даже с группой монстров, все равно сзади кто-нибудь по мелкому или крупному мочит - уровни специально так сделаны как мультиплейерные.5. Еще раз - для шутера - переборщили со всем, что мешает наслаждаться боем - лутом боеприпасов, и здоровья (отвлекающим от боя), платформер прыжками, аркадным оформлением, кашей на экране от количества монстров и т.п.В итоге дополнение Ancient Gods покупать не буду."
1926,VariaLad,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"Holy **** ****. What a good ******* game. DOOM Eternal has the best gameplay of any game I've played. This game deserves so much more than an 8.7 score. Eternal is without a doubt in my mind, the best fps ever made. There is so much depth to the combat its utterly unbelievable. Play this goddamn game."
1927,Robaa33,"Apr 26, 2021",10,Anything I could say here has already been said about this game. Just try it.
1928,Fector665,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"It's amazing, best 60 dollars I ever spent on a game. The soundtrack is amazing, The combat and mechanics can be combined to do some cool while making you look like a god."
1929,Glombing4,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal es como un viaje emocionante del que nunca querrás irte.¿Por qué los jugadores pasan cientos de horas en un FPS de campaña para un jugador de 15 a 20 horas? Bueno, es divertido y nunca se vuelve rancio. Hay muchos juegos buenos que después de terminar la campaña principal, no hay mucho a lo que volver ... seguro que puedes jugar ese juego en un año para que se sienta fresco nuevamente, pero a menudo puede desencadenar eso. sentirse aburrido que puede hacer que deje de fumar y busque otra cosa que hacer. Doom Eternal nunca te hace sentir aburrido o desinteresado,"
1930,Sir205Vinty,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"This is a truly awesome game. I wasn't even that invested in DOOM when I first pre-ordered it (mainly just wanted the revenant doot skin), but playing this game made me a believer. The gunplay, the fast pace action, the platforming, the soundtrack, how the gore and violence actually has a method and use behind them (finisher = health + blood punch, chainsaw = more ammo, flamethrower = more armor) and the soundtrack behind it all constantly fueling and invigorating the player through their ripping and tearing. And even after the main story, you still have the amazingly unique multiplayer and DLC to dig into."
1931,SunneTheBeast72,"Apr 26, 2021",10,Pure enjoyment! No politics! NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Just slay some fing demons :D LOVE IT!
1932,Kojivrag199,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"Prvo, ova igra ne nudi mnogo istraživanja, poput ostalih velikih igara otvorenog svijeta. Sve su to linearne razine sa skrivenim tajnama. Postoji priča, ali mislim da Doom Slayer ne zna koja je priča ili da je zapravo čak i briga. Ova igra samo nudi neprekidnu akciju koja vas drži angažiranim u svakom trenutku. Većinu igre zadržava na tom slatkom mjestu zabave, uz male pauze kako se ne biste umarali. Vaše prvo igranje na Hurt Me Plenty bit će teško ako ste novi u Doomu. Umro sam nekoliko puta i gotovo odustao dok nisam pročitao jedan od savjeta na zaslonu za učitavanje ""Nastavi se kretati"". Shvatio sam da sam krivo igrao igru ​​... ovo nije pucačina u patke i pokrivače. Jednom kad sam to shvatio, zabavljao sam se trčeći, skačući i gađajući sve što se kretalo. Tada sam probao Nightmare nakon što sam prošao kampanju o ultra nasilju i počeo se zabavljati više nego ikad prije. Uspio sam se koristiti puškom za pušku super sačmarice kako bih se njihao, minirao svakog demona svim svojim oružjem (dodijelite svoje oružje vrućim tipkama za brzu zamjenu) i izlazio iz intenzivne borbe u areni osjećajući se uzbuđen zbog navale koju vam ova igra pruža. Demoni su nevjerojatni: naučit ćete sve njihove snage, slabosti itd. I počet ćete se uzbuđivati ​​kad se pojave najjači od njih. Oni će vas angažirati, a vi ćete ih željeti sve više i više."

1935,Vaxkids1531,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"How is this so addictive? Could it be the music, killing demons, a combination of both? I don't know but it is a great stress reliever and the highest difficulty while dying over and over again to endlessly combat spawn of hell... And then getting it right at last. Ufffff, the dopamine hit! Try this game. You won't regret it. Highly recommend."
1936,Tesla580,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"There are times when this game seems to difficult, but then I remember that I chose a higher difficulty, so it's exactly what I asked for.. a challenge. Likewise, when I want less challenge and more easy-going demon killing, reduced difficulty settings doesn't make me feel like a baby.It's a Doom game, you should know what it's all about.. you don't need to concern yourself with story or lore if you don't want to, which is nice.I love this game as a way to vent stress, even though there are time when it may become stressful, but it's almost cathartic in how methodically we can dispatch demons so well in this game."
1937,Nauryto1055,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"An amazing game, very fun and addictive. If u play 1 mission u wil lwant more and more and more. its really goood i loved the game so much!!!"

1940,CamionGrande5,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"La historia es excepcional. Cada aspecto del juego está muy detallado. El elenco de personajes es tan único. Toby Fox (el creador de Undertale) hizo un trabajo increíble al desarrollar una historia tan INTERESANTE y PROFUNDA, así como el juego en sí. Me hace preguntarme: ¿qué hará a continuación? Sea lo que sea, una secuela, un spin-off o un juego completamente diferente, lo comprobaré."

1947,slat3r,"Apr 27, 2021",10,A prime example of what video games are able to achieve. I was recommended by a friend to play this game and came out recommending it to many more. I came into it expecting it to be a mediocre game in a milked franchise but was instantly surprised by the polish and beauty of it. Do I recommend this game? YES!
1948,Travlance1,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"If you want a crazy fun, and adrenaline enducing, mission based game with an awesome variety of weapon and powerup combos It's absolutely worth it ESPECIALLY if it's on sale."

1952,Claybrun779,"Apr 27, 2021",10,Great fun. totally recommend getting this and playing it through. Nothing beats blasting demons to hell to make you feel good about yourself.
1953,Trockiz1001,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"I'm pretty bad at the game, so when I finally completed the game on Ultra Nightmare I fell out of my chair and practically broke my legs. 10/10 would break legs again"

1959,Zentucky864,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"(Written as a player that has completed hurt me plenty and playing nightmare) An amazing action packed thriller that makes you think how to do better when you die. In the beginning you will die. A lot. But that's ok. It is ok for games to be hard, and I love the design of this game having you on the edge of death. The chainsaw mechanic is super fun, if you are smart you can even flaming meathook to your enemy of choice for free armor when you go for ammo."
1960,Arbitor092,"Apr 27, 2021",10,I voted it the best game of the year and decade. Nothing else needs to be said.
1961,Commissioner7,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"As a die-hard DOOM fan, I have to say that this game gives me a MAJOR hard-on. Seriously, if you have ED, skip the little blue pill and play this. You won't regret it."

1963,Edgelord88,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"If this game makes its predecessor feel like child's play, then you know they've done something right. Doom Eternal combines combat, mobility, and defense in a way that not only improves on the previous, but creates a totally unique and 'easy to get into, but hard to master' gameplay loop. At no point is the slayer not given every tool he needs to rip and tear. If you're a Doom fan, then do yourself a favour and stop reading this review and start crushing some demon scum to pulp."
1964,Sergi415,"Apr 27, 2021",10,Great sequel and improved gameplay. Had lots of fun playing it. Amazing game.
1965,Shroom22,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"Might take a bit to get used to, with the bright ammo pickups, and the dying a lot, but as long as you're learning about what not to do then it gets amazing.The gameplay is fantastic; a bit tricky to start, but once you start to get the hang of it it all just flows.Music is perfect, it builds tension and rolls into dramatic action without being distracting. Not to mention it's practically spawned its own sub-genre because of how good it is.If you're a fan of fast-paced shooters - this is a must buy."
1966,Illuminati71853,"Apr 27, 2021",10,"Very Good game and better than DOOM 2016, DOOM Eternal feels like much more fast paced game Major amount of demons has a weak point which will enable you to use all weapons at your aresnal.

1967,Glassing206,"Apr 27, 2021",10,This game wouldn't disappoint you. I put in 100+ hours and still find this game super fun to play.

1987,Ragnorrock48,"Apr 28, 2021",10,"So much better than Doom 2016. Better pacing, better story, better graphics, better combat and more replayable."
1988,Wernyi39,"Apr 28, 2021",10,I finished this game just yesterday. After enjoying DOOM 2016(which i had some issues with) DOOM eternal was the perfect modern DOOM experience i was rooting for.
1989,Flight711,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Qué juego tan encantador. El mejor juego de la serie Doom. Mejor jugabilidad y gráficos.
1990,Powderkeg36,"Apr 29, 2021",10,This game is a stress reliever its like a cheaper version of a punching bag.
1991,Krombar434,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Groundbreaking OST! I later found it came with a full badass game. How cool.
1992,Cokenose812,"Apr 29, 2021",10,"Honestly why did you even need to read a review to buy this game, it is doom. So just buy it already."
1993,Godcomplex627,"Apr 29, 2021",10,i loved the game so much i sunk hundreds of hours into it just replaying the campaign again and again.
1994,Eddiebravo300,"Apr 29, 2021",10,This game is nothing but fun. Gameplay is pretty much perfect. Music is also amazing.
1995,Tvrdy_chlap1,"Apr 29, 2021",10,"No, buď jsem se za ta léta ve FPS hrách zhoršil, nebo evidentně někdo na id cítil, že doom hry nejsou dost náročné. Hraji na nejjednodušší obtížnost. Stále úžasná hra."
1996,Newport13,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Best FPS game at this moment. Only something like Ultrakill can compete with this monster.
1997,Charles66manson,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Nice graphics and it runs good. Fast paced arena shooter fun. Cool game. 9/10.
1998,Potatdor69,"Apr 29, 2021",10,"One of the most intense campaigns I've played through. This is not the power trip that DOOM 2016 was, it really is another beast entirely. My hand-eye coordination has never been better."
1999,Gumbo26,"Apr 29, 2021",9,Dont make me make reviews man. Good game. Demon killing. Stay moving. Unlock secret stuff. Blow stuff up. That's all youre gonna get.
2000,Sodie78,"Apr 29, 2021",10,"This game is amazing, it starts out moderately easy and turns more challenging with more difficult enemies to face."
2001,Kravtiz6,"Apr 29, 2021",10,An insanely fun experience that builds on the first game. Big improvement and masterful game.
2002,Ketamine92,"Apr 29, 2021",9,"Fast paced shooter with lots of cool enemies and weapons, reminds me of the original."
2003,Adultgambino44,"Apr 29, 2021",10,"Что касается визуальных эффектов и игрового процесса? Это чудесно красивый гладкий фестиваль крови с атмосферной, но легко читаемой обстановкой. Я чувствую, что часть этого теряется в том, насколько заметны пикапы и как оружие, ключи, секреты и пикапы знаний делают его таким «игривым» (я бы сказал, Аркадий, но ... я имею в виду ... судьба никогда не была готова ... игровые автоматы, правда ... ооо ... ага .: |) То, где они светятся и вращаются, парит над землей. О, боеприпасы и боеприпасы, вероятно, лежат на земле и все еще светятся, но с ними это немного более естественно. Хорошая игра."

2005,Markisadog2,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Fun amazing game with an interesting story. Love swinging on the monkey bars and dashing like a madlad. Runs well 8 year consoles as well.
2006,Rokendekerel15,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Dit is de mooiste boeiende shooter waarmee ik ooit het genoegen heb gehad mijn oogballen te zegenen.
2007,Monke8,"Apr 29, 2021",10,Fantastically designed game that weaves the player getting better in the mechanics.
2008,Synapse4dk,"Apr 29, 2021",10,I had an absolute blast with this game. It has kept me sane during this pandemic. Kudos id software.
2009,Libriform97,"Apr 30, 2021",10,I know this game is been praised to death but seriously great game all around. Never played a modern shooter since Titanfall with this level of good movement and combat.
2010,Cymometer2,"Apr 30, 2021",10,I had a semi-chub during the whole main campaign. Big stiffy man big one. This is a great game.
2011,Solomspd48,"Apr 30, 2021",9,"There was something about the aesthetic of DOOM 2016 that I makes me like it more. But otherwise, this game is objectively more mechanically sound. Its more Doom what's not to love?"
2012,Sprunlink422,"Apr 30, 2021",10,Best game of 2020 and probably the best fps shooter in the last 10 years. Yea its pretty good.
2013,Simnelco602,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"Doom 2016 blew my mind, this game is so good it makes 2016 look boring. Get it."
2014,Solar_Simnel9,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"Awesome game. Really intense, fast paced and difficult at the higher difficulty levels, but not unfairly so. The only barrier to success is your own skill. That's how it should be. I miss games like this that aren't all about stat buffs and numbers but just about raw mastery of the mechanics. I for one like the the platforming and exploration bits too, they serve as a nice break from the relentless slaughter-fests and an opportunity to catch your breath, reflect and appreciate the finer details of the level design."
2015,Carbasus152,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"This is with out a doubt one of my favorite games. amazing visuals, game play and balance. each fight feels tough but fair, it makes you feels like you deaths are your fault and not the game, and that's not something many games can pull off. i.e. This game really makes you FEEL like Doom Guy."
2016,Nephewsoft742,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"Its good. Funny game where you beat demon, die and then win. You get massive dopamine rush."
2017,CorneyZizel45,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"One of the best and funest games I've played. I'd recommend to anyone who wants some high-octane, old-fashioned, demon-slaying fun. Newbies or veterans, just pick your difficulty setting wisely..."
2018,Stej87_24,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"THIS GAME IS EPIC. Its hard, Its fun, Its fast paced and its gory. Best game I have played in a long time."
2019,SlaugtherHouse5,"Apr 30, 2021",10,I'm looking forward to put a crap ton of time into playing this game even tho I've finished the whole game it's still too addictive and engaging.. I just love it.
2020,Mithril29,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"I just finished playing through the whole Doom series for the first time ever and man, what a ride. Not only I'm a big Doom fan now, I think Doom is my favorite video game series now and Doom Eternal is one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best."
2021,Faire34,"Apr 30, 2021",10,"Le combat est si incroyablement bon, si satisfaisant. Au début, vous avez l'impression que c'est un peu écrasant lorsque le jeu ne cesse de vous lancer des outils à utiliser, mais quand vous vous y habituez, vous vous sentez comme un dieu."
2022,Spinotyrann77,"Apr 30, 2021",10,Would recommend to people who aren't sensitive to blood and like some spicy lore.

2026,Huskyy_JR4,"May  1, 2021",10,"Keeps you interested and makes you always want to play it, you also get a really good feeling when you finish a room. It is very intense and immersive which makes it just that step higher than most solo games."
2027,FaxDr3w,"May  1, 2021",10,"Very exciting, I'd give this 10! But if you like slower games, this isnt for you. You cant stop moving and its very difficult."
2028,Greberi65,"May  1, 2021",10,I beat this game in one sitting. I could literally snort bones right now man. Im gonna kill someone with the pure energy of toxic masculinity radiating from me.
2029,Chipdaassrip3,"May  1, 2021",10,Imagine a game were big super human muscular man rips off the anus of demons for fun. 0/10.
2030,Zatinas2802,"May  1, 2021",10,"If you haven't played that game, do it. It's an amazing sequel and it is fun to play"
2031,Vanitum266,"May  1, 2021",10,"This game is amazing. It integrates so many different elements into its game loop (resource management, split second decision making, reflexes, positioning, strategic planning) in such a wonderful way that makes the gameplay feel fluid, frenetic and adds weight to each and every move the player does."
2032,Obiteryer2100,"May  1, 2021",10,"Against all the Evil that Hell can conjure, all the Wickedness that Mankind can produce, we will unto them, only you. Rip, and tear, until it is done."
2033,Mrleon93,"May  1, 2021",10,Good fun rather than just jumpy like older games. somewhat brutal but oddly satisfying.
2034,Stuperocks65335,"May  1, 2021",10,"Obra maestra del diseño de combate, diseño de niveles y habilidades de movimiento. Este juego es puro arte."
2035,Red1HawkDJB,"May  1, 2021",10,Very fast paced gameplay and a good challenge as well. You make demons go bye bye.
2036,Leshian88,"May  1, 2021",10,"If you are a monster don't watch or play this game! Otherwise what not to like big guns, chainsaw, and all the monsters you can vanquish and then some!"
2037,Bullcrap65,"May  1, 2021",10,This game is just god like i don't know how to explain it is just amazing you can kill demons whenever however you want but beware its a lot lot more difficult than 2016 this you have to combo and be moving around so if you want a challenge and love killing demons this is the game for you.
2038,Twireiou06,"May  1, 2021",9,-good soundtrack-lots of guns-pushes you to manage guns and ammo-very detailed areas/ fun game play-short- medium game (not 100%ing)
2039,ZBug98,"May  1, 2021",10,Great game with lots and lots of demons and fighting and battling and dying a lot of dying.
2040,Hellwanker129,"May  1, 2021",10,"Good cool, good music and also superb gameplay. I just wish snapmap is added back or better mod support is released."
2041,Darkbydesign89,"May  3, 2021",10,"This is a masterpiece. The game does everything right, it cuts no corners, and it kicks ass."
2042,Jindubra6,"May  3, 2021",9,"Graphics and game play are awesome. Leaps and bounds difference from the original game, but still no where near as scary..."
2043,King2von,"May  3, 2021",9,Very fun game with one of the best soundtracks I've heard. I have nothing else to add just play it.
2044,CrazyChomper1,"May  3, 2021",10,"One of my favorite games of all time. From the combat, music and levels this game is pretty much perfect."
2045,Goodthink20221,"May  3, 2021",10,"A visual masterpiece paired with incredibly challenging, enjoyable and well designed gameplay."
2046,Scarfulhu1111,"May  3, 2021",10,"Quite simply one of the best FPS games ever made. Not an easy task, given how much history the genre has and how much Doom Eternal has to match up to in its own series alone, but this game pushes the bar in pretty much every direction. Building on the solid but occasionally humdrum foundation of Doom 2016, Eternal refines and balances the gameplay to raise the skill ceiling and engage the player."
2047,Jonathan03,"May  3, 2021",10,"Great sounds track and gameplay. I really recommend this game, its one of my favs"
2048,Trenblone9,"May  3, 2021",10,"One of the best FPS games I have played recently. The gameplay, the music, the ambience all ads up to the overall experience."
2049,Blaze721,"May  3, 2021",10,"Great game overall. Much better story and lore,better mechanics and better gameplay than DOOM 2016."
2050,Pr1meOne,"May  3, 2021",9,"its pretty cool. No like seriously, this game is fun as hell! i recommend it if you like shooters with alot of movement."
2051,Rageking33,"May  3, 2021",10,"If you know, you know. Just play the game, its amazing. Dashing around and jumping around the map is fun as hell."
2052,Tryronjames79,"May  3, 2021",10,This game is so amazing i love it so much i love it my balls are hard. The game for true alphas.
2053,Inferno1256,"May  4, 2021",10,"This game is a masterpiece. There are no other words to describe it. Every mechanic is perfectly balanced to create a perfect combat loop that is fun and infinitely replayable. The only complaint about this game is that the purple goo mechanic wasn't properly introduced in the base game, but this is such a minor complaint in such a perfect video game."
2054,Ghanm94,"May  7, 2021",10,"Guns, Guts, and Metal. If you are thinking about buying this game, do. Rip and Tear."
2055,Saltbae4,"May  7, 2021",10,The blood flow insanely when you play this. Something gets bigger when you beat the game.
2056,Smallpipe992,"May  7, 2021",9,"Good graphics good game. Feels good to move, feels good to shoot, feels good to play."
2057,Hmmphfanboi2,"May  7, 2021",10,"Its awesome game, if you`re struggling to win. Just get gud. Thats all dumbos."
2058,Ben1kingsly,"May  7, 2021",10,"This is my favourite fps shooter. The soundtracks puts me in a blood-lust state. Learning to quick swap weapons and use all of my weapons in battle is so satisfying, no game has made me feel this powerful."
2059,Reversepooper14,"May  7, 2021",10,"Everything about this game has been not only a learning curve for me but also reminded me of why I love video games as I have felt that the industry has been dying for the past 10+ years with all honesty. The sound design is just beyond words every weapon, enemy sounds to the insane soundtrack written by Mick Gordon just sounds so sharp and crisp. The weight of the game is really brought forward through the heaviness in the music and the carnage coinciding with the fast paced gameplay. The mechanics are perfected all around for every situation you can think of, there's always room for the player to adapt, improve and mentally think through every part of the combat. Doom 2016 felt as though it relied a little too heavily on nostalgia while not providing much new innovation, while Doom Eternal here does have some nostalgia it really elevates the genre forward with it's complete overhaul of new additions and changes to the mechanics where the difficulty is really rewarding."
2060,Richard5vondick,"May  7, 2021",9,"It is a great game, I have not beaten it. I recommend playing on easy even if you are really good at FPS games, because it is very very difficult. Despite the fact it is difficult it is very fun and has a lot of story and things to do. I highly recommend it."
2061,Skellydoot666,"May  7, 2021",10,"The gameplay is incredible, the feeling of power and mastery that comes with time is exactly what you could expect from a DOOM game. It adds a few welcome changes to DOOM 2016, a game that already felt so good to play. Every fight is superbly designed. Movement feels awesome. The game's length is perfect to keep its diversity all along."
2062,Doyouliftbro40,"May  7, 2021",9,"Great game, checks all the boxes. Graphics, control, story, level design, all spot on and wrapped up nicely in a technically sound package that runs perfectly."
2063,Spicymale74,"May  8, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is everything a game should fricken be. Games like mortal combat in a shooter.
2064,Lgoi34,"May  8, 2021",10,This game is a contender for best FPS of all time. Easily in the top 5 GOATs.
2065,Prometheus1241,"May 10, 2021",9,"DOOM: ETERNAL's formula is just great. It makes the combat so intensive that you are probably going to jump out of your pants multiple times. Mick Gordon's music is simply essential. However, the setting and narrative are quite poor, and plot is simply archangel Michael's copy. This is the only reason why i cant say it is a masterpiece.Nevertheless, i recommended to try new DOOM to everyone, it is great experience. It scores third place in my top 10 shooters of the decade after Titanfall and Wolfenstein."
2066,Mon521dxian,"May 10, 2021",10,One of the best games and shooters ever made. I want more games to be like this.
2067,hcliffed,"May 16, 2021",2,"DOOM 4 didn't grab me at first, but this one.  Oh boy.  Even buying the full package for $30, what a godawful experience.  Where's Deathmatch!?  Where's that trademark DOOM music we came to love?  Why do the weapons not feel like they do anything?  The Super Shotgun, hardly a relic from the past, has become a weak, wimpy throaway.  I don't want a hook attached to the damned thing, where's the bullet spread, like in DOOM 2!? This game is an insult to PC Gamers, especially: Visuals:  4/5Sound Design:  2/5Controls:  1/5Fun Factor 1/5"
2068,Spike23ja,"May 17, 2021",9,Very good game. Would highly recommend to fps players. I love the soundtrack.
2069,Protection6,"May 17, 2021",9,The modern equivalent of a stress ball. Real fun to blow off steam and have a blast.
2070,Dishonor-that45,"May 17, 2021",9,"Nice game to relax to, you won't understand the story without watching like 2h of videos, but the game is not about the story, it's about slashing and shines in that aspect."
2071,Mrag31059,"May 17, 2021",10,"Maybe he is a God. Maybe he represents human kind's rage - their will to persevere, to overcome that which would threaten our survival. He is uncompromising, a relentless being of violence that knows no mention of the hesitation shown by our many leaders and politicians during our time of judgement. Can he overcome them? Alone? If he can't - we, as a species, ALL species, will not survive. The only thing they fear - is him. We watched as the horde overwhelmed the very best and most advanced machinery and weapons technology that we could muster against the opposition. It was useless, they moved too quickly, they cared not for themselves, only sought out the blood of humanity. They were willing to sacrifice their own to get to the heart of our world. We slaughtered thousands and millions more followed, but then he came - he cut through them like a sickle through a field - his fury surpassing their own. He is faster - more relentless. I believe him now to be more than just a man - he is...DOOM."
2072,Cruxfold52,"May 17, 2021",10,"Best single player FPS I've ever played. This game is incredibly involved, and that will likely be a huge obstacle for first time Doom Eternal players, and it might even enrage them; it did for me. I highly recommend at least keeping visual tutorials on. I personally turned off the tutorials that pull you to the demo room, but many of you might be tempted to turn off all tutorials. Turning off all of the tutorials will likely make every one of your big arena battles absolutely miserable because they throw every enemy, that you're supposed to understand how to fight at that point, at you in a single fight. It is really fun and exciting when you know the enemies weaknesses, because you are firing on all cylinders and using all your tools in the right way. All in all, great visuals, great gameplay, interesting story, 10/10 game in my book."
2073,Supermaciak78,"May 17, 2021",10,"This is best single player fps that I ever played, and I played a lot.Combat mechanics, lore, music, performance, visuals, level design, its masterpiece 10/10"
2074,Potatohead10,"May 17, 2021",10,"If you can't solve a problem with violence, then It's because you're not using enough."
2075,Spiteful_jesse7,"May 17, 2021",10,"I have already beaten the PS4 edition on my PS5 and both dlcs, But I love this game so freaking much and to be honest the PC version is better the controls are easy to adapt to and I am running a solid 250 fps."
2076,Flow4state,"May 17, 2021",10,"Amp up the difficulty to get the most out of this game. Story is alright, lore is better, gameplay top-notch. Recommend getting the DLC on sale, but they are a must. At their worst, it feels like more DOOM; at their best, the base game feels like a tutorial and this is where the real game starts."
2077,Arnaughtsz29,"May 17, 2021",10,This is the best first person shooter I have ever played and possibly the most fun I have had playing a singleplayer in a videogame.
2078,Realumanbeen43,"May 17, 2021",10,"One of the most engaging gameplay ever, Fast Phased Action, and lots of fun."
2079,Equalizenear98,"May 17, 2021",10,10/10 recommended for people who want to shoot a hole into the surface of Mars.
2080,Gamblebaggy61,"May 17, 2021",9,"Great game, not for wusses. you better be ready to rip n tear with the ferocity of the doom slayer and you better be ready to earn it."
2081,Shark8king,"May 17, 2021",9,An awesome game about killing demons. This is basically what I see and imagine on a screen. A game I highly recommend.
2082,Cabbagehead1129,"May 17, 2021",10,DOOM Eternal is another amazing game and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging experience with lots of action and gore!
2083,Lostinsnasnity3,"May 17, 2021",10,"Fun and family friendly, unless your family worships Satan. I must admit, the extra controls compared to 2016 were a pain to get used to, especially as i am a grade 11 dumb ass with 3 brain cells, but when you get used to it, its a whole new level of fun and saying i love it is an understatement. I learned how to play a speedy game like this from Shadow warrior 2, and that only just helped when it came to teaching the player the type of aggression needed. I will be honest, i did start on easy unlike everyone else, but to be honest, i would recommend it because if you are mentally slow like me, take awhile to learn new play styles, or just want stress relief through shotgun exorcism, it's fine to go easy. Nobody's judging you. As a final note, strangely i got a weird vibe from the boss design that made me think of a lot of styles from past video games, like pre-2013 i think. it was fun to have a game where i didn't have to sneak around or avoid a nuclear rocket powered bullet sponge with a sword the size of Texas. Really helps to feel like a game rather than just dark souls with a shotgun or a political statement.100/5"
2084,Bandmisty4,"May 17, 2021",10,Worth every penny. Cant stop thinking about ripping and tearing occasionally and just have to get back on the game.
2085,Depriveall75,"May 17, 2021",10,Better than DOOM(2016) in every department except the horror side but I don't see that as a problem.
2086,Crowd_square770,"May 17, 2021",10,"The combat is amazing, and so is the parkour. The puzzles are also amazing and it is overall an amazing game!"
2087,Explosivepoop8,"May 17, 2021",10,"Much higher octane than the last game. Also a lot more brutal, almost to the point of being too hard. Around level 4 or 5 is when it really clicked though. Very worth it."
2088,Lizardperson666,"May 17, 2021",10,"Was skeptical at first about the game, but I started playing, then I couldn't stop. It's just so much fun. Lots of secrets to unlock, the battles are super fun. I love it!"
2089,Yokedman90,"May 17, 2021",9,"Very good game I would recommend to buy it if you think about it just buy it, you will have a lot of fun and the story is good and the gameplay also good so just chill out and buy it."
2090,Linginer2721,"May 18, 2021",10,"A few bugs but overall amazing game, good job id. I would like more mod support in future but oh well."
2091,Borckin35,"May 18, 2021",10,its for sure the best FPS Game on the Market. Better than every shooter including Doom 2016.
2092,Hotapeh176,"May 18, 2021",10,"I am LOVING this game. I haven't tried multiplayer because the single player is so amazing. I was shocked at how much fun I was having. Soundtrack of heavy metal to go along with the murdering of demonic forces is one of the best combinations ever. Highly, highly recommend!"
2093,Cabatz5,"May 18, 2021",10,"Compared to DOOM 2016, Eternals improved movement mechanics, gunplay and level design makes this the better game overall."
2094,Paddie4389,"May 18, 2021",9,Great game but kind of hard but really fun really recommend. I had a blast play it.
2095,Fakourn92,"May 18, 2021",10,"Playing on the second highest difficulty and game is loads of fun. Great aim trainer, awesome melee kills that I will never get bored of, and a plethora of different weapon types. Doom has always felt more of a ""Gamey Game"" to me, and Doom Eternal is a huge step up from Doom 2016 in that sense by returning too its roots. While Doom 2016 looked very good and captured its environment perfectly it felt like that's all there was to it, an ambient shooting game with horror aspects, but Doom Eternal fixes that by making the game feel more arcade-y as it used to be."
2096,Milosilo79,"May 18, 2021",10,It's just 20+ hours of absolutely perfected FPS. Don't go in looking for deep character development or an intricate crafting system - all of that would just take away from being a superb FPS.
2097,Captchsux11,"May 18, 2021",10,"Best Shooter I've ever played, absolutely worth it even at full price. What a game."
2098,4Poggermydudes,"May 18, 2021",10,"I remember playing DOOM 2016 when I was younger. Coming back to the DOOM series 5 years later, by playing DOOM Eternal it feels so nostalgic to me, ripping and tearing through demons, I highly recommend this game."
2099,Neo-Rio4,"May 18, 2021",10,"I played this game and had Quake III Arena flashbacks. You can appreciate what id have done here by merging the classic Doom gameplay with it's hundreds of onscreen demons and mixing it with Quake III-esque maps. Then they've tweaked and balanced the weapons and gameplay systems so that each wave will result in a huge number of satisfying chain kills in an extremely fast-paced and violent fashion. The end result? Something absolutely amazing. Visually this game will smash your GPU and produce some amazing visuals. There's a thumping metal soundtrack (if you like that sort of thing), and an incredibly playable and balanced game which lets you play-how-you-like with the huge number of perks you can add to your suit and weapons. It's a great game. No doubt about it."
2100,Yacobims801,"May 18, 2021",10,"Compared to DOOM 2016, the combat has definitely been improved and the weapons feel nicer to use. Also, the visuals are absolutely stunning at times. The glory kills are more brutal than 2016, with the addition of a blade as part of the Doomslayer's arsenal and ""improved"" blood effects. I don't really enjoy that change, but I think the gameplay more than makes up for it. The soundtrack is similar to 2016 but feels a little more diverse and punch-y. Overall this feels like a refined sequel to DOOM 2016. If you like high-intensity skill-based gameplay,"
2101,Xoomer3,"May 19, 2021",10,"I've only completed the game on the easiest difficulty because I do find it quite challenging. Doom Eternal does such a good job of making everything spectacular. The gunplay? Amazing. The arenas? Always varying and great. The pace? Amazing. Incentive to explore every part of the level? With ammo drops, health/armor pickups, codex entries, collectibles and cheat codes, absolutely. Every level is so incredibly detailed, the scenery beyond the structures you walk around is stunning. Platforming isn't perfect, but I think it provides a little break between big arenas, and helps the flow of the game (this is a pretty controversial thing tho, some people are okay with it, and some people hate it). You can really formulate your own playstyle with the weapon variety and weapon mods that are accessible to you. I found myself switching between 3 different playstyles throughout my playthrough."
2102,Ironhand11,"May 19, 2021",10,Nonstop action. Nonstop intense combat. Nonstop pogging. Nonstop improving. Nonstop slaying. Rip and tear until it is done.

2105,Yoloswagger100,"May 19, 2021",10,I would say Doom Eternal gameplay is soo well designed and unique it makes other shooters look like crap.
2106,Freddymac7,"May 19, 2021",10,"Great game, great aim trainer, great graphics. love the platforming parts. And the Slayer Gate Challenges prolly one of my favorites."
2107,Lendyz402,"May 19, 2021",10,"As a child born in late 90s, I've played old iD games (Doom 1993, Doom 2, Quake 2 and Quake 3 Arena). This game is something that made my memories come back. It's fun, gory, fast-paced old school FPS game. Unlike DOOM 2016 it's not that dark atmospheric in-door game, it's more arcady (which I really like). This doesn't mean that I didn't like 2016.Pros: Everything - soundtrack, gameplay, gunplay, jumping sections, YEEThooking, BFG 9k and 10k, resource management via chainsaw, flame belch, glory kills (if you're an ignorant person who doesn't want to adapt to the game and follow it's resource management - don't play it)Cons: The demons killed your bunny, demons die very quickly."

2110,Roganine48,"May 19, 2021",10,"DOOM: Eternal is my favorite video game ever. This is due to the fast combat, the ""combat loop"" (the ability to use many different weapons for different types of combat, and the jaw-dropping graphics.

2117,Dono33,"May 19, 2021",10,This is the best arena fps on the market. There is no competition or equal even its predecessor sucks compared to this. Anyone saying otherwise has brain damage or wants a brain dead easy fps.
2118,CerafM,"May 19, 2021",9,"DOOM eternal is seriously a very good sequel (it's hard to find a good sequel these days that surpasses the original ) , it feels like a modern DOOM experience and nails everything that i loved about the originals, Hugh martin as a director really understood what Doom needed in this game and innovated in many ways. The lore is so satisfying and Mick gordon's soundtrack plays with your emotions, the graphics and animations are gorgeous and this sequel really builds upon 2016's DOOM. If you're a fan of any kind of shooter, definitely check this game out."
2119,Sepherim,"May 20, 2021",8,"Doom Eternal es exactamente lo que debe ser: una loca orgía de sangre y violencia, donde los combates son una descarga de adrenalina continua. Pero no es simplemente un mata-mata, sino que cada enemigo tiene sus puntos débiles y estrategias, cada arma sus virtudes y utilidades, de modo que una vez que entras en su flow, es como una especie de extraña coreografía de vísceras y muerte. La historia continua la del Doom 2016 y amplía su universo y trasfondo, dándole una extraña coherencia que es tan over-the-top como todo el resto del juego. Aquí eres el Doom Slayer, lo de los puzzles y tal quedan para otros, aquí no venimos a ser humanos y tener que tener en cuenta cosas como el estress postraumático o las consecuencias de la guerra, esto es pura ira desatada. Y los momentos más tranquilos, sirven para explorar y saltar, coleccionando los numerosos objetos que hay para encontrar en cada mapa. A nivel gráfico el juego es una pasada. No solo en ejecución, que también, sino principalmente a nivel de diseño, con unos enemigos muy carismáticos y bien diferenciados y unas localizaciones y escenarios mucho más variadas de lo que esperaba. La música es una descarga de adrenalina similar a la jugabilidad, haciendo que nos metamos en ese duro universo de violencia y energía y mantegamos el foco en cada enemigo, cada esquiva y movimiento. Los efectos sonoros están bastante bien, igual que el doblaje de las voces. Y, al menos en mi caso, apenas me encontré un par de salidas a escritorio en todo el juego, ningún otro bug. El resultado es, sin duda, que Doom Eternal da lo que promete. Rip and tear! Un 8,5."

2124,Mecmec7,"May 20, 2021",10,"En fait, l'un de mes jeux préférés auxquels j'ai jamais joué et il peut encore être amélioré avec de **** changements. Il a certains des combats FPS les plus amusants jamais créés dans un jeu vidéo, il a non seulement une mécanique phénoménale, mais une conception ennemie complexe et une IA pour vraiment tester ces compétences. La direction prise avec l'histoire est bonne, mais peut être améliorée en définissant davantage Doomguy comme un personnage et en rappelant aux gens pourquoi il est un maître chef fou qui veut tuer tous les démons, certains flashbacks font des événements de Doom 1,2 et 64 aideraient et donnerait également plus de répliques à l'acteur sous-estimé de Doomguy pour montrer à quel point il est capricieux. La valeur de rejouabilité de ce jeu n'est pas portée par le contenu post-jeu simplement par la force de la formule principale, je continue de jouer à tous les niveaux de ce jeu et c'est du dlc encore et encore et cela n'est pas encore ennuyeux. Le jeu est non seulement visuellement incroyable, mais aussi incroyablement bien optimisé pour un jeu de génération actuel (la taille du fichier est d'environ 20 Go de moins que le jeu précédent). La bande originale de ce jeu est vraiment emblématique, qu'il s'agisse de pistes de combat ou de morceaux d'ambiance, il n'y a pas un seul mauvais morceau de musique dans ce jeu, et cela vaut également pour la musique dlc. Je me surprends à écouter les morceaux du DLC en dehors du jeu plus que les morceaux originaux."
2125,Johntheweak2,"May 20, 2021",10,This game is so sick. 100% worth it. The gameplay is the most slick and fluid ever made.
2126,Cuantica13,"May 20, 2021",9,"Juego muy sólido. La música es para matar (y lo harás en abundancia). Si es nuevo, al principio se sentirá un poco abrumador, pero lo dominará rápidamente. Es un juego que sin disculpas te hace dominado. Es refrescante sentirse así si juegas juegos competitivos la mayor parte del tiempo. No puedo pensar en muchos protagonistas que sean tan rudos como Doom Slayer."
2127,Caseria57,"May 20, 2021",10,"Incredibilmente divertente da giocare. Ti richiede di imparare e di abbracciare le nuove meccaniche, ma una volta che lo fai è così soddisfacente giocare. Enormi quantità di divertimento. Ho appena completato il mio primo playthrough su incubo e non vedo l'ora di giocare ai dlc.Non ho avuto un singolo arresto anomalo e il gioco funziona perfettamente."
2128,Dogcoinshill0,"May 20, 2021",10,GOD Game. This game on Nightmare is one of the best FPS campaigns ever made.

2130,Slyflykigh240,"May 20, 2021",9,Get the BASE GAME ONLY. Unless you want to slog through mediocre DLC. Like everyone said gameplay loop is really good and unlike some dumbasses say theres actually many creative ways to kill mobs. The combat tips aren't even the best ways to kill enemies just ignore it.
2131,Liberta9113,"May 20, 2021",10,"I was surprised just how much I enjoyed this, being a huge fan of the old original Doom growing up. Fantastically optimized game that will look phenomenal even on older hardware. They've done a great job with this one, and I'm actually disappointed I waited so long to play it!"
2132,Cultleader84,"May 20, 2021",10,"You could say this game is pretty amazing, I guess. I have not played a good fps game that isn't multiplayer in a while. This game met all my expectations and more and delivered a satisfying experience without having to resort to multiplayer"

2134,Gabagool99,"May 20, 2021",10,"Masterpiece for people who likes movements and dominating demons. It is however an ACT/FPS game.

Have fun."

The environment story telling in this game is sooo amazing, the landscapes is just too beautiful for a fps game like this. 666/10."

2147,Ramsquaddled34,"May 22, 2021",10,"I have never, ever played a game which feels this fluid, fun and engaging, this game deserves to be in history book, this should be what game devs strive for, not make a bunch of stupid option like stealth, loud ect, just focus on one aspect which is fun, and make you game that, I love this game to death, and I will always regard it as a master of game design and the best game of the millennium."
2148,AnnouncerDance7,"May 22, 2021",10,One problem with this is game. Playing this game will absolutely ruin other shooters for you.

2155,Tarust005,"May 22, 2021",10,"If you like a challenge with smooth game mechanics, amazing graphics, ripping and tearing apart any and everything this is the game for you. While you are constantly killing demons the different opponents, glory kills, weapons, and difficulty keep it fresh and highly re-playable. I started on ultra-violent and even though I have played fps games for YEARS I struggled for a while. Definitely a must have for any FPS fan."
2156,Doometmo433,"May 22, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is crack cocaine. I cannot recall the last time I ever waited for the night a game came out and waited until I could open it after preloading the game. I then played the game to near completion in one sitting until I nearly passed out from physical exhaustion as the sun crept through my window. After sleeping that night I woke up and immediately turned the game on and finished it; I couldn't get enough of it. I cannot recommend Doom Eternal highly enough; this is one of my favorite first person shooters of all time.
2157,Zenach82,"May 22, 2021",10,DOOM Eternal had a lot to live up to after DOOM (2016) and it beats it out in almost every way. All gameplay mechanics were taken up a notch from it's predecessor. The story is much more compelling and varying then the first title and the environment/atmosphere matches the game to a tee. DOOM Eternal is the best game to be released in the year 2020.
2158,Oustyeph703,"May 22, 2021",10,An amazing soundtrack with even greater gameplay. An improvement over 2016 in almost all aspects.

2160,BloomChi9,"May 22, 2021",8,"I have enjoyed all the Doom games, this was no exception. After beating them I always liked using cheats to mess around a bit with. I dislike not being able to use them until after you neat a mish, and Only if you have gathered them previously ."
2161,Teen11Laxr,"May 22, 2021",10,A great game for $60 and it is very replayable. The story is just as badass as the Doom Slayer. I played this game on Nightmare and it was refreshing to play a game that was well designed and optimized for fps.
2162,ReviewThangs,"May 23, 2021",9,"I wasn't a big fan of the reboot and the idea of a difficult HARDCORE shooter doesn't really excite me as much as most PC gamers. I honestly have no clue what the story was about and have no real interest in reading up on it. With so little in it for me, I'm surprised by how much I loved this game.I feel like the difficulty isn't really difficulty in the punishing sense but urges you to use your entire arsenal at all times, forcing you to constantly switch around weapons and tactics on the fly to exploit every weakness possible. This keeps the game fresh and exciting throughout the campaign. That with the unparalleled sense of mobility, you constantly find yourself in a groove to the heavy metal music while your senses are overloaded. The visual design is colorful and easy to navigate with split second reflexes despite the fact that it's gory demons. The sound design is a hilarious mix of cartoonish sound effects that give to it's charm.In a world of repetitive shooters which all feel like the refinement of the last, this one does something that feels completely different.I won't remember much of the game or the story, but I know that for it's respectable run time, I had constant fun, was challenged but not frustrated, and would recommend this to anyone who is up for something old that feels new."
2163,Lozi01,"May 23, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is oddly a super refreshing throw back to the original FPS. No crazy convoluted story line. No dumb gimmicks. Just go kick some ass. And the music rocks too.
2164,Fapper50,"May 23, 2021",10,Heavy metal and extreme violence. What else can you ask for from a Doom game?

2177,Leefook17,"May 23, 2021",10,"Probably the best game I've played in years, I would say play DOOM 2016 first, as Eternal has a lot of the same features and then more, but honestly, the game is really good even if you don't play 2016 first, and it's in general really good. Really, it's just an incredibly good game, considering it's a free bonus for buying this sick soundtrack, wait, I wasn't paying for the soundtrack?"

Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer."

May your thirst for retribution never quench, may the blood on your sword never dry, and may we never need you again."" 10/10 a true masterpiece of the FPS genre."
2199,Bleude9582,"May 24, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is like a metal concert where you are the frontman and jump into the moshpit with a lawnmower.
2200,Opera7mauve,"May 24, 2021",10,Excellent shooting and quite different from 2016. The changes are welcome as it improved the combat and requires more strategizing than just instinctive shooting.
2201,Celadon58,"May 24, 2021",10,Doom eternal is one of those games where you are not encouraged to find cover and shoot but instead fight head on ripping and tearing your way open there's also a few platforms and couple of simple puzzles but most of this game consists of high tension gauntlets where each fight just feels like a puzzle where you need to switch from weapon to weapon picking off demons guns or shooting at their shields with a plasma rifle and I think this adds a lot of depth to this game the need to approach each enemy with a certain method the game is also not afraid to throw you off and force you to switch strategies there's this Marauder demon who gives very little openings as a purely defensive demon and you must catch him off guard to chip away his health. Overall rip and tear is good buy it on sale.
2202,Blackolive43777,"May 24, 2021",10,"Great music, nearly every song is such a banger, plus, you get a free game along with the music."
2203,Midnightgreen7,"May 24, 2021",10,Everything you loved about DOOM 2016 ramped up to 11. It's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea because they've essentially turned a fairly straightforward shooter into the closest thing you can get to a first person character action game (Other than ULTRAKILL). There's layers and layers of complexity and split-second decision making to be made in DOOM: Eternal and whether this is a good or bad thing depends on your perspective.
2204,Xiketic49,"May 24, 2021",10,"RIP AND TEAR. Also I'm getting my ass Ripped and Teared, Love it! Uh.. You know what I mean"
2205,Periwinkle111,"May 24, 2021",10,"This has to be one of the best games that I've ever played, visually the game is just amazing, the amount environmental story telling is extremely cared for and does wonders for the imagination of how this happened and how that happened, the gameplay is extremely enjoyable as the game forces you to constantly be aware of your surroundings and manage ammo, health and armour. Oh and the Music Is amazing, Mick Gordon's work has passed through my ears so many times and each time still has the same energy, even when I'm not playing the game I still listen to the music, the use of synth and metal is such a powerful combination that makes the player (talking from experience) feel like they could kill the dark lord himself. I look forward to what comes next Id but no need to rush, this will keep me entertained for a LONG time."
2206,Gowebbed22,"May 25, 2021",10,"Probably the best shooter, like ever. Retains the spirit of original Doom 95 and builds upon it."
2207,Pawcaring2,"May 25, 2021",10,Doom guy kills demons and doesn't afraid of anything. The best violence simulator on the market. Frantic & Fun.
2208,Guiltybarb99,"May 25, 2021",10,Smooth as butter and Im a sucker for solid design themes and choices (very reminiscent of its OG style over 2016). I loved Doom 2016 but the controls are revised as they need to be for ultimate carnage.
2209,Cajolefeminine1,"May 25, 2021",10,"If you love First Person shooters and quick action, you'll likely love this game. Especially if blood and gore doesn't make you squeamish. Definitly better than it's predecessor (You should still play it) it made the game somewhat arcadey like it used to be, but a ton more fast paced. It also has plenty of difficulty options for weaker folks like myself that make the game less punishing but still make you feel like you are in the Slayer's shoes. I'd say give this game a try, finding all the Codexes, secrets, and experiencing the story was great fun."
2210,Krisserious532,"May 25, 2021",10,It's pretty good. I enjoyed it more than the last doom they made. Nice game.
2211,Envious_ray87,"May 25, 2021",10,"Best Shooting Game I played. Period. Doom Eternal is a face paced shooter that heavily improves upon the 2016 Doom Entry. The most notable improvement to the game allows the doomslayer to be much more agile and nimble compared to his 2016 counterpart. Unlike other shooters, you are rewarded for engaging enemies head on instead of finding cover. As a result, this game is much more fun compared to your cover shooter."
2212,Mmustric20,"May 25, 2021",9,"I hate spoilers, so I won't put any, but if you like ripping and tearing with a great story buy this game.Pros - great graphics, game play and story.Cons - some battle sequences are long resulting in lack of sleep."
2213,El_dino959,"May 25, 2021",8,i don't think there is another shooter that has achieved this level of difficulty tweaking. It really makes you give your all to progress. The issue is that longer fights are just too intensive and it is hard to maintain the focus and performance level needed to power through. I may be getting too old for this stuff...
2214,Lustrous148,"May 25, 2021",10,"I love this game, everyone loves this game. But Bethesta forgot to remove the weird bugs like where a Dread knight was launched faster than fans clicking the purchase button. or the other time where i got softlocked and had to reload. but other than those Mild bugs there is really smooth physics and a rich entertaining story."
2215,James64,"May 25, 2021",10,One of the greatest shooters I've ever played. Its one of the best shooters.
2216,Bong1lorobe3,"May 25, 2021",10,This is a epic fps with the unique story line and previous story line that adds up and mashes together.
2217,Meatman5855,"May 25, 2021",10,The goat of shooters basically. Basically beats Doom 2016 out in every way.
2218,Franaie1209,"May 25, 2021",10,"if you took pure testosterone and rage, imbued it into an awesome game this is it."
2219,Fraglang3489,"May 25, 2021",9,"Fun fast paced shooter, even better than DOOM. Great music, enemies and guns!"
2220,Solarous1940,"May 25, 2021",10,This game does not around. Its brutaly hard but oh so rewarding. DOOM 2016 makes you feel like a badass but DOOM ETERNAL makes you earn it. Fights that felt unfair becomes a breeze when you return with renewed arsenal and skills. The combat is amazingly good and forces you to think on the run.
2221,Yelsie80,"May 25, 2021",10,"Good game, Buy it. Play it. If you have difficulties, don'T be afraid to google stuff. The marauder isn't bs, you're just bad and you don't know it. Google some strat, try some of that, you'll see how well it goes. The game force you to learn the mechanics. Learn weapon combo and quick swap. Use the meathook and jump or go left/right. I'm still a noob though, I 100% one save in ultra violence."
2222,Noved31z,"May 25, 2021",10,66.6 hours in & i cant think of a better shooter. 10/10 play the campaign on nightmare.
2223,BrainlessCowork,"May 26, 2021",9,I've officially finished doom twice on two different platforms. (Xbox+Pc) This game is amazing exactly what I wanted. It's a very polished shooter. The only downside to this game is that they throw random platforming puzzles at you when your moving to the next area. They are not hard its just annoying to have to do in the middle of a shoot out. Besides that if you liked the first remake of Doom then your going to love this also.
2224,Musty69,"May 26, 2021",10,It takes what you know from the Doom and than gives you crack. Huwat a game.
2225,Jwny54,"May 26, 2021",10,لعبة رائعة. رسومات ومناظر رائعة ، ألعاب نارية رائعة ، شياطين قابلة للتدمير مرضية بشكل لا يصدق.
2226,Swolenman222,"May 26, 2021",10,"No me gustan los juegos de disparos de estilo arcade en los que simplemente atraviesas (o aplastas y aplasta en este caso) hordas de enemigos con relativa facilidad. Me enamoré de Doom 2016, especialmente en el modo pesadilla. Pensé que un juego no podía ser más emocionante o desafiante. Bueno, entra en Doom Eternal. Es muy exigente para el jugador y de ritmo superrápido. Tanto es así que cuando volví a Doom 2016 estaba aburrido. Así que ahí está, el juego que pensé que era perfecto (Doom 2016) me aburre ahora. Eso es lo que es Doom Eternal."
2227,Bettestar71,"May 26, 2021",10,"I have nearly 60 hours in it, and I've beaten it twice and am about to beat my third playthrough on the nightmare difficulty. I do not play many FPS shooters, but with that being said this is one of the best games I gotten to play, I love the fast paced combat loop, and enjoy the new elements they put into this game as well. They obviously don't put much into the story, but as someone who enjoys their lore, I really like the way they have implemented it into the game. I recommend this to anyone who has a passing interest in games like this, and am really excited for what they are doing next in the doom franchise. Needless to say I've gotten hooked."
2228,Cavedinbrain919,"May 26, 2021",10,"Well balanced & distinctive weapons & mods. Great level design & graphics & puzzles. Variety of well thought enemies. Challenging enemies & bosses. Long. 30+ hours, nice soundtrack and story. Overall one of the best shooters made."
2229,Yanorak8,"May 26, 2021",9,"Lots of fun, especially when you get into the rhythm of quick swapping and moving around."
2230,Shankar897,"May 26, 2021",10,"Amazing game and sequel.  Haven't had this much fun with a FPS since well, Doom 2016."
2231,KunalKohli662,"May 26, 2021",10,Best shooter gameplay wise hands down no question in that. Base game is a solid 10.
2232,Bluemoon2496,"May 26, 2021",10,"If you want to be a badass and kill demons, look no further. Absolutely awesome gameplay, with enough story to give doomguy a sense of personality. But most importantly, you're a badass killing machine."
2233,Fearfulali70,"May 28, 2021",9,This game is fantastic. The only problem is that every other first person shooter now is underwhelming because they're not doom eternal. The combat is the central focus and it is better than anything else in the genre. The platforming sections are also pretty good (and a big step up from doom 2016). The story is also pretty good and not so plentiful as to get in the way. The graphics are very good this feels like a next gen game.
2234,Souli62,"May 28, 2021",8,Jeu vraiment amusant et solide avec une bande-son incroyable. Je n'ai rien d'autre à ajouter.
2235,Mrampf38,"May 28, 2021",9,"Ich versuche nach mehr als einem Jahrzehnt Pause wieder zum Spielen zurückzukehren. dachte, ich würde das Schicksal aufgreifen, weil du weißt, dass das ursprüngliche Schicksal ziemlich großartig war, oder? Dieses Spiel hat meine Erwartungen weit übertroffen. Ich mag das Gleichgewicht, das es schafft, Kettensägen-Kills für Munition zu jonglieren, um Kills für die Gesundheit zu erzielen, und Flammen-Burps für Rüstungen. Die absolute Notwendigkeit, das richtige Werkzeug für die Waffenarbeit zu verwenden. Ich mag die Tatsache, dass Blutschläge bestimmte Feinde sofort töten. Ich mag sogar die Tatsache, dass Sie keine speziellen Tastaturkürzel für das Fragment und die Eisbombe haben, was ein zusätzliches Level erfordert, wenn Sie einen großen Kerl zum Teufel spammen wollen. Denken Sie daran, ich bin in jenen Tagen ziemlich grün, in denen jemand, der mit FPS-Spielen ziemlich klassisch ist, das System möglicherweise nicht mag. Für mich ist dies ziemlich erfrischend im Vergleich zu einem durchschnittlichen."
2236,Davysadistic668,"May 28, 2021",10,"Lots of people are scared off by the skill level the game requires, but I encourage you to suffer through it anyway, the game forces you to get better, and the better you get the more fun you have with the game. After my first playthrough of the game I noticed a clear and tangible increase in my skill, and I am currently on my third playthrough, challenging myself on nightmare mode."
2237,Dlurelectric43,"May 28, 2021",10,This game is one of the best modern shooters there is nowadays Doom eternal is one of those games that has the perfect balance between feeling overpowered and still giving a challenge.
2238,Lienatedjas82,"May 28, 2021",10,Best FPS game i ever played. its a very cool game and its satisfyingly awesome.
2239,Songfong75,"May 28, 2021",10,A masterpiece of a game for a masterpiece franchise. Doom Eternal is THE way to play modern doom and or fast first person shooters. the combat is unmatched in fast paced arena combat with chess like mechanics to keep you on your toes.
2240,Gigsaw876,"May 28, 2021",9,It is a fun game to play when you feel like i wanna slay some demons and listen to some hardcore music.
2241,Robotoian9409,"May 28, 2021",9,"Having never played a Doom game before in my life, this was really easy to pick up and learn and enjoy. I generally hate bullet hell type games, so the fact that avoiding fire wasn't impossible (but still punishing when you made a wrong move) was a surprise to me. The story and plot are really fun, and in general the game does a good job of making you feel like a badass."
2242,J1imbo,"May 28, 2021",10,Best shooter I have ever played. This game on nightmare difficulty is probably the most fun I have ever had in a game.
2243,Drdrhosin4986,"May 28, 2021",9,"Excellent shooter for old fans of the series, or folks just looking for a solid FPS experience."
2244,Punslayer3000,"May 28, 2021",9,"I really do recommend this game to anyone who hasn't bought it yet, very fun game that can be played many ways, only problem is there isn't much to do after you do the campaign, besides pvp or modded levels. I love this game but it is hard to replay for me since it requires so much time skill, its not very good at being a game you can play every once and awhile, it requires constant attention."
2245,Vurik31257,"May 28, 2021",10,"This is best game I've played in a while. The combat is fluid with every gun being fun to use and actually viable. Obviously the super shotgun (double barrel) steals the show but it always has. The levels are so thought out and cleverly detailed with hidden collectables to find throughout the game. Most collectables are figures or codex entries but you can also find items to upgrade your guns, suit and abilities.The glory kills make the game a blast to play! Depending on where you look at an enemy when stunned, you will do a different glory kill (think finishers in mortal combat but faster). Unlike Doom 2016, Doom Eternal has enough variety in glory kills to make them still fun 40+ hours in! The whole gameplay loop of shooting enemies, glory killing them for health, lighting them on fire for shields and chainsawing enemies for ammo creates such a unique and fun cycle that never gets old. It's so satisfying to light a bunch of enemies on fire just to blow them up with a singe rocket and getting a billion armour/health drops. I heard some people complain that Doom Eternal has a story but most of them clearly didn't play the game. The story is literally people telling the Doom Slayer he can't defeat the demons and then he goes to defeat them anyway because f*#k demons. The codex entries are there for those who do want to delve into some Doom lore. It's not essential although it contains a very interesting twist on the whole Heaven and Hell thing. The multiplayer is fun but I haven't spent much time on it as I buy a doom game for the singleplayer. Worth full price"
2246,Gaymer2078,"May 28, 2021",10,I've been playing Doom: Eternal regularly since launch and still love it. It will be one of those games I keep coming back to time and time again for the rest of my life and it's easily up there as one of my favorite games of all time.
2247,T3enderslender,"May 28, 2021",9,"Pros:- The soundtrack is phenomenal- The movement and combat is fluid, more so than any other recent game that I can think of- The art design is just spot onCons:- The story isn't the best, it's not bad, but it doesn't achieve the same level of quality as the other parts that make up the game"
2248,Newell3,"May 28, 2021",9,"This one is definitely more intricate than the last one and requires more thinking, so you can't just run at everything with the super shotgun. But man these 2 games are so good my god."
2249,Rimmly2185,"May 28, 2021",10,The most frustrating and satisfying game I have ever played. Biggest dopamine rush ever!
2250,777Burger,"May 28, 2021",10,"To put it simply, its a fast paced shooter that forces you to experience every weapon for every monster. it's challenging enough to question your gaming abilities. but most importantly it's worth the deluxe price to pay in full. you need to buy this game to show the gaming industry what a good product looks like."
2251,Sugmy7793,"May 28, 2021",10,"Hands down the best single player shooter made in the last 20 years. Endlessly replayable. I love the monster variety and that they bring back some of the older doom aesthetics with the possessed soldiers, archvile, and plasma gun. Big fan. Rip and tear until it is done."

2253,Almaic91,"May 29, 2021",9,"I am a terrible shooter player, and even besides that, this gave me the full experience of smashing and shooting. Very gory. Very stressful. Believe whatever you read about this game :) especially about the soundtrack and combat being good."

2261,Po2man,"May 29, 2021",9,"Fast paced. Too intense for long sessions, but always delivers the thrills I need when I have to escape from a stressful day. Some bits are insanely hard until you crack it, like a puzzle, and that feeling is why I love this game. Plus the music is dope."
2262,Joosh5159,"May 29, 2021",10,"Father of the FPS genre came and took his crown again. At first look you think this game is too similar to Doom 2016 but oh boy you are wrong. ID Software took another step in the right direction and made the game more satisfying, worth to invest time on beating hard modes. The more you play, the more you'll RIP AND TEAR."

2266,Lowhighball9,"May 29, 2021",10,One of the best FPS games I have ever played! The gameplay is insanely fast paced that it can give you an adrenaline rush from all of nasty stuff happening. Couple it with the best soundtrack for sure you will never stop killing demons until hell freezes over. Another thing I liked about this is the optimization where you can easily run 144+ fps with a mid tier PC/Laptop.
2267,Tortellini34,"May 29, 2021",10,"This game deserves the badge of coolest game ever created. I grew up on Quake 1 & 2, And the Half Life series. I don't get impressed easily. But some parts of this game blew my mind. The more you play, the further you advance, the more fun it becomes. Completed the campaign on ultra-violence and I had a lot of fun doing so."

2276,Dee9pc,"May 31, 2021",9,"Its a great game, good story, good gameplay, and good quality. The only problems I have with the game are problems of my own creation such as, its a demanding game and I have a lower quality pc. So if you have a pc with the minimum requirements on the steam page then go for it. Lower quality is playable but just very laggy."
2277,Acidicwater66,"May 31, 2021",9,Likes : Simply AMAZING graphics - best ever for a Doom game. The shooter experience too is fast & great. Dislikes: Would have liked the demons to look a bit larger in size on the screen.

2280,Pissearth666,"May 31, 2021",9,Its like Doom 2016 with superior gameplay. Wished there was more to it but a fun gaming romp anyways. Get on sale.
2281,Open5pdfjack,"May 31, 2021",10,"If you want a fantastic single-player experience with amazing graphics, music and gameplay, get this game. If you don't want to make a Bethesda account just to access the game on startup, steer clear; unless you block the game from internet access. It's incredibly dumb that the campaign cannot be accessed without making a very insecure and rarely used account, but if you're not interested in the multiplayer mode and don't mind a bit of tweaking some windows settings to get around it, I think its worth it."

2284,Lexjans7,"May 31, 2021",9,Loved the first one so much I had to buy Doom Eternal. At times the story would lose me and some of the new game mechanics took some getting used to but overall it was a nice play through and would recommend it to anyone that wants a good run and gun.
2285,Chefquef369,"May 31, 2021",10,Great game. It has more testostorone weight lifting competition. Mechanics are amazing.
2286,Herbie_cool73,"May 31, 2021",10,"I've done 2 playthrough's of the game, and I can confidently say it is a masterpiece. The gameplay loop is extremely fun and killing demons never felt better. The game is a lot more difficult than the previous game in the series. The story is heavily improved and the many missions you go on all have detailed surroundings. And the multiplayer was really good. The new features are great and new. And last the platforming was great and helped break up the combat."

2289,Gavweird33,"Jun  7, 2021",10,"One of the best shooters I've ever played. Game play variety is beautiful, every enemy has choreographed attacks, unique abilities, making the battles feel like a chess game as you dance around the map fighting demons. The music is top notch and some of the most dynamic, god-complex inducing tracks I've ever heard in a game."

2292,Neslton18,"Jun  7, 2021",10,Amazing experience if you would like new gameplay loop. Killing hordes of demons was never this fun and challenging at the same time.
2293,Cluckers899,"Jun  7, 2021",9,This game is hard even on easy setting. The developers were having a good time creating a game that can stress people up deliberately. They know its hard that's why they give u a sentinel armor option if u die more than 3x in a fight.. pretty insulting. Not all players play to become a mass murderer. Some just play for fun and to appreciate lovely graphic art in a game.
2294,Menjelli177,"Jun  7, 2021",10,"Ótimo jogo. Eu amo como a tradição é opcional, mas ainda existe para aqueles que gostam, ao contrário do último DOOM. A jogabilidade é super divertida e rápida."
2295,Iceandfire5,"Jun  7, 2021",9,"I've been playing this game on and off since release, starting over whenever i did. However i finally finished the game. Doom eternal is a fun game that causes the player to actually get involved and think on their feet on higher difficulties. It is a good game and a good way to get you thinking. I wish there was a lower states mode i could play with friends like horde mode coop or something but the campaign is pretty good overall."
2296,Mrskully6517,"Jun  7, 2021",10,This is probably the most fun game you will ever play it is packed to the brim with gameplay and its very challenging too.
2297,Rawsauce11,"Jun  7, 2021",10,After putting in a hundred hours into the game I think I its safe to say that I think the game is a masterpiece and easily the best fps I have ever played it demands so much more of the player rather than playing mindlessly.
2298,Seth2Rogaine,"Jun  7, 2021",9,"Fun game, recommended to players with prior fast paced FPS experience. Average around 15 hours."
2299,Kemslif937,"Jun  7, 2021",9,"Good game, great graphics, very fun! sometimes it can be hard to find where you need to go, but that is only 1 bad thing, and the rest is good."

2302,Desordre551,"Jun  7, 2021",10,"Very good FPS, level design with small onions, catchy and punchy music. Really excellent. If you liked DOOM 2016, this is only the culmination of it, so go for it."

2305,Wufson4433,"Jun  7, 2021",9,VERY GOOD GAME! one of my favorites it has a lot of unique mechanics that take a bit to get used to but that adds a good challenge doom is so fun the demon models look sick and the combat is very fun and rewarding.
2306,Pre-worksnif77,"Jun  7, 2021",10,The doomiest doom since doom. From a strictly gameplay perspective this makes all other shooters obsolete.
2307,Pryion6547,"Jun  7, 2021",10,If you like ripping arms off demons and beating them to death with it then buy the game.
2308,Tatertots24,"Jun  7, 2021",10,"Bad-ass dude with guns that can shred demons at the gates of hell... what more can you ask for. The best single player shooter out there with loads of challenges and hidden items to collect. Quite an interesting story that sort of summarizes the entire journey of the Doom slayer and concludes it perfectly, at least according to me and for me."

2312,Psussido1523,"Jun  8, 2021",9,"ID Software understands their audience. What more can you ask for over killing hordes of demons to an epic metal soundtrack.

2316,Hunger7_tiger,"Jun  8, 2021",9,"Ich empfehle dringend, dieses Spiel zu kaufen, es ist alles, was ich von einem FPS-Spiel wollte und noch mehr. es kann manchmal etwas schwierig sein, aber es wäre langweilig, wenn es kein hartes Spiel wäre, da alle DOOM-Spiele ziemlich hart sind."
2317,Ukol52,"Jun  8, 2021",10,"Я играл в эту игру на кошмарном уровне сложности с нулевым опытом смерти, прежде чем играть в эту игру. это было утомительно, разочаровывающе и болезненно. Спустя более 20 часов я, наконец, достигаю последнего уровня и наслаждаюсь каждой минутой. Эта игра проверила мою точность, время реакции, управление ресурсами и память больше, чем любая другая игра, в которую я играл раньше. Я настоятельно рекомендую ее всем, кто с нетерпением ждет потрясающего шутера от первого лица."
2318,Engagebrain344,"Jun  8, 2021",10,"An epiphany of violence and gore. And art form of clicks and clacks. A picture painted of glory kills and fire. Hands down the best FPS money can buy, one that will challenge all of your physical gaming limits. Disgustingly well optimized. Stunning visuals."

2320,Claydavis3,"Jun  8, 2021",10,"This game is amazing!!! It is so action packed and I just love it. On top of that, it is so good looking and optimized."
2321,Idemas80,"Jun 10, 2021",9,Pretty great game to be honest. The puzzles and combat are hard but very fun.
2322,Waffless31,"Jun 10, 2021",10,There's a possibility our world could get taken over by demons in the future. This game is going to be a great help to add skill to your survival. Beast mode.
2323,Dickbut1,"Jun 10, 2021",9,"Just buy it. It's like nothing else out there right now, and heart-poundingly challenging at times. Lots of good bonuses and easter eggs as usual, blah blah blah. From what I can tell it's very well optimized as well, I never experienced and chugging at all. Couple freezes and one or two bugs which forced me to reset the level (which was frustrating), but overall a complete gem."
2324,Mannix199,"Jun 10, 2021",10,Uno dei migliori giochi che abbia mai giocato. Sul serio è eccellente e funziona bene.
2325,Yashcheritsa54,"Jun 10, 2021",10,"Эта игра превратила меня в машину для убийств. Ключ к завоеванию любви к игре, в том, чтобы играть по её правилам, как задумал разработчик, а не как хочется игроку."
2326,Colorgreens33,"Jun 10, 2021",10,Yes has you can see that pretty intense gameplay cause this game is a FAST-FPS like quake.The level design is just incredible and artistic direction is breathtaking. For all monster and mobs there is different AI for each one and all of the weapons are so much powerful. The most important for me is the diversification of the gameplay cause all demons have a strength and weakness.
2327,Pnatbads9,"Jun 10, 2021",9,Even on the easiest setting difficult and tough but really fun. Would recommend.
2328,Hanz_luger97,"Jun 10, 2021",10,This is actually a really good game. Whoever came up with these insane graphics is a genius.

2330,Spacelazers5,"Jun 10, 2021",10,"Gritty and fast great sound track that's heavy. Graphics are insane 4K Bloody and intense, everything DOOM promises to be and more. Great Game im really enjoying it."
2331,Lornak959,"Jun 10, 2021",9,It's very good. One of the fastest games I have ever played. Game is well optimized. Get on sale.
2332,Jerado78,"Jun 10, 2021",10,"As someone who thought DOOM 2016 was in some areas overrated, over hyped and overstated DOOM eternal proved to not only meet but exceed my expectations! gone are the bland, arid and generic levels of doom 2016 and in are the new vibrant, varied and frenetic levels of doom eternal. the soundtrack has been dialed up to 11. In a surprising twist by lowering the ammo capacity orders of magnitude from 2016 it makes the player switch weapons more on the fly, this has the effect of spicing up the game-play. Everything about DOOM eternal is polished, perfected and most importantly fun!"
2333,Dagfreten40,"Jun 10, 2021",10,First Doom game I've played. I was immediately blown away. It's just amazing. That's all that needs to be said.
2334,DivineProtein3,"Jun 10, 2021",10,"Fast & brutal FPS, the difficulty ramps up quite a bit but it is as expected in a game like this. If run & gun is your thing, if you enjoy violence & the devil."
2335,HandsomeDude,"Jun 11, 2021",9,First of all this game is awesome but it has it share of problems like the game being too hard or getting stuck on places i really loved the collectiables and skills you can use.The levels are made with love and passion and it shows.The multiplayer has seen better days you can barely find an match  what happened to the classic deathmatch style of doom? The story wasn't very good but the action was. By letting the player switch guns more often it makes you feel like you are in a rush to kill all the freaking demons with the ability to dash and double jump makes it even quicker.The enemies are deadly as ever you always have to keep running or they will kill you instanly no kidding.
2336,Loiii2,"Jun 13, 2021",10,"Another masterful DOOM game, with an amazing soundtrack from the legend Mick Gordon."
2337,JC_123,"Jun 28, 2021",9,"Very, very good. Probably the best first person shooter to come out since Half Life 2. Of course the two cannot be compared being such different games in such a rich genre. This game is punishing as it should be. It gives you the tools to pull off incredibly satisfying sequences against enemies who genuinely feel dangerous because of their fast movement and high damage output. Luckily, your movement and damage is just as potent. It really feels like The Only Thing They Fear Is You. (Best videogame OST period by the way)."
2338,Pace2506,"Jun 29, 2021",9,"First, i like to say like the doom 2016, i LIKE this game a LOT!! fast paced, difficult but challenging and very fun. As i say above, this game is much more difficult than its predecessor but it's giving more challenge and force you to be smart too. But what i don't like about this game is the platforming section which is annoying at times and slow down the pace. And the soundtrack? It's still good especially The Only Thing They Fear Is You and Meathook, but the overall soundtrack for me is still inferior to the doom 2016 soundtrack. But i recommend this game and buy it when on sale."
2339,KepasaAmigo,"Jul  1, 2021",9,Good old doom. U feel the power of the guns. Game is really hard on higher difficulty. Good old pew pew just with nice graphics now.
2340,tigermetals,"Jul  4, 2021",7,"7/10 TL:DR way too difficult, only for hardcore FPS gamers Pros:+ adding dashing and double jump off the bat+ still has some epic fights like in 2016+ a lot of cool things to do outside the campaign+ new weapon abilities+ entertaining scenes & dialogue+ easier to upgrade guns than in 2016Cons- Imbalanced overwhelming comically hilarious difficulty. Even with mods and toggling easy, the last few levels were completely bananas. The difficulty is great for hardcore FPS players, not fun, and inaccessible for everyone else.- ammo is scarce for the number of demons you have to deal with.- A giant toolbox to manage during intense fights, not a big detractor but could be streamlined like in DOOM 16.- Buff Totems - a hidden totem on the map that spawns and buffs current demons until you find it and destroy it. The demons are so strong they can kill you late game on easy if you can't find the totem in time.this should be something you can turn off.- certain runes should not be runes but in the game already, ie ""better air control"", how about just make that a thing in the first place.- the upgrade system is more convoluted than 2016 Other thoughts:I installed mods to try to mitigate the difficulty and it made things ok until the last few levels where things became overwhelming again. You have to be some sort of hardcore genius to play this game even on normal (hurt me plenty) without mods. And I would not recommend this game to my worse enemy on console due to the controller. This could have been a 9 or 10 but the devs got in their own way imo"
2341,ICDP,"Jul  9, 2021",4,"This is NOT Doom.  It is Doom Raider, a cross between Tomb Raider and Super Mario jumpy climby platform puzzles and some Doom weapons and creatures. It misses the point of Doom where you shoot your way through hordes of increasingly tough demons with increasingly powerful weapons.  This game has you constantly low on ammo and always doing the boring special takedowns so you can get the ammo to fly out of a demons guts unitl you run out of ammo a few seconds later and have to rinse/repeat.  Combat is literally a series of special kill animations that became boring and just destroyed thepoint of Doom. It has literally zero redeeming features."
2342,Bathhouse9000,"Jul  8, 2021",10,One of the best fps arena shooters ever made. Improves on the sequel on almost every way and makes for brilliant action game.
2343,robogeisha,"Jul  8, 2021",2,"Practically everything that they got so right in Doom 2016 is spoiled here, the freedom of approach and endless variety of encounters that it successfully inherited from the original Doom is all gone, it's now just the same routine over and over until it's excruciatingly dull. There's basically only one way to play it. This is the 3rd time I've started the game... I got about 2 hours in before I was bored and frustrated, which is at least more than I've managed before but there's nothing there to make me want to go back to it any time soon."
2344,Yasha1283,"Jul  9, 2021",10,"Шутер, где используется практически все механики, которая предлагает игра. Такое редко где увидишь."
2345,Moisty_fan2,"Jul 10, 2021",9,Fun shooter. Improves upon a lot of the previous doom game and adds more depth. The levels are a lot more varied and are much more enjoyable to explore. The improved movement is a joy.
2346,Chanflame3,"Jul 11, 2021",10,"Once you get used to the platforming stuff, it becomes a really fun and exciting game to play."
2347,Blackdung7,"Jul 11, 2021",10,Doom Eternal is the most fun and well designed single player shooter that I've played in a long time.
2348,finalfantasy88,"Jul 12, 2021",10,"Doom Eternal is my second favorite doom game after Doom3, beautiful level design and epic soundtrack make this memorable experience!"

2351,Beats4Dad,"Jul 14, 2021",10,"Some of the most fluid and satisfying gameplay in a shooter. Zipping around and killing demons at fast pace with an amazing soundtrack to back you up, what's not to love?"
2352,Xestr1k,"Jul 15, 2021",10,"Probably the best singleplayer shooter I've played. Blows the previous games out the water in terms of combat mechanics, enemy ai and movement. Platforming is massive improvement over the Doom 2016 which had instant death from falling down from platforms. In this game if you fall off a platform it just takes a bit of health and respawns you back. The platforming itself is nice breather from combat and is quick, easy and fluid to complete due to enchanted movement."
2353,Laurexisop,"Jul 15, 2021",10,"i never seen any bugs,it have good level designs,it have exotic guns etc. i like it"
2354,SysThetem49,"Jul 16, 2021",10,Great combat arena shooter. Love the graphics and retro style that pays homage to original doom games.

2356,Foolofatook84,"Jul 17, 2021",10,Much better game than the previous Doom. Tougher but fair. Better combat and more tactical. Movement is bonkers fast. Levels are more interesting. Whats not to love?
2357,FAireSTONE35,"Jul 17, 2021",10,Really fun frantic action shooter. Loved everything about it. Though the multiplayer is interesting it gets boring quick.
2358,The21rdage,"Jul 17, 2021",9,"Doom Eternal tops its predecessor by adding much need depth to the combat, enhancing the slayers maneuverability, more interesting levels/locations, better more aggressive AI, rock solid id tech 7 and once again killer soundtrack by Mick Gordon."
2359,darknessshadow9,"Jul 18, 2021",0,"One of the absolute worst games thats been released in a long time, a blot on the legacy of Doom and the (formerly) good reputations of both Id Software and Bethesda Games. If you expect anything of value or any shreds of entertainment to be had from this game. An absolute slog at best, complete sewage at worst its shocking that something of this quality can be released in this golden age of gaming. Boring, bland, bothersome gameplay, that punishes the player for trying anything outside of the hardset limits the game has in place. Why they did this? I can't even imagine why, maybe to appeal to older games who have gotten slow and stupid in their advanced age or young kids that can barely count to 3 yet but the design choice is truly appalling and downright insulting to the average gamer. A drastic decrease in weapon and enemy variety from past releases, the same imps and cacodemons either reskinned or outright reused in parts of the game you'd hope for something fresh. I'm talking 20 hours in and its the same enemies you're expected to be tackled in the same way. The bosses suffer from this problem too, the same cyberdemons or barons of hell barely sized up and maybe with a new coat of paint dropped in almost at random seemingly just to pad the game out instead of testing the players skills (something they realized they wouldn't need to do, due to the redundant gameplay i mentioned earlier). The graphics are a major step back in terms of quality. Doom 2016 looks lightyears ahead in terms of quality, shoddy texture work, low poly models and atrociously bad animations, the absolutely rushed state of the game is on full display in an area you expect even the most lackluster of games in this current generation to at least somewhat succeed in. In terms of weapon variety, as I mentioned earlier, severely lacking in variety. Only 3 weapons available in the entirety of the game, one being a hidden reward from a boring collectathon sidequest and even then not worth the time to unlock it, as I've already explained at length how the game punishes any variety. The HUD and UI is laughably bad, looking like it was designed in some cheap knockoff of photoshop, barely conveying any information regarding damage or the status of your character to the player, as well as cluttering the screen with useless text and effects. Speaking of the character, Doomguys design is an extreme downgrade from past titles. In a cheap attempt to capture nostalgia from past games it just comes off as being an homage to the artwork of Tom of Finland. Gaudy and grotesquely built its a slap in the face to human anatomy and good character design across so many other games. The art direction of the entire game feels this way, definitely not aided by the low quality graphics. Going from gross and gory, to extravagantly bland, I'd hate to see what the concept art was like if whats on display in the final game looks this bad. One would expect sprawling scenic environments of a real hell on earth, all that you get greeted with is a low poly 4 year olds idea of hell. The story is truly the crown jewel of just how bad this game gets. Nonsensical boring dialogue, lengthy drab cutscenes and retcons of the worst degree are just some of the gems in store for you if you pick this game up. The character of Samual Hayden has been absolutely mangled, going from proud noble futurist scientist, to disturbed, almost child predator creep. His weird obsession with the frighteningly young intern character reflects a strange creative choice by the devs, to the point I almost believe someone on the writing team was projecting their own desires on this cast of characters. The character of Doomguy truly got the brunt of these bad decisions. The cool, restrained, angry demeanor presented in 2016 has been completely replaced with this psychopathic, enraged persona that isn't helped by the awful voice acting, that I can only guess was provided by some bum on the street they hired to record his lines. The voice acting problem is reflected on the entirety of the extensive new cast of characters but is notably bad for Doomguy. The story is completely incoherent with timeskipping and constant planet hopping that would put the modern Star Wars movies to shame. The twist that the Dark Lord thats been hyped up the entire game being Doomguy from an alternate timeline comes out of complete left field, due to the amount of hilariously bad red herrings and false twists I almost feel must have been left over from old versions of the script that they must never have been improved upon. This trainwreck of a game truly goes to show how far down the level of quality has dropped for AA devs. The reputation of these companies I don't  think can ever be recovered just because of how hard they dropped the ball on this one. Why something like this was made and released, especially from the devs that brought us Morrowwind and Wolfensteinn. My final review for this game is a concrete 0 out of 10...."
2360,boeph,"Jul 19, 2021",8,"Не смотря на некоторые нюансы, Doom Eternal это прекрасный сиквел, он прокачал то что и так работало, отсек все ненужное, и подал к столу. Doom почти никогда не базировался на сюжетной составляющей, она всегда была ли ж стимулом изничтожать альтернативно живых существ, поэтому Doom с подзаголовком Eternal не совершил революции в этом плане, если вы ждёте от Dooma сюжета то это довольно бессмысленное занятие. Для меня Doom 2020 года отличный шутер с крепким геймплеем, который в тех условиях которые создали разработчики прекрасно работает."

2373,Satangodgod6,"Jul 21, 2021",10,RIP AND TEAR ! In my opinion Doom Eternal is one the best singleplayer shooters from 2020. I just received the game not long ago and the amount of fun is enormous. From my perpective 10/10 in the case of gameplay. Story ? maybe 8/10 or 8.5/10 its good . But the doom is more about the action then story . Story is there to add climate.
2374,Proka4859,"Jul 21, 2021",10,"Lo que se puede decir de esta obra maestra que ya no se haya dicho? En serio, este juego está tan bien hecho, que incluso alguien a quien generalmente no le gustan los fps se las arregla para jugarlo sin parar."

The Gameplay: Faster and more challenging. The Weapons: Super satisfiying and immensely powerful. The Music: You already know has amazing it is. In every way, it's a step up from Doom 2016, and then some. But come with a warning, it doesn't pull it's punches. You will die on anything past ultra nightmare, a lot. But it's really good at teaching you the way it wants you play. And if you let it, it's one of the most fun and stressful things you could ask for. It's Doom, what more could you ask for?"

2390,Boomisdoom25,"Jul 23, 2021",10,10/10 best game play and best soundtrack. Graphics look sick and more like classic doom games.
2391,De_blian23,"Jul 23, 2021",9,Ce jeu m'a donné tellement de testostérone que je me suis séparé de mes hormones œstrogènes juste pour combattre mon clone féminin.
2392,Smeltit3333,"Jul 23, 2021",10,I like shooting demons and chainsawing them apart. This provides this. 10/10.
2393,Domosax19,"Jul 23, 2021",10,"Extremely fun, challenging, deep and beautifully designed. This best singleplayer arena and movement shooter ever made."
2394,Occamscream205,"Jul 23, 2021",10,This is the best doom no contest. Combat in this game makes other shooters look like ****
2395,Xtcvv1997,"Jul 23, 2021",9,"Классный геймплей. Потрясающий саундтрек. Классное оружие. Классные враги. У меня отстойный FPS, и эта игра заставила меня почувствовать, что я хорош. Определенно стоит поиграть. Я не должен был ждать так долго, чтобы пойти на это."
2396,Samuelel1ihiden,"Jul 23, 2021",9,"Killing demons on campaign is nice and all but... I wish there was more to do except battlemode, dlc and complete milestones."
2397,30Quanish,"Jul 23, 2021",10,Wow mick gordon is selling a free game when you buy his soundtrack! How cool!
2398,Largep555,"Jul 23, 2021",10,This game makes you feel like a real badass once you master its mechanics. Music is great. Story is neat. Level design is great. Graphics are great. Gunplay is amazing. Sound effects are great. It's a real blast!
2399,Inusaltia8759,"Jul 23, 2021",10,By far one of the best FPS game I've ever played. Way better than Doom 2016. This game is addicting and really fun.
2400,Wivndo684L,"Jul 23, 2021",9,"Shooting, stabbing, pulling limbs apart from demon creatures... and collecting little toy figures. What's not to love about this game."
2401,e1m5,"Jul 24, 2021",10,"I think this game is a masterpiece. It's absolutely gorgeous to look at, hectic to play and so cleverly designed. From one point-of-view, the entire game seems to be one gradually paced tutorial in how to become the ultimate Doomslayer; being able to utilise all of his extensive capabilities to annihilate demon scum at a frenetic pace without getting bruised. You will get bruised learning how to do this, but by the end your competence in abilities will have you zipping around in a blur like an unstoppable, godlike killing machine with the viscera of your slain foes raining down around you in a mist of blood, giblets and fireballs. It's everything Doom should be. The Doomslayer is such a baddass, and he makes you want to become the baddest badass you can be, and that's the whole point. There is no action shooter in the same class as this, that I've come across. The soundtrack is perfect, there is a lot of depth to mods and upgrades and limitless replayability with hunting secrets, achievements and unlocking abilities of many, many flavors. Platforming elements have been introduced which serve well to add a new dynamic to the gameplay. I found this game to be a little intimidating at first, but stick with it and you will understand why it's so great. I also find it more enjoyable and less frustrating than it's precursor."
2402,Darkranger427,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"This is, by far, the best FPS I've ever played! So much action and entertainment that I never want to stop playing. Lots of quick thinking and some problem/puzzle solving, both creating an amazing game; it has to be one of my favorites. Would 100% recommend to everyone!"
2403,Zimpt3,"Jul 25, 2021",9,Incredibly satisfying and fun game. I love the retro look reminds me of the original doom games.
2404,Senor2Vac,"Jul 25, 2021",10,Everything that I could I've asked from a DOOM game and much more. In this era of corporate greed and games destroyed by p2w and toxic multiplayer there is one who middle fingers them and proves once in for all that singleplayer is still relevant.
2405,Gittbrainy87,"Jul 25, 2021",10,Doom: Eternal improves on the 2016 reboot in every way. Amazing game. Runs good too.
2406,Ngade1351,"Jul 25, 2021",9,"Great game, shout out to the devs for making a hard but fun game. Id tech 7 is also godly engine."
2407,Bigdongus30,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"One of the greatest FPS I have ever played, decent story, unforgettable game-play and absolute testosterone inducing music!!!"
2408,Kellios62849,"Jul 25, 2021",9,"Oh my god.... So this game is great. its fun and just enjoyable really working upon what DOOM (2016) laid down. But god, oh holy great one this game can get hard. im trying out a %100 Nightmare run and im losing my mind. and im gonna try Ultra Nightmare that is nightmare but one life the whole time. i dont know why im commiting so much but i must."
2409,ReturnToMonke75,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"Truly the best fps I've ever played. The environment, the enemies, the combat and it's all tied together with the best video game soundtrack that has ever graced this earth."
2410,CrimsonGin68,"Jul 25, 2021",9,"Fast paced, demon-killing action, whats not to love. Game looks good and runs smooth as butter on any pc."
2411,Silentdeadly100,"Jul 25, 2021",10,I was so bored of FPS. But doom eternal is an absolute delight. Only issue i have with the game is the crashing....Devs...you have made an absolute gem.
2412,Obtrice42,"Jul 25, 2021",9,Love the visuals and gameplay... HATE THE FRIGGIN' Save system!! Huge progress lost because of unclear save rules. BE CAREFUL!!
2413,Avaaa745,"Jul 25, 2021",9,"Es Doom. Tiene una banda sonora increíble, el bucle de juego es satisfactorio, tiene un buen desafío y el diseño de niveles ofrece muchos lugares para secretos y estrategia. Recomendado."
2414,Knoove36,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"Fun and gory game, just like how it's supposed to be! Heavy metal demons dead good game."
2415,Xuclih857,"Jul 25, 2021",9,"Overall great game. The story from Doom Eternal (DE) has been expanded: telling the origins of the Doom Slayer/Marine, while creating new lore for the new series. Those expecting Doom 2016 gameplay are in for a surprise as the DE ramps up the speed and adds more classical gaming elements such as 1UP pickup and ""cartoonish"" sounds (ie. blood splat sounds effects). Some weapons have been nerfed from previous series, thus allowing more of a balanced and fair but fun gameplay."
2416,Blueskin577,"Jul 25, 2021",10,This game is insanely poggers. Its like a shot of cocaine will jumping in the air and rocketing demons in the face.
2417,Vig1or4,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"Ce jeu est incroyablement amusant d'une manière malade et tordue !! Vérifie aussi ces réflexes car tu vas en avoir besoin pour ça. Le moteur Id Tech est follement optimisé et a fière allure aussi ! Je recommanderais ceci en dehors du jeu de base seul. Soyez averti cependant, le dernier pourrait devenir fou et ils ont doublé leur folie pour cette entrée, en particulier dans les paramètres de difficulté les plus élevés."
2418,Skekel5,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"Bu oyun eskisinden çok daha iyi. Bir öncekinin başarısız olduğu tüm alanlarda ivme kazandı. Hızlı tempolu dövüş ve strateji, saatlerce kanlı eğlence sağlar. Sahip oldukları savaş döngüleriyle paranın satın alabileceği en iyi tek oyunculu FPS deneyimlerinden biri olarak tarihe geçmelerinin bir nedeni var."
2419,Malrak21,"Jul 25, 2021",10,"It's such an intense game. It's brutal, I love it. Almost perfect game honestly."
2420,Societyliver55,"Jul 25, 2021",10,Best shooter game I have ever played. It combat is soo good. Much better than Doom 2016.
2421,Boofenjoyer974,"Jul 25, 2021",10,This game is totally awesome. Rip the heads off demons is dank. The big green suit angry man is pretty cool.
2422,CrystalWeed420,"Jul 25, 2021",9,Looks great runs great feels and movement is smooth. Big guns big demons big soundtrack big fun.
2423,Happygill4,"Jul 26, 2021",9,Viscerally cathartic. Animalistic violent. Insanely addictive game. Pure dopamine inducer.
2424,Turberist6,"Jul 26, 2021",9,"Great Game, perfect value, amazing arena shooter. Improves upon DOOM 2016, while removing nothing bad from the series. A great game for people looking for a adrenaline rushing shooter."
2425,Rawsaucy1999,"Jul 26, 2021",10,What else is there to say? Go friggen play it. Most fun I've ever had playing a game.
2426,SigmaRule445,"Jul 26, 2021",10,Doom Eternal has created a new standard for gaming. Other fps games are slow and boring.
2427,Sich93,"Jul 26, 2021",9,Dies ist ehrlich gesagt eines der besten Spiele der letzten fünf Jahre. Wirklich lustige Sachen.
2428,Istoaby7384,"Jul 26, 2021",9,"Je pourrais écrire une longue critique ou je pourrais recommencer à jouer à doom éternel. Si vous aimez les jeux de tir difficiles et rapides, achetez-le. Est en vente assez souvent,"
2429,Moshibax5345,"Jul 26, 2021",8,Its like a puzzle game if the puzzle was on fire and trying to kill you with demons.
2430,Piccolo26,"Jul 26, 2021",9,"Un gioco incredibile pieno di sangue, adrenalina, armi e qualsiasi cosa possa far sorridere."
2431,Chiiiiiie4,"Jul 26, 2021",10,When you start keybinding weapons this game is godly and smooth. Every PC should do this.
2432,Lummkg5,"Jul 27, 2021",10,"A absolute blast to play. Varied crazy levels. Fixes the problem of Doom 2016 which had very samey levels. Combat is just simply smoother, more complex and better."
2433,Newark29,"Aug  1, 2021",9,Great game. Gameplay is prime level master class stuff. Levels are really cool.
2434,Francisco45,"Aug  2, 2021",10,"Este juego es la polla nada que ver con la mierda de industria actual , battleroyales y basuras de esas este juego esta chapado a la antigua y le queda de putamadre , tienes que jugarlo si o si"
2435,shenkenhigh,"Aug 13, 2021",10,"That's an outstandingly good game. It's masterpiece, but it's very difficult on Nightmare! more difficult than Doom 2016 which i cleared easily on Nightmare! But marauders and how i feel, that Icon of Sin, are ""fairly"" UNFAIR bosses. I recommend all players on nightmare to farm some Extra Lives."
2436,AJCk19,"Aug 14, 2021",8,It improves on everything from the 2016 version of Doom. Plus it is very fun to watch other people play on Twitch.
2437,Chocomint,"Aug 19, 2021",10,"This is everything you could ask from a single player FPS even if you don't like all the fictional theme;First of all, the pc optimization is one of the best I've ever seen; then you have the smooth movement that comes with the non-stop violent action in very well-designed platforms and levels that make the game even better. This is also one the few single player FPS that pushes you to think before you engage in a battle with all the variety of enemies and weapons, everything has a purpose and that's what makes doom eternal one of the best in its genre. The only downside is I can't imagine how you could possibly top this one because I don't see anything you could do better, so good luck for the future fps devs."
2438,ShammiSham,"Aug 21, 2021",10,Doom eternal has triggered my addiction receptors like no other shooter has.
2439,Crimson5,"Aug 23, 2021",9,"Эта игра стала моим любимым шутером. Музыка, графика, стилистика и конечно геймплей на высшем уровне. Единственное что не выделяется это сюжет, он неплохой но он спрятан в местной википедии которую лично мне читать лень.Моя оценка 9/10."
2440,Renaigse,"Aug 23, 2021",8,"Оч крутой, диначичный и мясной шутан, гораздо лучше чем предыдущий дум, хоть и модельки весьма спорные."
2441,M300,"Aug 25, 2021",1,"This game has lost everything that made the original DOOM 2016 so likeable.I have no need to put more, this is just a very short analysis from my perspective."
2442,MaxmilianKohler,"Aug 28, 2021",5,"This game is pretty bad. Story is nonexistent. At mission 3 they started giving me 6 ammo to kill 30 enemies, even after I chose all the ammo upgrades. Then I got to another area where the path forward was completely hidden. I had to look up a guide on how to proceed... And then again, another path forward extremely esoteric, and again and again... wtf. I find so many things about this game way more annoying than Doom 2016. The people saying this game is better are out of their damn minds. It seems like there are so many poorly designed things in this game. Many really frustrating/annoying and buggy things that make me think very poorly of the people that made this game. If you want to collect all the items/secrets it's pretty much required to use a guide. Even with them being revealed on the map it's still extremely obscure how you're supposed to get to many of them. I see later on that you're supposed to use the chainsaw to get ammo, but that's a really bad mechanic due to the fact that it only regens 1/3 and you need 3/3 to kill big guys, so you can't just waste it on little guys to get ammo or you won't have it when you need it. Difficulty level of certain parts was just ridiculous. I've been playing competitive FPS games at a high level for over a decade. I had to BOTH set it to the easiest difficulty AND choose the special armor option that basically makes you invincible. There's just too much going on at once, too fast. Two bosses plus 15 different enemies shooting, throwing, and charging you from all sides. Pure chaos. The way the battle was designed just completely zapped my interest. I found it more enjoyable on the lowest difficulty where I could actually focus on using the many tools they give you, rather than just running around trying not to get hit. They even nerfed the BFG to the point where it only kills small to medium enemies. The last fight was dumb and more of the same chaos. I was glad when the game was over. I definitely regret buying this game. Ancient Gods DLC 1 is just more of the same but more fighting, harder enemies, and new enemies. And even more problems that constantly make me say ""what a garbage game"". Ancient Gods DLC 2 - finally they do something right. The sentinel hammer is good design. And they finally make the auto shotgun usable in certain situations. Final boss fight was incredibly boring and a total waste of time."
2443,skdcraw,"Aug 29, 2021",9,"masterpiece. In a word, masterpiece. The game successfully delivers everything it promises you. Although I hate the arcade FPS genre, this game is amazing. First of all, the graphics are very beautiful even though they don't show themselves in the game. When we say beautiful graphics, we immediately think of meadow grass as in RDR. However, the graphics that we cannot appreciate due to the pace of this game are amazing. They take damage from wherever you hit the demons. You can clearly see how each bullet you shoot can cause damage. In addition, the game has added weak points to most enemies so that you do not rely only on your strength. If you don't think tactically and jump in front of everyone with your gun, you will die. The biggest mistake in the game's gameplay is that even after defeating the guy called Marauder as a boss, he throws it in front of you. The difficulty of the game should be enjoyable, if it is time consuming, it will be boring and annoying. Another good thing about the game is that you can enjoy it without knowing anything about its story. We used to do this for Half-Life back then. This game is like that. It doesn't have much of a story, but its lore is vast. If you want, you can also enjoy the story by reading the papers you have collected. Let's not forget the music, make sure to play the game with headphones. The music of the game is so appropriate to the theme of ""violence"" that the music fixes the idea in your mind: ""They are not yours, you are their enemy"". Although I completely turn off the music of the game and turn on classical music, the effects in the game prevent the calm. Great job done on the sound. I don't like FPS. I don't like arcade FPS at all. However, there is little that can be said badly about this game. A masterpiece that everyone should try. God bless hands of everyone who contributed."
2444,Darzv9,"Aug 29, 2021",10,Amazing game. I love how it isn't mindless as Doom 2016 a lot more strategy in the combat.
2445,Strafre4k,"Aug 29, 2021",10,Best game is the series since Doom 1. Game is a masterpiece. Quake meets Devil May Cry.
2446,Rot3ez,"Aug 29, 2021",10,Pure fun packed in a video game. Love the retro look that is more accurate to the originals. You can say its one hell of a game.
2447,Purepwnage90,"Aug 29, 2021",10,One of the best shooters ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2448,9Inex9,"Aug 30, 2021",10,I think of crack cocaine with heavy metal. That is this game in a nut shell.
2449,Bignubbaz4,"Sep  3, 2021",10,"Pretty much improves almost everything from Doom 2016 to be one of the best shooters of all time. The flaws of bad third act, game getting repetitive, combat lacking depth and being too braindead are gone.  Anyone who prefers Doom 2016 is only nostalgia riding a good but heavily flawed game. Eternal is objectively better game period."
2450,For2gonepmp,"Sep  7, 2021",9,Must buy for arena shooter/movement shooter fans. Massive improvement over the predecessor which I felt was overrated and boring.
2451,Adgr1ma,"Sep 14, 2021",10,Pretty sick game. From graphics to gameplay to soundtrack its the bomb. Hard to find any flaws with it.
2452,MantTea,"Sep 15, 2021",10,One of the best shooter game I ever playedMasterpiece Soundtrack: CheckBest fps combat: CheckDepth in combat: CheckAmazing Booses: Check Bad:The bosses in Doom 2016 were betterAnnoying Swamp What are you waiting for just buy this game.
2453,Extremo9,"Sep 15, 2021",10,Amo mucho este juego. La música y el combate son demasiado divertidos. No puedo recomendarlo lo suficiente.
2454,RaydeBrigade,"Sep 17, 2021",10,This is the most fun you'll ever have playing a video game in your entire life. DOOM Eternal is awesome and if you think otherwise you must be stupid.
2455,WPB,"Sep 21, 2021",10,"Gifted to my 3 year old cousin, she loved ripping apart demons and watching there guts fly everywhere, t-bagging her victims. They grow up so fast."
2456,Randomloser,"Sep 21, 2021",10,This game is the perfection of arena shooters with a fast and an intense gameplay that makes me sweat with a really good story and the 2021 waifu award goes to the SLAYER
2457,Rob_Cop,"Sep 22, 2021",9,"Игра очень неплоха. Сюжет интересный, но надо много читать из записок и буквально выдергивать информацию оттуда. Бесит сильно паркур, особенно на предпоследней локации. В целом игра хорошая"
2458,Bushido95,"Sep 28, 2021",8,Та самая игра в которой боссом являешься ты. Безумный динамический шутер под ещё более безумный саунд.
2459,LastGirlAlive,"Oct  6, 2021",0,"This and the classic Dooms are the only ones that I have ever played. I didn't expect this to feel like the old games and it really didn't. So that is something to keep in mind for people like me. About this game, everything is almost perfect, EVERYTHING. sound, game-play, leveling, story (that I didn't read carefully). Also, I really really recommend you to play this on the hard mode (not the hardest, just one level bellow the hardest). It was at time really frustrating but it will become rewarding after some time."
2460,Walkiri2,"Oct  8, 2021",10,"After trailer and short gameplay I thought I will not like this game. But after a few minutes I was thrilled! They move so fast! You cannot stop. You need to use all the equipment and keep changing and adjusting it. This game is EPIC, dripping with adrenaline pumped with hard core music! I never thought that I would receive this much adrenaline in singleplayer game. Only odd things are ballet jumping sequences ;) Game is filled with epic locations and bosses."
2461,Klosiak,"Oct 15, 2021",0,A great game with an old school feeling. I loved to play and finish this title :)
2462,Leontorres7,"Oct 17, 2021",10,"This game is glorious! Pure non stop fun and adrenaline, a must buy, best FPS ever."
