Sure, it has some visual bugs and what not, but it was never unplayable (I'm running it on high with no ray tracing with a rtx2060 laptop). Great world building, music, art, graphics, and gameplay. Questionable skill balance, mediocre character creation. Fun game.\\r Didn't find too many bugs, but one involving Jacky and a gun fused into his hand really ruined the immersion and story telling for a particular cutscene. Again, nothing that made the game unplayable, just wish it had some more polish to it.\\r Aside of bugs, my only gripes about this game are the clunky feel of the default controls for keyboard, and an underwhelming character creation. It's 2077 and I should be able to craft flawless waifus with prefect skin and everything, and yet I'm stuck with something that is distinctly human. Jokes aside, I wish it had a character creation as detailed as something like black desert online, or at least tools like more hairs, sliders, sculpting, custom RGB color selection, etc. for your characters to have the potential to look that way.\\r I haven't finished the story so I can't provide feedback on it, but so far it hasn't disappointed. Can't say that its perfect, as I feel like I'm forced to play as V, rather than my own character unlike other open world RPG like Skyrim.\\r In terms of skills, its horribly unbalanced. 20% of perks are very powerful/useful while the rest are either too situational or the effects are too underpowered. But I guess it rewards people who understands the value of each perk?\\r tldr; this game is great. not perfect, but fun. lets hope cdprojekt red fixes the bugs so more people can enjoy the game the way it was intended to be. would give it a 9/10 but 10/10 to counter the review bombings… Expand\""
